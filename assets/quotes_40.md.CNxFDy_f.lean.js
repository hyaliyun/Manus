Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), policies and reforms were introduced with the aim of transforming traditional gender roles and promoting gender equality as part of the broader communist ethos of equality and solidarity. # Before the Chinese Civil War Historically, Chinese society was deeply patriarchal, with women subjected to the confines of Confucian family values that emphasized filial piety, female chastity, and the superiority of men. Women had limited rights and were largely excluded from political or economic participation. Practices such as foot binding and arranged marriages were prevalent, and education for women was not widely endorsed. # Impact of the Chinese Civil War 1. **Participation in the War:** The Chinese Civil War and the concurrent struggle against Japanese occupation during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) saw significant participation by women in both combatant and non-combatant roles. The CPC actively recruited women into its ranks, encouraging their participation in the revolutionary struggle. This experience was empowering, offering women a sense of purpose and belonging outside the traditional confines of the home. 2. **Legal Reforms:** After the establishment of the PRC, the Communist government undertook extensive reforms to improve the status of women. The New Marriage Law of 1950 was one of the first major legal reforms, which aimed to dismantle the feudal marriage system. It outlawed practices such as concubinage, child betrothal, and dowry, and promoted free choice in marriage, monogamy, and equal rights in the marriage relationship. 3. **Education and Employment:** The government launched initiatives to promote female education and encourage women's participation in the workforce. Women were given access to education and job opportunities, significantly altering their social and economic status. The notion “women hold up half the sky,” popularized during the Mao era, epitomized the state’s efforts to promote gender equality. 4. **Political Participation:** Women were also encouraged to participate in political processes. The establishment of the All-China Women's Federation in 1949 was a key step in mobilizing women to participate in nation-building and social reforms. Women began to serve in political positions, although their representation in leadership roles remained limited. # Changes in Role and Status The role and status of women in Chinese society underwent significant changes due to these reforms and policies: - **Economic Participation:** Women became an integral part of the workforce, contributing to the nation's economic development in both agricultural and industrial sectors. - **Educational Achievements:** Increased access to education led to higher literacy rates among women and greater female representation in higher education. - **Legal Rights:** The legal reforms established a framework for protecting women's rights, although the implementation and enforcement of these rights varied across different regions and time periods. - **Family Dynamics:** The promotion of gender equality affected traditional family structures, giving women a more active role in family decisions and reducing the prevalence of patriarchal authority. # Challenges and Limitations Despite these advances, challenges persisted. Traditional attitudes and gender norms were not easily displaced, and women continued to face discrimination and inequality, particularly in rural areas. The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) also had a complex impact on women; while it mobilized women to participate in revolutionary activities, the chaotic period disrupted many aspects of social life and led to the persecution of numerous women. # Conclusion The Chinese Civil War and the subsequent establishment of the People's Republic of China marked a significant turning point in the status and roles of women in Chinese society. Through legal reforms, social policies, and active participation in the workforce and political arena, women experienced unprecedented changes in their rights and societal positions. While substantial progress was made, the journey toward gender equality in China was, and remains, an ongoing process with continuous challenges and adaptations."},{"prompt":"Economic, Social, and Demographic Impacts","completion":"The economic, social, and demographic impacts of significant historical events, such as wars, revolutions, and policy shifts, are profound, reshaping societies in complex and durable ways. While examples from various contexts can highlight these effects, let's consider the general impacts of such transformative periods. # Economic Impacts **1. Reconstruction and Recovery:** Post-conflict or post-revolution periods often require extensive reconstruction of infrastructure, which can stimulate economic growth through increased government and foreign investment in rebuilding efforts. However, the initial destruction during these events can severely impact economic productivity and development. **2. Shifts in Economic Policy:** Transformative events often lead to significant shifts in economic policy. For example, the post-World War II era saw the adoption of the Marshall Plan, which significantly impacted Europe's economic recovery and political alignment. Similarly, revolutions can lead to nationalization of industries or economic liberalization, depending on the ideological outcomes of the events. **3. Impact on Trade:** Wars and revolutions can disrupt trade routes, leading to shortages of critical goods and inflation. Over time, however, new trade relationships may emerge, potentially benefiting previously marginalized economies by integrating them into global trade networks. # Social Impacts **1. Changes in Social Structure:** Social hierarchies and class structures can be drastically altered. For instance, the abolition of feudal systems in many revolutionary contexts has led to the emergence of new social classes and the redistribution of wealth. **2. Gender Roles:** Significant events often lead to changes in gender roles, especially when women participate in the workforce or military during conflicts. These changes can lead to greater gender equality, although such gains are not always permanently sustained. **3. Cultural Shifts:** Wars and revolutions often spur significant cultural shifts, leading to new forms of artistic expression, changes in social norms, and sometimes, the suppression of certain cultural practices. The impact on national identity can be profound, with increased patriotism or, conversely, disillusionment. # Demographic Impacts **1. Population Loss and Displacement:** Conflicts typically result in loss of life and displacement. The demographic impact of such losses can affect generations, as seen in the aftermath of World War I and II. Displacement also leads to significant refugee crises, which can impact neighboring regions and beyond. **2. Migration Patterns:** Significant events often result in changes to migration patterns, whether due to displacement, economic opportunities, or changes in immigration policy. Post-conflict migrations can lead to significant diasporas, which, in turn, can impact the cultural and economic landscapes of host countries. **3. Birth Rates:** Demographic shifts can also occur in birth rates, with post-war baby booms being a common phenomenon. Conversely, during economic recessions or periods of political unrest, birth rates may decline due to uncertainty and decreased economic security. # Conclusion The economic, social, and demographic impacts of wars, revolutions, and transformative policy changes are interconnected, reflecting the complex ways in which societies adapt to and are shaped by these events. While the immediate aftermath often involves significant challenges, including economic downturns, social upheaval, and demographic shifts, these periods can also lay the groundwork for substantial recovery, innovation, and renewal, depending upon the resilience of the affected societies and the policies adopted in the wake of these events."},{"prompt":"Economic, Social, and Demographic Impacts of the chinese civil war","completion":"The Chinese Civil War, which primarily took place between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in two main phases from 1927 to 1936 and then from 1946 to 1950, had profound economic, social, and demographic impacts on China. The outcome of this conflict, which ultimately led to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 and the retreat of the KMT to Taiwan, set the stage for massive transformations in Chinese society. # Economic Impacts **Infrastructure and Production:** The prolonged warfare inflicted heavy damage on China’s infrastructure and industrial capacity, disrupting agricultural production and leading to significant economic hardship. Railroads, bridges, and factories were often targets during the conflict, resulting in a substantial setback to the economy. **Economic Policies:** After coming to power in 1949, the CPC implemented sweeping economic reforms aimed at recovering from the war and transitioning China into a socialist planned economy. Land reform redistributed land from landlords to peasants, which, while improving agricultural productivity in the short term, also led to significant turmoil and violence. **Industrialization:** The early years of the PRC saw efforts to rebuild and enhance industrial production, laying the foundation for future economic policies, including the Great Leap Forward, which aimed at rapidly transforming China from an agrarian economy into a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. # Social Impacts **Transformation of Social Class:** The land reforms and subsequent socialist policies dismantled traditional hierarchies and landlord classes, radically altering China’s social structure. The elevation of peasants and workers to a more central role in society aimed to eliminate feudal remnants and promote socialist values. **Gender Equality:** The new government promoted gender equality as a fundamental principle, a stark departure from traditional Confucian gender norms. Laws implemented during and after the Civil War sought to increase women’s rights in marriage, property, and work, contributing to significant changes in their societal status. **Education and Healthcare:** Efforts were made to expand access to education and healthcare as part of the broader project of socialist construction, aiming to eradicate illiteracy and improve public health, which had deteriorated during years of conflict. # Demographic Impacts **Population Displacement:** The war caused significant population displacement, with millions of refugees moving across the country to escape the fighting. The establishment of the PRC also led to the relocation of many people, either through government policies or as a consequence of economic changes. **Loss of Life:** The Chinese Civil War, coupled with the preceding conflict with Japan and the subsequent famines and political campaigns, led to the loss of tens of millions of lives. These demographic shocks affected generations of Chinese families. **Urbanization:** Despite initial efforts to emphasize rural development, the years following the Chinese Civil War eventually saw increased urbanization as the country industrialized. Migration to urban centers increased as people sought employment and a better quality of life, a trend that would accelerate in the decades to follow. # Conclusion The Chinese Civil War’s aftermath set the stage for radical transformations in China's economic, social, and demographic landscape. While it laid the groundwork for the establishment of a communist state aimed at creating a classless society, the policies and reforms implemented also led to unintended consequences, including economic difficulties and social upheavals. Over the decades, these transformations have deeply shaped the trajectory of China’s development, influencing not only its domestic affairs but its position on the world stage."},{"prompt":"conclusion of the chinese civil war on present china","completion":"The conclusion of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the retreat of the Kuomintang (KMT) to Taiwan, has exerted a profound and lasting impact on present-day China. Several aspects of contemporary China can be traced back to the outcomes and aftermath of the Civil War, shaping its political structure, economic policies, social fabric, and position in global affairs. # Political Implications The victory of the CPC solidified a one-party socialist state, which has remained unchallenged to the present day. The governance structure, ideological underpinnings, and political narrative of modern China are deeply rooted in the legacy of the revolution and the Civil War. The CPC's authority and legitimacy are often framed through the lens of its revolutionary heritage, emphasizing unity, stability, and continuation of the revolutionary goals. # Economic Transformations The socialist planned economy model initially adopted by the PRC, with significant industrial and agricultural reforms, laid the groundwork for future economic policies. While the early decades saw various economic experiments including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, the economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 marked a significant shift towards a market-oriented economy. Despite these transformations, the state retains significant control over the economy, a characteristic that can be traced back to centralizing impulses from the Civil War era. # Social and Cultural Impact The reshaping of Chinese society, with a focus on reducing inequalities, promoting gender equality, and eradicating feudal practices, has its roots in the post-Civil War reforms. Contemporary social policies continue to echo these themes, although modern challenges and the complexities of rapid urbanization and economic globalization have introduced new dynamics. The emphasis on national unity and the promotion of a cohesive national identity also draw upon narratives established during and after the Civil War. # Taiwan and Cross-Strait Relations The retreat of the KMT to Taiwan and the subsequent development of Taiwan as a separate political entity have led to ongoing complexities in cross-strait relations, which remain a central issue in China's foreign policy and national identity. The PRC's claim over Taiwan and the unresolved status of Taiwan in international law and relations are direct outcomes of the Chinese Civil War. # Global Positioning The conclusion of the Civil War and the establishment of the PRC also drastically altered China’s role in global politics. From its initial isolation in the early years of the Cold War to its eventual emergence as a major global power, China’s international policies, its role in global trade, its military posture, and its contributions to global governance are informed by its revolutionary legacy and the need to assert its sovereignty and development model. # Conclusion The conclusion of the Chinese Civil War has had an enduring impact on present-day China, defining its political structure, shaping its economic development, influencing its social policies, and affecting its relations with Taiwan and the wider world. As China continues to rise as a global power, the legacy of the Civil War remains a critical component of its national identity, domestic governance, and international strategy. The historical narratives and the revolutionary ideals that emerged from this period continue to be celebrated and serve as a source of legitimacy for the CPC, even as China navigates the challenges of the 21st century."},{"prompt":"Long term causes and short term causes of the chinese civil war","completion":"Long-term causes of the Chinese Civil War (1927-1950): 1. Nationalism: The Chinese people had a strong sense of national identity and a desire for independence from foreign influence, particularly from the Japanese and Western powers. 2. Weakness of the Qing Dynasty: The Qing Dynasty's failure to modernize and reform led to its eventual collapse in 1911, leaving a power vacuum that various factions sought to fill. 3. Political fragmentation: The Chinese government was divided among various warlords, political parties, and factions, leading to instability and constant power struggles. 4. Economic inequality: The unequal distribution of wealth and resources in China fueled social unrest and dissatisfaction with the ruling elite. 5. Foreign invasion and intervention: The Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s and continued Western interference in Chinese affairs further destabilized the country and fueled nationalist sentiments. Short-term causes of the Chinese Civil War: 1. The Northern Expedition: The Kuomintang (KMT) launched a military campaign in 1926 to reunify China under its rule. This campaign ultimately failed, leading to increased tensions between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 2. The Shanghai Massacre: In April 1927, the KMT launched a brutal crackdown on Communist Party members in Shanghai, leading to the deaths of thousands of Communists and marking a turning point in the relationship between the KMT and CCP. 3. The Xi'an Incident: In 1937, Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT, was kidnapped by his own generals, who demanded that he form a united front with the CCP to resist the Japanese invasion. This incident highlighted the growing divisions within the KMT and the need for a united front against the Japanese. 4. The Second United Front: In 1937, the KMT and CCP formed a tenuous alliance to fight against the Japanese invaders. However, this alliance quickly broke down after the end of World War II, leading to renewed hostilities between the two parties. 5. Struggle for power: Both the KMT and CCP sought to establish themselves as the legitimate ruling party in China, leading to intense power struggles and military conflicts throughout the country.

Due to space constraints, this will be more of a guide rather than a full implementation. Tic Tac Toe is a relatively simple game, so some features like quiescence search or aspiration windows might be overkill, as they are more applicable to complex games like chess. However, for educational purposes, let's touch on how you might start incorporating these concepts. # 1. Board Representation Module This module holds the state of the game, including the board and relevant game state information. \`\`\`python class GameState: def __init__(self): self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)] # 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board self.is_x_turn = True # X starts the game self.game_over = False self.winner = None def make_move(self, x, y): if self.is_move_valid(x, y): self.board[x][y] = 'X' if self.is_x_turn else 'O' self.is_x_turn = not self.is_x_turn self.check_game_over() def is_move_valid(self, x, y): return self.board[x][y] == ' ' def check_game_over(self): # Implement game over check and update self.game_over and self.winner pass \`\`\` # 2.

Методы машинного обучения предлагают эффективные инструменты для классификации и анализа данных трафика, используя различные подходы и алгоритмы. Основные методы можно разделить на три большие группы: обучение с учителем, обучение без учителя, и обучение с подкреплением. Рассмотрим каждый из них более подробно: # Обучение с учителем Это наиболее часто используемая категория методов для классификации типов контента. Обучение с учителем требует предварительно размеченных данных, где каждому образцу входящего трафика уже присвоен соответствующий класс/тип контента. - **Логистическая регрессия** - хорошо работает для бинарной классификации. - **Метод опорных векторов (SVM)** - эффективен для высокоразмерных данных. - **Решающие деревья** - легко интерпретируемы и могут быть использованы для классификации и регрессии. - **Случайные леса** - ансамблевый метод, использующий множество решающих деревьев для повышения точности и устойчивости. - **Градиентный бустинг** - последовательно строит и комбинирует множество слабых моделей (обычно решающих деревьев) для создания сильного классификатора. - **Нейронные сети** - особенно эффективны в сложных задачах классификации, таких как определение типа контента на изображениях или в аудио/видео трафике. # Обучение без учителя Методы обучения без учителя ищут шаблоны и закономерности в данных без использования предварительно размеченных классов или категорий. Эти техники хорошо подходят для идентификации новых, ранее неизвестных типов контента. - **Кластеризация** (например, K-means, иерархическая кластеризация) - группирует данные на основе их сходства, что может помочь в выделении различных типов контента. - **Принципиальный компонент анализ (PCA)** и другие методы уменьшения размерности - используются для выделения наиболее значимых признаков в данных, что может содействовать последующей кластеризации или классификации. # Обучение с подкреплением Этот подход подразумевает, что модель обучается путем взаимодействия со средой, стремясь максимизировать некую функцию вознаграждения за счет проб и ошибок. Хотя обучение с подкреплением не так часто применяется для классификации типов контента напрямую, оно может быть полезно для разработки алгоритмов, оптимизирующих процессы фильтрации или адаптации к изменяющемуся трафику. # Гибридные методы Существуют также гибридные подходы, сочетающие элементы различных методов машинного обучения. К примеру, можно использовать обучение без учителя для первичной кластеризации данных, а затем применить алгоритмы обучения с учителем для более точной классификации внутри каждой группы. Эти методы позволяют сочетать преимущества различных подходов для повышения общей точности и эффективности анализа. В заключение, выбор метода или комбинации методов машинного обучения для автоматизированного определения типа контента во входящем трафике зависит от множества факторов, включая характеристики данных, доступные вычислительные ресурсы и конкретные цели задачи."},{"prompt":"Теперь распиши подробный анализ плюсов и минусов этихм етодов","completion":"Давайте рассмотрим плюсы и минусы основных методов машинного обучения, применяемых для автоматизированного определения типа контента во входящем трафике. # Обучение с учителем **Плюсы:** - **Высокая точность и надёжность:** При наличии достаточного объема размеченных данных, методы обучения с учителем могут достигать высокой точности. - **Прямолинейная интерпретация:** Многие модели, особенно такие как решающие деревья, легко интерпретируемы, что позволяет понять логику принятия решений алгоритмом. - **Широкий спектр инструментов и алгоритмов:** Существует множество готовых решений и библиотек, поддерживающих различные методы обучения с учителем. **Минусы:** - **Нужда в большом количестве размеченных данных:** Для эффективного обучения требуются качественные и разнообразные данные, разметка которых может быть трудоёмкой или дорогостоящей. - **Переобучение:** Существует риск, что модель \\"запомнит\\" тренировочные данные и плохо будет работать на новых данных. Избегание переобучения требует внимательного подхода к проектированию модели. - **Чувствительность к шуму в данных:** Плохо очищенные или содержащие много ошибок датасеты могут значительно снизить эффективность моделей обучения с учителем. # Обучение без учителя **Плюсы:** - **Отсутствие необходимости в разметке данных:** Этот подход не требует предварительной разметки данных, что снижает затраты времени и ресурсов. - **Обнаружение неожиданных закономерностей:** Модели обучения без учителя способны выявлять скрытые структуры в данных, которые могли быть неочевидны при традиционных подходах. - **Гибкость:** Подход хорошо подходит для эксплоративного анализа данных и может быть использован в качестве предварительного этапа для дальнейшей точной классификации. **Минусы:** - **Сложность интерпретации:** Полученные результаты могут быть трудно интерпретируемы, особенно при больших объемах данных и сложных структурах. - **Зависимость от выбора параметров:** Эффективность многих алгоритмов обучения без учителя сильно зависит от выбранной модели и её параметров, оптимизация которых может быть неочевидной. # Обучение с подкреплением **Плюсы:** - **Адаптивность:** Модели способны адаптироваться к изменяющейся среде, что идеально подходит для динамических систем. - **Оптимизация долгосрочного поведения:** Фокус на максимизации суммарного вознаграждения позволяет алгоритмам оптимизировать долгосрочные стратегии действий. - **Эффективность в сложных средах:** Хорошо подходит для задач, где правила и цели могут быть сложными или не полностью известными заранее. **Минусы:** - **Сложность и вычислительные затраты:** Требуются значительные вычислительные ресурсы, особенно в сложных средах с большим количеством переменных. - **Риск непредсказуемого поведения:** Из-за фокуса на максимизации вознаграждения модели могут находить нежелательные способы достижения целей. - **Зависимость от функции вознаграждения:** Весь процесс обучения сильно зависит от того, насколько хорошо спроектирована функция вознаграждения, определение которой в реальных задачах может быть не тривиальным. При выборе метода стоит учитывать специфику задачи, доступные ресурсы, а также требуемую точность и интерпретируемость результатов. Во многих случаях сочетание нескольких подходов может дать лучшие результаты."},{"prompt":"Какая может быть актуальность для темы требования к методики автоматизированного определения типа контента во входящем трафике, связанная с Точность классификации Ресурсоемкость Присвоение доверия","completion":"Тема требований к методикам автоматизированного определения типа контента во входящем трафике, учитывая факторы такие, как точность классификации, ресурсоемкость и присвоение доверия, является крайне актуальной для современных IT-систем, в частности в областях информационной безопасности, анализа трафика и управления данными. Рассмотрим каждый из этих аспектов более подробно. # Точность классификации **Актуальность:** Способность системы точно классифицировать типы контента критична для многих приложений. Например, в контексте информационной безопасности необходимо точно определять вредоносный трафик для предотвращения атак. В области контент-фильтрации важно корректно определить неприемлемый или нежелательный контент. Системы рекомендаций зависят от точности классификации для предоставления пользователям соответствующего контента. **Вызовы:** Поддержание высокой точности классификации требует постоянного обновления и настройки моделей машинного обучения с учётом изменяющегося характера данных. # Ресурсоемкость **Актуальность:** Высокая ресурсоемкость может ограничивать возможности масштабирования систем и их применение в условиях ограниченных вычислительных ресурсов. Особенно это актуально для реального времени обработки больших объемов данных. В ситуациях, требующих быстрой обработки (например, в системах предотвращения вторжений), ресурсоемкость становится критическим фактором. **Вызовы:** Необходимо балансировать между сложностью моделей и требованиями к вычислительным ресурсам, чтобы обеспечить как высокую точность, так и эффективность обработки данных. # Присвоение доверия **Актуальность:** В контексте машинного обучения присвоение доверия связано с объяснимостью и прозрачностью решений, принятых системой. На основе чего система приняла то или иное решение? Этот вопрос становится ключевым в критических приложениях, где каждое решение может иметь серьезные последствия (например, в финансовой сфере, здравоохранении, правоохранительной системе). **Вызовы:** Создание моделей, которые не только точны и эффективны, но и позволяют понять логику принятия решений, является сложной задачей. Компромисс между \\"чёрными ящиками\\" высокой точности (напр. глубокие нейронные сети) и более простыми, но интерпретируемыми моделями (напр. решающие деревья) требует внимательного рассмотрения. В заключение, требования к методикам автоматизированного определения типа контента акцентируют внимание на необходимости создания баланса между точностью, эффективностью, интерпретируемостью и ресурсоемкостью. Преодоление этих вызовов требует комплексного подхода, включая выбор подходящих моделей и алгоритмов, а также разработку методик для их оптимизации и адаптации под специфику задачи и доступные ресурсы."},{"prompt":"# Massa-Veer-Demper ![massa-veer-demper.png](attachment:massa-veer-demper.png) Een blok met massa m = 30,text{kg} wordt onderworpen aan de harmonische kracht F = 90cos(6t),text{N}, waarbij t in seconden is.

Without specific rules provided for the transformation, we can only speculate on potential patterns or logic. Let's consider a common approach involving the position of letters in the alphabet: A = 1 N = 14 D = 4 One possible pattern involves adding or multiplying these values in a certain way, but since we immediately notice that none of the simple arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.) would directly lead us to 62 based on the values given, the encoding could involve more complex or multiple steps. However, in this case, without exact rules about how AND became 62, we can try to infer possibilities: 1. **Sum and Multiply:** If AND sums to 19 and results in 62 through some operation, it could involve an additional step we're not seeing. For example, adding a fixed number or multiplying by a certain factor not directly derivable from the information given. 2. **Pattern or Alphabet Value Manipulation:** The code could involve manipulating the alphabet values in a less straightforward way, such as squaring, cubing, or applying a specific formula where the positions of letters play a critical role. 3. **Arbitrary Code Assignment:** The code might not directly depend on the algebraic sum or product of the letter positions but could involve an arbitrary assignment or a more complex encoding algorithm. Given the potential complexities and the infinite range of encoding schemes, without more information or at least another example (besides AND = 62) to establish a pattern, we can't definitively solve for NAND. Taking a purely speculative approach and without a defined pattern, any number could be the code for NAND. Realistically, a more comprehensive explanation of the steps or rules used to encode \\"AND\\" as \\"62\\" is necessary to apply the same logic to another word like \\"NAND.\\" For a hypothetical guess without any logical backing due to the lack of information, the answer would be arbitrary. Accurate decoding requires specific patterns or rules from the original encoding process."},{"prompt":"Is the answer either 75 or 79 or 33 or none","completion":"Given the options 75, 79, 33, or none and the original statement that \\"AND\\" equals 62, let's try to guess logically, despite the lack of a clear method from the initial information provided. If \\"AND\\" equals 62, without a clear logic or method provided, guessing the code for \\"NAND\\" based on the options 75, 79, 33, or none is speculative. However, if we were to assume an additive principle based on the positions in the alphabet (A=1, N=14, D=4) and try to guess a pattern, we could hypothesize: \\"A + N + D\\" (1+14+4) did not mathematically equal 62 through simple addition (which equals 19), suggesting a more complex pattern. Given this complexity without a straightforward arithmetic relationship, accurately predicting the code for \\"NAND\\" specifically aiming for one of the provided choices is challenging. If we were working with a simple addition and then applying an undefined operation to get from 19 to 62, it's not transparent how adding another \\"N\\" (14) to the equation would directly translate to any of the provided options (75, 79, 33) unless we have a specific formula or pattern applied to \\"AND\\" that we could similarly apply to \\"NAND\\". Given the speculative nature and unless there was a missed pattern or specific operation that was previously outlined and not observed, none of those numbers distinctly stand out as the logical outcome based on the information provided. The logical step between \\"AND = 62\\" to \\"NAND equals X\\" is not clear under standard arithmetic or common encoding strategies without additional rules or patterns to apply. Therefore, without more explicit rules or a clear pattern to follow, we cannot confidently assert that the correct answer is among 75, 79, 33, or none—they are purely speculative guesses in the context of the information provided. Realistically, **none** could be the correct choice if all options were intended to be guiding towards a logical deduction that simply isn't possible with the given data. Alternatively, one of the numbers provided might be correct if there was an overlooked rule or pattern applicable that we haven't been able to deduce with the given information."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: ПриветASSISTANT: Привет!

В контексте личности и социальных взаимодействий, термин “ориентация” может относиться к различным аспектам, таким как сексуальная ориентация, профессиональная ориентация или жизненные приоритеты и ценности.<br/><br/>Сексуальная ориентация описывает, к какому полу или полам чувствует привлечение человек. Это может включать гетеросексуальность, гомосексуальность, бисексуальность, асексуальность и другие формы ориентации.<br/><br/>Профессиональная ориентация относится к тому, как человек определяет свои интересы, силы и предпочтения в выборе профессии или карьерного пути. Это может включать склонность к определенным видам деятельности, таким как наука, искусство, технологии, преподавание и т. д.<br/><br/>Ориентация в жизненных ценностях и приоритетах указывает на то, что является важным для человека в его жизни, его цели, стремления и то, какие аспекты жизни он считает приоритетными (например, семья, карьера, личностное развитие).<br/><br/>Пожалуйста, уточните, о какой конкретно ориентации вы хотели бы узнать подробнее.USER: Раскажи про ЛГБТ и про сексуальные орентацииASSISTANT: ЛГБТ – это аббревиатура, обозначающая лесбиянок, геев, бисексуалов и трансгендерных людей. Этот термин служит для обозначения сообщества, члены которого имеют различные сексуальные ориентации и гендерные идентичности, отличные от традиционных гетеросексуальных норм и гендерных ролей.<br/><br/>Сексуальная ориентация – это длительное эмоциональное, романтическое, сексуальное или глубокое личное привлечение к другим лицам. Сексуальная ориентация может быть различной:<br/><br/>- Гетеросексуальность: привлечение к лицам противоположного пола.<br/>- Гомосексуальность (часто называемая также “лесбийской” для женщин и “гейской” для мужчин): привлечение к лицам того же пола.<br/>- Бисексуальность: привлечение к лицам как своего, так и противоположного пола.<br/>- Асексуальность: отсутствие сексуального привлечения к людям любого пола, хотя асексуалы могут испытывать романтическое привлечение.<br/>- Пансексуальность: привлечение к людям независимо от их пола или гендерной идентичности.<br/>- Демисексуальность: сексуальное привлечение возникает только после того, как выстроены глубокие эмоциональные связи.<br/><br/>Гендерная идентичность относится к личному восприятию гендера, которое может соответствовать или не соответствовать гендеру, присвоенному при рождении. Трансгендерные люди – это те, чьи гендерные идентичности отличаются от гендера, присвоенного им при рождении.<br/><br/>В последние годы осведомленность и признание прав ЛГБТ-сообщества значительно увеличились во многих странах мира, хотя в некоторых местах члены ЛГБТ-сообщества все еще сталкиваются с дискриминацией и непониманием. Борьба ЛГБТ за равные права - это часть более широкого движения за права человека, направленного на обеспечение равенства, признания и защиты прав всех людей, независимо от их сексуальной ориентации или гендерной идентичности.USER: Найди групы лгбтASSISTANT: Я не могу предоставлять информацию о конкретных ЛГБТ-сообществах, группах или организациях, поскольку мои возможности ограничены и могут быть неактуальными.

Пока!USER: Расскажите про фамильяровASSISTANT:","completion":"Фамильяры в магическом и фолклорном контексте - это духи или магические существа, которые служат ведьмам, волшебникам или колдунам, обычно в животной форме. Они считаются защитниками, помощниками в магических ритуалах или даже источниками магической силы и знаний. Согласно многим преданиям и сказаниям, фамильяры могут принимать различные формы – от обычных животных, таких как кошки, вороны, совы, крысы, до более мистических существ, например, маленьких драконов или гоблинов. Они часто ассоциируются с европейскими ведовскими традициями, но концепция помощников или спутников в магии встречается в различных культурах по всему миру. В истории охоты на ведьм в Средние века и во времена раннего Нового времени, вера в фамильяров играла ключевую роль. Обвиняемые в колдовстве могли быть обвинены в том, что они имеют животных-фамильяров, которые помогают им в их колдовских делах или действуют как связь между ведьмой и дьяволом. В современной поп-культуре и литературе о фэнтези концепция фамильяров также очень популярна. Они часто изображаются как верные спутники волшебников и ведьм, имеющие как мистические, так и защитные функции. Примеры из современных фэнтези и аниме, где встречаются фамильяры, включают \\"Гарри Поттер\\", \\"Сабрина – маленькая ведьма\\", \\"Чернокнижник из Блэквуда\\", \\"Natsume's Book of Friends\\" и многие другие.

Documentation: Ensure that all aspects of the DR plan, including procedures, contact information, and recovery strategies, are well-documented and easily accessible to all relevant stakeholders. 2. Training: Regularly conduct training sessions and drills to familiarize key personnel with their roles and responsibilities during a disaster. This helps ensure a smooth and effective response when a real incident occurs. 3. Communication: Establish clear communication channels and protocols for disseminating critical information to employees, stakeholders, and external partners during a disaster situation. 4. Testing: Regularly test the DR plan through mock exercises, tabletop simulations, and full-scale drills to identify and address any potential gaps or shortcomings in the plan. 5. Resource allocation: Ensure that necessary resources, such as backup systems, data backups, and recovery equipment, are in place and readily accessible in the event of a disaster. 6. Continuous improvement: Continuously review and update the DR plan based on lessons learned from past incidents, changes in technology, and evolving business requirements.

Las principales fuerzas que necesitamos considerar son: 1. **La fuerza de gravedad** ((F_g)) paralela a la pendiente, que intenta bajar el robot. Esta fuerza se calcula como (m cdot g cdot sin(theta)), donde (m) es la masa del robot, (g) es la aceleración de la gravedad ((9.8 m/s^2)), y (theta) es el ángulo de la pendiente. 2. **La fuerza de fricción** ((F_f)), que también ayudará a prevenir el deslizamiento del robot hacia abajo. La fuerza de fricción en una pendiente se calcula con (F_f = mu cdot N), donde (mu) es el coeficiente de fricción y (N) es la fuerza normal, que en una pendiente es (m cdot g cdot cos(theta)). Sin embargo, como se nos pide calcular el ángulo máximo en el que el robot puede subir a una velocidad constante, necesitamos trabajar con la potencia de los motores y cómo esta se relaciona con la fuerza necesaria para mover el robot hacia arriba a dicha velocidad constante y con la eficiencia del robot. La potencia ((P)) necesaria para mover el robot hacia arriba a una velocidad constante ((v)) se determina por la fuerza total necesaria en dirección de la pendiente ((F_{total})) multiplicada por la velocidad ((v)), es decir, (P = F_{total} cdot v). Dado que la eficiencia ((eta)) es 1, toda la potencia eléctrica se convierte en potencia mecánica. La potencia total de los motores es (P_{total} = 2 cdot 1.2W = 2.4W). Entonces, tenemos: [P_{total} = F_{total} cdot v] Donde (F_{total} = m cdot g cdot sin(theta) + mu cdot m cdot g cdot cos(theta)). Substituyendo (P_{total}) y reordenando para encontrar (theta): [2.4 = (8 cdot 9.8 cdot sin(theta) + 0.5 cdot 8 cdot 9.8 cdot cos(theta)) cdot 0.3] [2.4 = (78.4 cdot sin(theta) + 39.2 cdot cos(theta)) cdot 0.3] Dividiendo ambos lados por (0.3): [8 = 78.4 cdot sin(theta) + 39.2 cdot cos(theta)] [8 = 39.2 cdot (2 cdot sin(theta) + cos(theta))] Dividiendo ambos lados por (39.2): [0.2041 = 2 cdot sin(theta) + cos(theta)] Esta ecuación relaciona directamente el ángulo (theta) con las condiciones dadas, pero resolver para (theta) directamente a partir de esta combinación de seno y coseno puede no ser inmediato. Preferimos aplicar identidades trigonométricas o métodos numéricos para encontrar el valor exacto de (theta). Sin embargo, directamente no tenemos una forma sencilla de descomponer la ecuación sin referenciar a una metodología específica para resolver esta clase de ecuaciones trigonométricas no lineales, normalmente requeriríamos de uso de software matemático o aplicaciones de cálculo numérico para obtener (theta) de manera precisa. En la práctica, este problema puede ser un poco complicado de resolver directamente sin simplificaciones adicionales o sin conocer técnicas específicas de solución, lo que podría implicar iterar sobre valores posibles de (theta) hasta encontrar uno que satisfaga la ecuación con un error mínimo aceptable."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"我要获取优惠","completion":"要获取优惠，通常有几个策略可以尝试： 1. **注册新用户优惠**：很多网站和应用为了吸引新用户，会提供给首次注册的用户特别的优惠或者折扣。 2. **节日和特殊日优惠**：在特定的节日或者纪念日，许多商家会提供限时优惠或者促销活动，比如黑色星期五、双11、圣诞节等。 3. **关注社媒**：许多品牌会在他们的社交媒体上发布优惠信息，如折扣码或者限时打折，所以关注你感兴趣的品牌的社交媒体账号是一个不错的方法。 4. **订阅电子邮件**：通过订阅商家的官方电子邮件列表，你可以收到最新的促销活动和独家折扣信息。 5. **使用优惠码和折扣网站**：有许多网站和应用专门提供各种优惠券和折扣代码，如RetailMeNot、Honey等。 6. **组团购买/团购网站**：通过组团购买可以获得更优惠的价格，一些团购网站如Groupon，也提供各类商品和服务的折扣。 7. **比价工具**：使用比价工具或者网站（如Google Shopping或PriceGrabber）来找出某物品的最低价格，有时也可以发现意外的优惠。 记得在获取和使用优惠时阅读优惠的具体条款和条件，确保它们适用于你想要购买的商品或服务。希望这些建议对你有帮助！"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Below is an example of how you might structure the component description for \\"Headings\\" to emphasize their importance and to provide best practices for creating descriptive headings: --- # Component: Headings **Component Description:** Headings are used to organize and structure content on web pages, making it easier for readers to navigate and understand the content hierarchy. They are pivotal in accessibility, providing a means for screen reader users to efficiently skim through a page by listening to the list of headings and selecting a section of interest to read in detail. **Importance of Headings:** 1. **Structure and Navigation:** Headings create a content outline, enabling users to comprehend how the information is organized. For users of assistive technology, headings are the primary means of navigation, allowing them to jump between different sections without having to traverse the entire content linearly. 2. **SEO Benefits:** Proper use of headings can also contribute to SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Search engines use headings to index the structure and content of web pages, with higher-level headings (H1, H2) being considered more significant, thus contributing to the page's ranking. 3. **Visual Appeal:** Visually, headings break up text, making it more appealing and readable. They guide the reader's eye and highlight key sections, improving overall engagement with the content. **Best Practices for Descriptive Headings:** - **Logical Structure:** Use headings sequentially starting with H1, which should be reserved for the main title of the page, followed by H2 for main sections, and H3, H4, etc., for sub-sections. Avoid skipping heading levels as this disrupts the document’s structure and confuses both users and search engines. - **Be Descriptive:** Make headings informative and descriptive. They should give users clarity about the content that follows. Avoid vague headings; instead, use keywords that reflect the essence of the subsequent content. - **Limit Length:** While being descriptive, headings should also be succinct to remain effective. Aim for brevity to ensure headings are impactful and easy to scan. - **Unique Headings:** Ensure that each heading is unique on the page, facilitating clear differentiation between sections for all users, especially for those using screen readers. - **Heading Style:** While HTML elements define the structural importance of headings, CSS should be used for styling. This ensures that the appearance of headings can be customized without compromising the document structure. - **Avoid Using Headings for Styling Purposes:** Do not use heading tags simply to render text more prominently. Headings are primarily for structuring content. Use CSS for styling text without altering its semantic meaning or importance. **Accessibility Considerations:** When creating headings, always consider users who navigate content with the help of screen readers or keyboard navigation. Ensure that headings are implemented in a way that screen readers can accurately interpret and convey the structure of the content to users. - **Use Landmarks:** To further enhance navigation, use landmarks (e.g., \`<nav>\`, \`<main>\`, \`<aside>\`, \`<footer>\`) in conjunction with headings to define the page layout semantically. **Conclusion:** Descriptive headings are not just about enhancing readability; they are a cornerstone of accessible content design. By following these best practices, content authors can ensure that their content is organized, accessible, and engaging for all users, regardless of how they interact with the content. --- Incorporating this section into your Content Authoring Handbook will guide authors in creating more accessible and SEO-friendly content, emphasizing the importance of structure, semantics, and user experience in web content creation."},{"prompt":"No, i want details for what is descriptive headings","completion":"Certainly! Let's dive into the specifics of what descriptive headings are and their critical role in content structuring and accessibility. **Descriptive Headings: An Overview** Descriptive headings are succinct titles that provide a clear and concise summary of the content that follows. They serve as signposts for readers, guiding them through the text and helping them to easily understand the structure and main points of a document or webpage. In the context of web accessibility and usability, descriptive headings are especially important because they allow all users, including those using assistive technologies like screen readers, to navigate and comprehend content more effectively. # Why Descriptive Headings Matter 1. **Enhanced Readability and Navigation:** Descriptive headings break down content into manageable sections, making it easier for users to scan through a page and find the information they need without having to read every word. 2. **Accessibility:** For users of screen readers, descriptive headings are crucial. They allow these users to navigate content in a non-linear fashion, jumping from one section to another based on their interests or needs. This is particularly helpful for people with visual impairments or reading disorders, as it provides them with a means to understand the overall layout and key points of the content without seeing how it is visually organized. 3. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Search engines use headings to index the structure and content of web pages. Descriptive headings that contain relevant keywords can improve a page's search ranking, making it more visible and accessible to users searching for that information. # Characteristics of Effective Descriptive Headings - **Clarity:** They clearly indicate what the following section is about, using terminology familiar to the reader. - **Brevity:** They are concise, avoiding unnecessary words or jargon, making them easy to scan. - **Relevance:** They are directly relevant to the content that follows, accurately summarizing the section's topic or main idea. - **Distinctiveness:** Each heading on a page is distinct, providing unique information about its respective section, helping users differentiate between sections. - **Structured Correctly:** Adhering to hierarchical order, starting with an H1 tag for the main title, followed by H2 for main sections, and H3, H4, etc., for sub-sections. This hierarchy helps convey the relative importance and organization of the content. # Examples - **Non-Descriptive Heading:** \\"Considerations\\" - **Descriptive Heading:** \\"Key Factors for Choosing an Accessibility-Friendly CMS\\" - **Non-Descriptive Heading:** \\"Introduction\\" - **Descriptive Heading:** \\"The Impact of Climate Change on Coral Reefs\\" The second examples in both cases give readers (and search engines) a clear idea of what to expect in the content that follows, enhancing understanding and navigation. # Implementing Descriptive Headings When creating content, start with a rough outline that includes potential headings. This can help ensure that your overall structure is logical and that each section's heading accurately reflects its content. After drafting your content, revisit your headings to ensure they remain descriptive of the content they precede and adjust as necessary to enhance clarity and navigation. **Conclusion:** Descriptive headings are a vital component of content creation that facilitates better user experience, navigation, and accessibility. By making headings clear, concise, and relevant, content authors can significantly improve the understandability and findability of their information, both for users and search engines alike."},{"prompt":"What is heading hierarchy, i need description","completion":"Heading hierarchy refers to the structured organization and sequencing of heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) in web content and documents. It mirrors the logical flow and division of content, much like the outline of a book or report that organizes information into a coherent structure of main topics and subtopics. This hierarchical arrangement plays a critical role in web accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and enhancing the overall readability and navigability of content for all users. # Understanding Heading Hierarchy In HTML, heading tags range from \`<h1>\` to \`<h6>\`, with \`<h1>\` being the highest (or most important) level and \`<h6>\` the lowest. Each level of heading tag serves a specific purpose in defining the structure and importance of content sections: - **\`<h1>\` Tags:** Represent the main title of the page, akin to a book's title. There should be only one \`<h1>\` tag per page to signify the page's primary focus and topic. It is the cornerstone of the document's structure, providing a clear entry point for both users and search engines. - **\`<h2>\` to \`<h6>\` Tags:** Serve as subheadings, creating a nested structure of content that cascades from the primary topic. These tags break down the main subject into subsections, detailing topics and subtopics in a way that introduces a clear, ordered flow to the information. # Importance of a Proper Heading Hierarchy 1. **Accessibility:** Heading hierarchy significantly aids users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers, by providing them with an overview of the page's content through the headings alone. Users can jump between headings, allowing them to access the information they are most interested in more efficiently. 2. **Usability:** It improves the readability and navigability of content, enabling all users to scan through a document easily and identify sections of interest. A logical heading structure guides users through the content, enhancing their understanding and retention of the information. 3. **SEO:** Search engines use heading tags to index the structure and content of web pages. A clear and logical heading hierarchy helps search engines better understand the content, which can influence a page's ranking in search results. Headings that accurately describe the section's content and incorporate relevant keywords can boost SEO performance. # Implementing Heading Hierarchy - **Start with a Single \`<h1>\` Tag:** Begin with an \`<h1>\` tag that encapsulates the main theme or topic of the page. It's critical for orienting users and search engines to the content's subject matter. - **Sequentially Use Heading Tags:** Follow the \`<h1>\` tag with \`<h2>\` tags for major section titles. Use \`<h3>\` tags for subsections within those major sections, and continue down to \`<h4>\`, \`<h5>\`, and \`<h6>\` tags as needed for further sub-levels. - **Maintain Logical Structure:** Ensure that heading tags are used in order and do not skip levels abruptly (e.g., jumping from an \`<h2>\` directly to an \`<h5>\`), as this can confuse users and disrupt the content's flow. - **Be Consistent:** Apply the same heading hierarchy principles throughout your entire website or document to maintain consistency and predictability for users. # Conclusion Heading hierarchy is an essential element of content structure, crucial for making web content accessible, usable, and comprehensible for all users, including those with disabilities. By implementing a logical and consistent heading hierarchy, content creators and web developers can significantly enhance user experience, accessibility, and SEO performance, ensuring their content is organized, engaging, and easily navigable."},{"prompt":"i need details in 1 paragraph","completion":"Heading hierarchy is a fundamental organizational principle used in web content and documents, employing a systematic arrangement of heading tags (H1 through H6) to structure information logically and sequentially from the most to the least important.

Tables are used to organize and display detailed information in a compact and logical format, facilitating comparison, understanding relationships, and identifying patterns in data. In HTML, tables are created using the \`<table>\` element, with rows defined by \`<tr>\` tags, columns by \`<th>\` (table header) or \`<td>\` (table data) tags, and can include captions provided by the \`<caption>\` element for added context. # Examples of Tables: 1. **Product Comparison Table:** This type of table lists products side by side, allowing users to compare features, prices, ratings, and other attributes to make informed decisions. | Product | Price | Features | Rating | |-----------|-------|-----------------|--------| | Product A | 50 | Feature 1, 2, 3 | ★★★★☆ | | Product B | 60 | Feature 1, 4, 5 | ★★★☆☆ | | Product C | 55 | Feature 2, 3, 6 | ★★★★★ | 2. **Schedule or Timetable:** A timetable for classes, transport schedules, or event agendas, displaying times and corresponding activities or destinations. | Time | Activity | |-----------|--------------------| | 08:00 AM | Breakfast | | 09:00 AM | Keynote Speech | | 11:00 AM | Workshop Session 1 | | 01:00 PM | Lunch | 3. **Financial Statements:** Used in business and finance to present financial performance, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements in a period. | Account | Debit() | Credit() | |-------------------|----------|-----------| | Cash | 5,000 | | | Accounts Receivable | | 2,000 | | Sales Revenue | | 7,000 | | Rent Expense | 1,000 | | 4. **Sports League Standings:** Displays teams in a sports league along with their played matches, wins, losses, draws, and total points for the season. | Team | Played | Wins | Draws | Losses | Points | |------------|--------|------|-------|--------|--------| | Team A | 10 | 7 | 2 | 1 | 23 | | Team B | 10 | 6 | 3 | 1 | 21 | | Team C | 10 | 5 | 5 | 0 | 20 | 5. **Educational Grades Overview:** Summarizes student performance, listing subjects taken and the corresponding grades achieved within a semester or term. | Subject | Grade | |-------------------|-------| | Mathematics | A | | Science | B+ | | Literature | A- | | Physical Education| B | Each example showcases how tables can effectively organize and present data across different contexts, making them indispensable for web pages, documents, and applications that require structured data presentation."},{"prompt":"What is list? Also what is ordered list and un ordered list","completion":"A list in web content and document formatting is a collection of items presented sequentially or thematically. It serves to organize information in an easily consumable manner, making content easier to scan and understand for readers. Lists are fundamental in web development and document design, providing a structure for grouping related pieces of information together. # Ordered List: An ordered list is a list where each item in the list is numbered, indicating a specific sequence or hierarchy. Ordered lists are used when the order of the listed items is important, such as steps in instructions, rankings, or a series of related events. In HTML, an ordered list is created with the \`<ol>\` element, and each item within the list is marked up with the \`<li>\` (list item) element. The default behavior is for items to be numbered sequentially, but the styling can be modified with CSS or list attributes to display different numeral styles such as alphabetical (a, b, c), Roman numerals (i, ii, iii), and so on. **Example of an Ordered List:** 1. Wake up. 2. Brush teeth. 3. Have breakfast. # Unordered List: An unordered list, on the other hand, is a list in which the sequence of items is not important. The items in an unordered list are typically marked with bullets. This type of list is suitable for presenting a collection of items without inherent order, such as ingredients in a recipe, features of a product, or general categories of topics. In HTML, an unordered list is created using the \`<ul>\` element, with \`<li>\` elements nested inside to represent each item. **Example of an Unordered List:** - Apples - Bananas - Oranges # HTML Code Examples: **Ordered List in HTML:** \`\`\`html <ol> <li>Wake up.</li> <li>Brush teeth.</li> <li>Have breakfast.</li> </ol> \`\`\` **Unordered List in HTML:** \`\`\`html <ul> <li>Apples</li> <li>Bananas</li> <li>Oranges</li> </ul> \`\`\` In summary, lists are essential for organizing and presenting information in a structured manner on the web. Ordered lists (\`<ol>\`) showcase items with a clear sequence, while unordered lists (\`<ul>\`) group items without any prioritization or order, and both use the \`<li>\` tag to denote individual items within the lists."},{"prompt":"What is Reading Order Bad Example for Reading Order: Good Example for Reading Order:","completion":"# What is Reading Order? Reading order refers to the sequence in which text, images, and other elements are intended to be viewed or read on a page. It's crucial for understanding and comprehensibility, especially in digital environments like websites and PDFs, where the visual arrangement guides the user through the content. For individuals using assistive technologies, such as screen readers, the reading order is determined by the underlying code structure rather than the visual layout. Ensuring a logical reading order is essential for accessibility, as it allows users with visual impairments or those who rely on keyboard navigation to perceive the information in the sequence intended by the author. # Bad Example for Reading Order: Imagine a webpage designed to look visually appealing but without regard to the HTML structure's logical sequence. Visually, the content seems to flow from a welcome message, to a news update section, followed by contact information. However, if the HTML markup places the news update at the top of the code, followed by the contact information, and then the welcome message, screen readers and keyboard navigation tools will present the information in this jumbled order. This disconnect creates confusion for users relying on assistive technologies, as the sequence in which information is presented doesn't make logical sense. - **Visually Presented Order:** 1. Welcome Message 2. News Update 3. Contact Information - **Actual Reading Order (as coded):** 1. News Update 2. Contact Information 3. Welcome Message # Good Example for Reading Order: A website where the HTML structure matches the visual presentation. The code is written so that a screen reader or keyboard navigation will encounter the elements in the same order a sighted person would, moving from the welcome message, to the news update section, and finally, to the contact information. This consistency ensures that all users, regardless of how they access the content, receive the information in a coherent and logical sequence. - **Visual and Code-Based Order:** 1.

Jika Anda mengacu pada memiliki perasaan suka atau ketertarikan kepada seseorang yang memiliki posisi atau status tertentu, seperti seorang guru, dosen, atau kepala sekolah (yang mungkin Anda maksud dengan \\"sppu\\"), ada beberapa hal yang perlu dipertimbangkan. Di banyak tempat, hubungan antara siswa dan guru atau antara mahasiswa dan dosen diatur oleh aturan etika dan profesionalisme yang ketat. Hal ini untuk menjaga integritas lingkungan pendidikan dan untuk melindungi semua pihak dari potensi konflik kepentingan atau eksploitasi. 1. **Etika dan Profesionalisme:** Hubungan antara guru dan siswa ataupun dosen dan mahasiswa harus didasarkan pada profesionalisme. Perasaan pribadi seperti ketertarikan harus dipisahkan dari hubungan profesional ini. 2. **Keseimbangan Kekuasaan:** Seorang guru atau dosen memegang posisi kekuasaan atas siswa atau mahasiswa, yang dapat menciptakan dinamika yang tidak seimbang jika ada hubungan pribadi di luar konteks pendidikan. 3. **Aturan dan Kebijakan:** Banyak lembaga pendidikan memiliki aturan yang jelas mengenai apa yang diperbolehkan dan apa yang tidak dalam hal hubungan antar anggota komunitasnya, termasuk larangan hubungan asmara antara guru/dosen dengan siswa/mahasiswa. 4. **Konsekuensi:** Jika ada kebijakan yang melarang hubungan semacam ini, melanggarnya bisa berujung pada konsekuensi serius bagi guru atau dosen, termasuk kemungkinan kehilangan pekerjaan atau reputasi profesional.

However, reports and analyses often highlight areas within the North, parts of the Midlands, and some coastal areas as facing significant economic challenges. One frequently cited report, the Indices of Deprivation, which is published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, provides a comprehensive overview of various dimensions of deprivation, including income, employment, health, education, crime, the living environment, and access to housing and services. It is used to identify the areas that are most disadvantaged or deprived. Historically, certain areas within counties such as Cornwall, parts of the North East (like County Durham or Tyne and Wear), and areas within the West Midlands have shown higher levels of deprivation. It is important to note, though, that within every county there can be significant variation, with pockets of both wealth and poverty. The Indices of Deprivation often focuses on smaller areas than entire counties, such as Local Authority districts or wards, to capture more detailed disparities. For the most precise and updated identification of the poorest areas or counties in England, it's recommended to consult the latest version of the Indices of Deprivation or other up-to-date government or research reports."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Three of the clauses in the treaty of versailles were; -The reduction of Germanys military - Loss of german land- War guilt clause answer this as a grade 9 gcse essay answer","completion":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, was met with widespread disapproval from the German people. Many Germans felt that the clauses of the treaty were unfair and unjust, leading to a deep sense of resentment and anger towards the Allied powers. One of the key grievances that the Germans had with the Treaty of Versailles was the reduction of Germany's military. The treaty imposed strict limitations on the size and capabilities of the German army, navy, and air force. This was seen as a significant blow to Germany's national pride and security, as the country felt vulnerable and exposed to potential threats from neighboring powers. Furthermore, the loss of German land was another major point of contention for the German people. The treaty stripped Germany of significant territories, including Alsace-Lorraine, the Saar Basin, and parts of West Prussia. This loss of land was seen as a humiliation and a betrayal by the German people, as it eroded the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Additionally, the war guilt clause included in the Treaty of Versailles further fueled the resentment and bitterness felt by the German population. The clause placed sole responsibility for the outbreak of World War I on Germany and its allies, despite the complex web of alliances and actions that led to the conflict. This was perceived as a grave injustice by the German people, who believed that they were unfairly scapegoated and punished for the sins of all involved in the war. In conclusion, the Treaty of Versailles was deeply unpopular among the German people, who saw it as a harsh and unjust punishment imposed by the victorious Allied powers. The reduction of Germany's military, loss of land, and war guilt clause were particularly galling to the German population, leading to a sense of national humiliation and resentment that would shape German politics and society for years to come."},{"prompt":"The treaty of versailles was hated by most Germans who disagreed with the clauses.

There were several key clauses in the treaty that fueled the discontent among the German population. Three of the most controversial clauses were the reduction of Germany's military, the loss of German land, and the war guilt clause. Firstly, the reduction of Germany's military was a significant blow to German national pride and security. The treaty imposed strict limitations on the size and capabilities of the German army, navy, and air force. This drastic reduction in military strength was seen as a humiliating disarmament that left Germany vulnerable to potential threats from neighboring powers. Many Germans resented this clause, feeling that it unjustly punished their country and left them defenseless. Secondly, the loss of German land was another contentious issue in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany was stripped of significant territories, including Alsace-Lorraine, the Saar Basin, and parts of West Prussia. The loss of these lands was viewed as a severe blow to Germany's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Many Germans felt a deep sense of betrayal and anger over the forced surrender of these territories, which they considered to be an unjust punishment imposed by the victorious Allied powers. Furthermore, the war guilt clause in the Treaty of Versailles placed sole responsibility for the outbreak of World War I on Germany and its allies. This clause was particularly infuriating to the German population, as it was perceived as a grossly unfair and unjust accusation. Germans believed that the blame for the war should be shared among all parties involved, rather than being laid solely at Germany's feet. The war guilt clause fed into the narrative of German victimhood and contributed to the sense of resentment and bitterness towards the treaty. In conclusion, the Treaty of Versailles was largely despised by the German people due to the harsh and punitive clauses it contained. The reduction of Germany's military, loss of German land, and war guilt clause were among the key factors that fueled the resentment and anger towards the treaty. These clauses were viewed as unjust and humiliating impositions that inflicted lasting wounds on the German national psyche. The sense of betrayal and injustice stemming from the treaty would play a significant role in shaping German politics and society in the years to come."},{"prompt":"i have following code to read my csv file which is a 27GB size file import pandas as pd # Load the dataset using pandas df = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\") and im getting following error: { \\"name\\": \\"MemoryError\\", \\"message\\": \\"Unable to allocate 13.7 GiB for an array with shape (6317, 290138) and data type float64\\", \\"stack\\": \\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- MemoryError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[1], line 3 1 import pandas as pd 2 # Load the dataset using pandas ----> 3 df = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\") File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandasioparsersreaders.py:1026, in read_csv(filepath_or_buffer, sep, delimiter, header, names, index_col, usecols, dtype, engine, converters, true_values, false_values, skipinitialspace, skiprows, skipfooter, nrows, na_values, keep_default_na, na_filter, verbose, skip_blank_lines, parse_dates, infer_datetime_format, keep_date_col, date_parser, date_format, dayfirst, cache_dates, iterator, chunksize, compression, thousands, decimal, lineterminator, quotechar, quoting, doublequote, escapechar, comment, encoding, encoding_errors, dialect, on_bad_lines, delim_whitespace, low_memory, memory_map, float_precision, storage_options, dtype_backend) 1013 kwds_defaults = _refine_defaults_read( 1014 dialect, 1015 delimiter, (...) 1022 dtype_backend=dtype_backend, 1023 ) 1024 kwds.update(kwds_defaults) -> 1026 return _read(filepath_or_buffer, kwds) File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandasioparsersreaders.py:626, in _read(filepath_or_buffer, kwds) 623 return parser 625 with parser: --> 626 return parser.read(nrows) File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandasioparsersreaders.py:1968, in TextFileReader.read(self, nrows) 1965 else: 1966 new_col_dict = col_dict -> 1968 df = DataFrame( 1969 new_col_dict, 1970 columns=columns, 1971 index=index, 1972 copy=not using_copy_on_write(), 1973 ) 1975 self._currow += new_rows 1976 return df File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreframe.py:778, in DataFrame.__init__(self, data, index, columns, dtype, copy) 772 mgr = self._init_mgr( 773 data, axes={\\"index\\": index, \\"columns\\": columns}, dtype=dtype, copy=copy 774 ) 776 elif isinstance(data, dict): 777 # GH#38939 de facto copy defaults to False only in non-dict cases --> 778 mgr = dict_to_mgr(data, index, columns, dtype=dtype, copy=copy, typ=manager) 779 elif isinstance(data, ma.MaskedArray): 780 from numpy.ma import mrecords File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreinternalsconstruction.py:503, in dict_to_mgr(data, index, columns, dtype, typ, copy) 499 else: 500 # dtype check to exclude e.g. range objects, scalars 501 arrays = [x.copy() if hasattr(x, \\"dtype\\") else x for x in arrays] --> 503 return arrays_to_mgr(arrays, columns, index, dtype=dtype, typ=typ, consolidate=copy) File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreinternalsconstruction.py:152, in arrays_to_mgr(arrays, columns, index, dtype, verify_integrity, typ, consolidate) 149 axes = [columns, index] 151 if typ == \\"block\\": --> 152 return create_block_manager_from_column_arrays( 153 arrays, axes, consolidate=consolidate, refs=refs 154 ) 155 elif typ == \\"array\\": 156 return ArrayManager(arrays, [index, columns]) File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreinternalsmanagers.py:2144, in create_block_manager_from_column_arrays(arrays, axes, consolidate, refs) 2142 raise_construction_error(len(arrays), arrays[0].shape, axes, e) 2143 if consolidate: -> 2144 mgr._consolidate_inplace() 2145 return mgr File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreinternalsmanagers.py:1788, in BlockManager._consolidate_inplace(self) 1782 def _consolidate_inplace(self) -> None: 1783 # In general, _consolidate_inplace should only be called via 1784 # DataFrame._consolidate_inplace, otherwise we will fail to invalidate 1785 # the DataFrame's _item_cache.

A 27GB file is substantial, and depending on the contents and structure of your CSV, the memory required to hold it in a DataFrame can easily exceed your system's capabilities, especially once you factor in the overhead of Python objects. To work with such large datasets, you have a few options: # 1. Use \`chunksize\` Parameter Pandas allows you to read a CSV file in chunks of manageable size. This approach lets you process the file piece by piece. \`\`\`python chunk_size = 10 ** 6 # Number of rows per chunk. Adjust based on your system's memory. chunks = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\", chunksize=chunk_size) for chunk in chunks: # Process each chunk here # Example: print the size of each chunk print(chunk.shape) \`\`\` # 2. Use Dask [Dask](https://dask.org/) is a parallel computing Python library that scales the Python ecosystem using parallel computing that integrates well with Pandas. Dask can handle datasets that are larger than your machine's memory by breaking them into smaller pieces and processing these pieces in parallel. \`\`\`python from dask import dataframe as dd # This doesn't load your data yet. dask_df = dd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\") # Use Dask operations similar to Pandas. Operations are lazy and computed on call to .compute() # For example, to compute a simple aggregation: result = dask_df.sum().compute() \`\`\` # 3. Optimize Data Types If you still need to use Pandas and wish to read in the entire dataset, you can attempt to reduce memory usage by optimizing data types. For example, if your dataset contains numeric columns with integer values, make sure they are read as the appropriate integer type (\`int8\`, \`int16\`, \`int32\`) rather than defaulting to \`int64\`. Similarly, convert float64 columns to float32 if precision allows. # 4. Increase Systems Memory This is more about your hardware capacity. For large datasets, it is often beneficial to have a system with a large amount of RAM. This might mean upgrading your current system or using a high-memory instance on a cloud platform. # 5. Database Solutions Another approach is to use database solutions designed to handle large datasets efficiently. You can import your CSV into a database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) and then query chunks of it as needed without loading the entire dataset into memory. # 6. Use \`usecols\` Parameter If you only need a subset of columns from your CSV file, you can decrease memory usage by specifying those columns using the \`usecols\` parameter in \`pd.read_csv()\`. \`\`\`python cols_to_use = ['Column1', 'Column2'] df = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\", usecols=cols_to_use) \`\`\` Choosing the right approach depends on your specific requirements, such as whether you need to process the data all at once, your hardware limitations, and the complexity of processing you're performing on the data."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Какие есть плюсы и минусы?","completion":"Да, Apache Spark можно развернуть в Docker. Это предоставляет несколько преимуществ, но также несет и некоторые ограничения. # Плюсы использования Spark в Docker: 1. **Стандартизация окружения:** Docker позволяет создавать легкие, переносимые контейнеры с необходимым программным обеспечением, что облегчает запуск Spark в различных средах (разработка, тестирование, продакшн) без необходимости дополнительной настройки. 2. **Изоляция зависимостей:** Каждый контейнер работает независимо, что означает, что его зависимости не конфликтуют с зависимостями, установленными на хост-системе или в других контейнерах. 3. **Быстрое масштабирование:** Docker упрощает масштабирование приложения, позволяя легко добавлять дополнительные инстансы Spark в ваш кластер. 4. **Упрощенное развертывание:** Docker может упростить процесс развертывания Spark, особенно когда используются оркестраторы контейнеров, такие как Kubernetes. Это может автоматизировать многие аспекты управления кластером Spark, такие как распределение обработки, мониторинг и логирование. # Минусы использования Spark в Docker: 1. **Проблемы с производительностью:** Использование виртуализации на уровне ОС может привести к некоторой накладной системной нагрузке, хотя в большинстве случаев она минимальна. Важно протестировать конкретные рабочие нагрузки, чтобы убедиться, что производительность удовлетворяет требованиям. 2. **Управление ресурсами:** Docker контейнеры запускаются на одном физическом или виртуальном хосте, что может создать конкуренцию за ресурсы. Необходимо тщательно настроить распределение ресурсов, чтобы гарантировать, что контейнеры не будут \\"голодать\\" из-за недостатка CPU, памяти или других ресурсов. 3. **Сетевая конфигурация:** Могут возникнуть сложности с конфигурацией сети, особенно в кластерных развертываниях, где требуется обеспечить правильное взаимодействие между контейнерами. 4. **Управление данными:** При работе с большими объемами данных необходимо тщательно спланировать, как эти данные будут храниться, передаваться и обрабатываться между контейнерами, чтобы избежать узких мест в производительности. В целом, развертывание Spark в Docker может быть очень полезным во многих сценариях, особенно при разработке и тестировании, но требует тщательного планирования и настройки для обеспечения производительности и масштабируемости в продакшн средах."},{"prompt":"Для чего нужна Apache kafka","completion":"Apache Kafka — это распределенная потоковая платформа, которая первоначально была разработана LinkedIn и впоследствии стала частью проектов Apache Software Foundation. Kafka широко используется для построения реальных потоковых приложений и обработки потоков данных в высоконагруженных системах. Здесь приведены ключевые области применения и функции Apache Kafka: # 1. Обработка потоковых данных: - **Потоковая передача данных**: Kafka позволяет надежно передавать данные от источников к приемникам в реальном времени, что полезно в сценариях, где необходима скорая обработка, например, в системах мониторинга, логирования и сбора телеметрии. - **Обработка событий**: Kafka эффективно поддерживает паттерны обработки событий, предоставляя возможности для фильтрации, агрегации и преобразования данных в реальном времени. # 2. Реализация системы обмена сообщениями: - **Надежная очередь сообщений**: Kafka может служить мощной системой обмена сообщениями, поддерживающей различные паттерны обмена, включая очереди point-to-point и publish-subscribe. - **Декаплинг производителей и потребителей**: Kafka разделяет производителей и потребителей данных, позволяя независимо масштабировать их и обновлять без прямого взаимодействия. # 3. Хранение данных: - **Надежное хранение**: Kafka предоставляет гарантии на уровне дискового хранения, что делает платформу подходящей для задач, где требуется надежное и долговременное хранение потоков данных. - **Воспроизведение данных**: Данные в Kafka могут храниться в течение конфигурируемого периода времени, поддерживая потребности в аудите, восстановлении после сбоев и исследованиях. # 4. Интеграция систем: - **Платформа как основа для ETL**: Kafka широко используется в качестве канала для перемещения данных между системами, особенно в задачах ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), где данные из различных источников агрегируются и трансформируются перед загрузкой в хранилище данных. - **Децентрализованная архитектура**: Поддерживая распределенную архитектуру, Kafka позволяет создавать сложные, масштабируемые и надежные системы интеграции. # 5. Поддержка микросервисной архитектуры: - **Асинхронное общение между микросервисами**: Kafka позволяет микросервисам обмениваться сообщениями и данными без строгих зависимостей, что повышает отказоустойчивость и масштабируемость системы. Apache Kafka является многоцелевой платформой, которая может быть использована в различных сценариях, от сбора логов и мониторинга до сложных потоковых приложений и микросервисных архитектур, благодаря своей высокой производительности, надежности и масштабируемости."},{"prompt":"Я хочу получать данные с криптобиржы и хранить их у себя на машине. Что для этого лучше подойдет: PostgreSQL иди Spark?","completion":"Выбор между PostgreSQL и Apache Spark для хранения данных с криптобиржи зависит от нескольких ключевых факторов, включая объем данных, необходимость обработки и анализа данных в реальном времени, и требования к масштабируемости и производительности. Давайте рассмотрим, в каких случаях и почему одна технология может быть предпочтительнее другой. # PostgreSQL **PostgreSQL** — это мощная, открытая, объектно-реляционная система управления базами данных (СУБД). Она идеально подходит для традиционных приложений, требующих надежного хранения, транзакционной поддержки и сложных запросов к данным. Когда выбрать PostgreSQL: - **Транзакционность и надежность**: Если для вас важна ACID-совместимость для гарантированной целостности данных. - **Сложные запросы**: PostgreSQL предлагает богатый функционал для выполнения сложных SQL-запросов, включая поддержку оконных функций, подзапросов и CTE. - **Умеренные объемы данных**: Если объем собираемых данных не предполагает экстримального масштабирования и может эффективно управляться реляционной СУБД. # Apache Spark **Apache Spark** — это мощная, распределенная система обработки данных, предназначенная для больших объемов данных. Она выделяется своей способностью быстро выполнять сложные алгоритмы обработки данных на больших наборах данных благодаря использованию in-memory вычислений. Когда выбрать Apache Spark: - **Обработка и анализ больших объемов данных**: Если вам нужно собирать, обрабатывать, и анализировать огромные объемы данных с криптобирж в реальном времени или почти в реальном времени. - **Масштабируемость**: Если предполагается быстрый рост данных, Spark позволяет легко масштабировать обработку на кластере из множества машин. - **Аналитика и машинное обучение**: Spark включает в себя библиотеки для выполнения сложных аналитических запросов и алгоритмов машинного обучения на больших данных, что делает его идеальным для аналитики в реальном времени. # Важно помнить: - **Хранилище vs Обработка**: PostgreSQL — это, прежде всего, система управления базами данных, предназначенная для хранения и управления структурированными данными. Apache Spark — это инструмент для обработки и анализа данных, который хоть и может интерпретировать и временно хранить данные во время обработки, не предназначен для долгосрочного хранения данных. - **Интеграция**: В некоторых сценариях можно сочетать обе технологии — использовать Spark для обработки и анализа данных в реальном времени, а затем сохранять обработанные данные в PostgreSQL для долгосрочного хранения, индексации и сложных запросов. Исходя из вашего запроса, если основной задачей является сбор и хранение данных с криптобиржи с возможностью выполнения сложных запросов и анализа на умеренных объемах данных, **PostgreSQL** может быть лучшим выбором из-за его надежности и мощных возможностей SQL. Если же вы планируете обрабатывать огромные объемы данных в реальном времени с последующим анализом, и ваша инфраструктура требует высокой масштабируемости и быстрой обработки, **Apache Spark** предложит значительные преимущества."},{"prompt":"Хмммм. Т.е. Apache Spark не предполагает долгого хранения данных в себе?","completion":"Верно, Apache Spark не предназначен для долгосрочного хранения данных. Apache Spark — это система для обработки и анализа больших объемов данных в памяти (in-memory) и на диске в распределенной манере, но он сам по себе не обеспечивает механизмов для долговременного хранения данных. Его основная задача — быстрая обработка данных, включая выполнение сложных вычислений, ETL-процессы, машинное обучение и анализ данных в реальном времени. Apache Spark часто используется в сочетании с системами для хранения данных, такими как Hadoop HDFS (распределенная файловая система), Amazon S3 (облачное хранилище), NoSQL базы данных (например, Cassandra) или традиционные реляционные СУБД (например, PostgreSQL), где эти системы хранения данных используются для долгосрочного хранения. Spark выполняет обработку и анализ этих данных, а затем результаты могут быть сохранены обратно в систему хранения данных или переданы дальше для использования другими приложениями. При использовании Spark для работы с данными, обычно данные извлекаются из хранилища данных, временно загружаются в вычислительные узлы Spark для обработки, после чего результаты обработки могут быть либо использованы напрямую (например, для отчетности или визуализации), либо сохранены назад в систему хранения данных для долговременного хранения или дальнейшего использования. Таким образом, если вам нужно не просто обработать данные с криптобиржи, но и обеспечить их сохранность на длительный срок, вам следует рассмотреть использование системы управления базами данных или системы хранения данных в дополнение к Apache Spark для обработки и аналитики данных."},{"prompt":"Расскажи про Hadoop HDFS","completion":"Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) — это распределенная файловая система, специально разработанная для хранения и управления очень большими объемами данных в распределенных вычислительных средах. HDFS является ключевой частью экосистемы Apache Hadoop, предоставляя надежную и масштабируемую платформу для хранения данных, оптимизированную под последовательное чтение/запись больших файлов и работу с данными в блоках фиксированного размера (по умолчанию 128 MB или 256 MB). # Основные характеристики HDFS: 1. **Распределенная архитектура:** Данные в HDFS автоматически разделяются на блоки и распределяются по узлам в кластере, что обеспечивает высокую доступность и параллельную обработку данных. 2. **Надежность:** HDFS реализует механизмы репликации данных по нескольким узлам, что обеспечивает высокую надежность хранения даже в случае отказа отдельных компонентов системы. 3. **Масштабируемость:** Система может эффективно работать как с небольшими, так и с очень большими кластерами, расширяясь до тысяч узлов и петабайт данных. 4. **Высокая производительность:** Благодаря распределенной архитектуре и параллельной обработке данных HDFS позволяет обеспечить высокую скорость чтения/записи данных. 5. **Эффективная работа с большими файлами:** HDFS оптимизирована для работы с файлами большого размера, позволяя эффективно хранить и обрабатывать данные, объем которых может значительно превышать размеры оперативной памяти узлов. # Компоненты HDFS: - **NameNode:** Управляющий компонент HDFS, который хранит метаданные файловой системы (структуру директорий, информацию о файлах, распределение блоков по DataNodes и т.п.) и контролирует доступ к данным. NameNode не хранит сами данные, а лишь управляет их расположением. - **DataNode:** Узлы, на которых физически хранятся данные. Данные в HDFS разбиваются на блоки, которые распределяются и хранятся на DataNodes согласно политике репликации. - **Secondary NameNode** или **Standby NameNode (в HA конфигурациях):** Выполняет функции, связанные с поддержкой работоспособности и синхронизацией метаданных NameNode, обеспечивая возможность восстановления системы после сбоев. # Применение HDFS: HDFS применяется в задачах, требующих обработки и хранения очень больших объемов данных, таких как лог-анализ, обработка больших наборов данных в областях научных исследований, Big Data аналитика и обработка данных интернета вещей (IoT). Стоит заметить, что HDFS имеет свои ограничения, например, не оптимизирована для работы с большим количеством маленьких файлов и не поддерживает операции в реальном времени из-за высокой задержки доступа к данным. Тем не менее, в сочетании с другими компонентами экосистемы Hadoop, такими как YARN для управления ресурсами кластера и MapReduce или Apache Spark для обработки данных, HDFS предоставляет мощную основу для построения эффективных систем обработки Big Data."},{"prompt":"HDFS хорошо подходит для хранения данных с криптобирж?","completion":"HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) может использоваться для хранения данных с криптобирж, особенно если у вас есть большие объемы данных, требующие распределенного хранения и обработки. Однако, выбирая HDFS для конкретной задачи, важно учитывать некоторые аспекты и требования к данным и обработке. # Преимущества использования HDFS для хранения данных с криптобирж: 1. **Масштабируемость:** HDFS спроектирована для хранения и обработки очень больших объемов данных. Если данные с криптобирж растут с высокой скоростью, HDFS может обеспечить необходимую масштабируемость. 2. **Надежность:** Благодаря механизму репликации данных HDFS обеспечивает высокую степень доступности и долговечности данных, что критически важно для финансовых данных. 3. **Поддержка больших файлов:** HDFS эффективно работает с большими файлами, что хорошо подходит для сценариев, когда данные агрегируются в большие пакеты перед обработкой. 4. **Интеграция с экосистемой Hadoop:** HDFS легко интегрируется с другими инструментами для обработки данных, такими как Apache Spark, Apache Hive и другими, что позволяет эффективно анализировать полученные данные. # Возможные ограничения и соображения: 1. **Обновление данных:** HDFS лучше всего подходит для сценариев добавления данных, а не для случаев, когда данные нужно часто обновлять или модифицировать. 2. **Латентность доступа:** HDFS не оптимизирована для задач, требующих быстрого случайного доступа к данным или операций с малыми задержками. 3. **Управление малыми файлами:** Если данные с криптобирж генерируют большое количество малых файлов, это может стать проблемой для HDFS, поскольку каждый файл и каталог в HDFS потребляет память в NameNode. 4. **Сложность управления:** Развертывание и управление кластером Hadoop/HDFS требует определенной квалификации и может быть сложным для малых команд или проектов с ограниченными ресурсами. В зависимости от конкретных требований вашего проекта и того, как вы планируете использовать данные с криптобирж, HDFS может быть хорошим выбором для хранения и последующей обработки данных. Однако, если ваши нужды связаны с частым обновлением данных, требуют мгновенного доступа к данным или работу с большим количеством маленьких файлов, рассмотрите другие решения или комбинацию технологий для хранения и обработки данных."},{"prompt":"Какие есть аналоги HDFS?","completion":"Есть несколько аналогов и альтернатив HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), которые могут быть использованы в различных сценариях для хранения и обработки больших объемов данных.

Её основные характеристики включают высокую доступность, масштабируемость, и надежное хранение данных, что делает Cassandra хорошим выбором для таких задач, как структурирование и хранение данных с криптобирж. Давайте рассмотрим, почему Apache Cassandra может быть подходящим вариантом для этой цели: # Производительность и масштабируемость Cassandra известна своей способностью эффективно масштабироваться, поддерживая в то же время высокую производительность даже при увеличении объемов данных и количества запросов. Это особенно важно для криптобирж, где объемы транзакций могут резко возрастать. # Распределенная архитектура База данных Cassandra имеет распределенную архитектуру, что делает её устойчивой к сбоям. Данные автоматически реплицируются между узлами, что обеспечивает высокую доступность и устойчивость к отказам. Это критически важно для систем, ориентированных на непрерывную работу, таких как платформы электронной коммерции или криптобиржи. # Толерантность к лагам и географическое распределение Cassandra построена с расчетом на то, что некоторые узлы могут временно быть недоступны или отставать в данных. Она поддерживает географическое распределение данных с низкой задержкой записи и чтения, что является большим преимуществом для криптобирж, работающих в разных юрисдикциях. # Гибкий дизайн схемы Несмотря на то что Cassandra предлагает схему \\"без схемы\\" с динамической структурой данных, она всё же позволяет вам определять структурированные схемы данных, оптимизированные под конкретные запросы и операции. Это может быть полезным для организации и анализа данных с криптобирж, учитывая их структурированную природу и необходимость в быстром доступе. # Высокая скорость записи Cassandra была спроектирована для обеспечения очень быстрой скорости записи данных, что делает её идеальной для сценариев, требующих высокой производительности записи, таких как запись транзакций и ценовых котировок в реальном времени с криптобирж. # Поддержка для временных рядов Данные с криптобирж часто представляют собой временные ряды (например, исторические данные о ценах). Cassandra эффективно хранит и обрабатывает данные временных рядов, что делает её подходящей для таких задач. # Вывод Apache Cassandra — это мощный выбор для хранения данных с криптобирж благодаря своей масштабируемости, производительности и надежности. Важно отметить, что эффективное использование Cassandra требует внимательного планирования схемы данных и управления ресурсами, чтобы полностью реализовать её потенциал и достичь желаемой производительности и масштабируемости."},{"prompt":"Какие есть плюсы и минусы Apache Cassandra","completion":"Apache Cassandra — это мощная распределённая NoSQL база данных, известная своей высокой доступностью и масштабируемостью. Она широко используется для приложений, где требуются большой объём данных и высокая скорость записи и чтения. Как и любая технология, Cassandra имеет свои преимущества и недостатки, которые важно учитывать при выборе системы управления базами данных. # Плюсы Apache Cassandra: 1. **Высокая масштабируемость**: Cassandra отличается выдающейся масштабируемостью как горизонтальной, так и вертикальной, позволяя системе расти вместе с увеличением данных и нагрузки без потери производительности. 2. **Высокая доступность и устойчивость к отказам**: Данные в Cassandra автоматически реплицируются на несколько узлов. В случае сбоев, данные все ещё доступны с других узлов, что обеспечивает отличную доступность и устойчивость к отказам. 3. **Гибкость схемы данных**: Cassandra позволяет изменять схему данных \\"на лету\\", что позволяет легко адаптировать структуру данных под изменяющиеся требования приложения. 4. **Распределённая архитектура**: Cassandra имеет встроенную поддержку распределённых операций, предоставляя естественный способ географического распределения данных и запросов для глобальных приложений. 5. **Оптимизация для производительности**: Спроектированная для быстрой записи и чтения больших объёмов данных, Cassandra обеспечивает высокую производительность даже при работе с огромными наборами данных. # Минусы Apache Cassandra: 1. **Сложность запросов**: Cassandra не поддерживает столь же сложные запросы, как реляционные СУБД, например, операции соединения или подзапросы, что ограничивает возможности запросов и анализа данных. 2. **Консистентность данных**: Cassandra использует модель консистентности, основанную на теореме CAP, что означает, что в некоторых случаях может возникать задержка в достижении полной консистентности данных между узлами. 3. **Управление ресурсами**: Высокая производительность Cassandra достигается за счёт интенсивного использования системных ресурсов, таких как дисковое пространство и оперативная память, что может создать вызовы при ограниченных ресурсах. 4. **Кривая обучения**: Для эффективного использования и администрирования Cassandra требуется время и опыт. Настройка кластера, проектирование схемы данных и настройка производительности могут представлять сложность для новых пользователей. 5. **Обслуживание и мониторинг**: Как и любая распределённая система, Cassandra требует продуманных стратегий резервного копирования, восстановления и мониторинга для обеспечения стабильной работоспособности системы на больших объёмах данных.

Однако стоит отметить, что официальная поддержка Cassandra для Windows была прекращена после версии 3.11, и установка на чистой Windows может потребовать дополнительных шагов или обходных решений. # Использование Docker Один из самых простых и рекомендуемых способов развертывания Cassandra на Windows — использование Docker. Docker позволяет создавать изолированные контейнеры для приложений и их зависимостей, что обеспечивает высокую степень совместимости и упрощает развертывание. 1. **Установите Docker для Windows.** - Скачайте и установите Docker Desktop с официального сайта Docker. - Убедитесь, что Docker успешно запущен. 2. **Откройте командную строку или PowerShell и запустите контейнер Cassandra.** \`\`\`bash docker run --name my-cassandra -d -p 9042:9042 cassandra \`\`\` Эта команда скачает образ Cassandra из Docker Hub (если он уже не скачан) и запустит контейнер с именем \\"my-cassandra\\". Порт 9042 (стандартный порт CQL для Cassandra) будет проброшен из контейнера на ваш хост. 3. **Для взаимодействия с Cassandra, откройте CQLSH (Cassandra Query Language SHell) внутри контейнера.** \`\`\`bash docker exec -it my-cassandra cqlsh \`\`\` С помощью этого подхода вы можете избежать многих трудностей, связанных с ручной установкой и настройкой Cassandra на Windows и сразу начать работать с базой данных. # Использование WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Если предпочтитаете ближе к нативной среде разработки без Docker, можете использовать WSL для установки и запуска Cassandra в Linux-окружении внутри Windows. 1. **Установите WSL на вашем ПК с Windows 10.** - В PowerShell от имени администратора выполните: \`\`\`powershell wsl --install \`\`\` - Перезагрузите компьютер, если это необходимо. 2. **Выберите дистрибутив Linux из Microsoft Store (например, Ubuntu) и установите его.** 3. **Запустите установленный дистрибутив Linux и выполните обновление.** \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade \`\`\` 4. **Установите Java (Cassandra требуется Java для запуска).** \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk \`\`\` 5. **Скачайте и установите Apache Cassandra согласно инструкциям на официальном сайте или из репозитория Ubuntu.** \`\`\`bash echo \\"deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main\\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.list sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install cassandra \`\`\` 6. **Запустите службу Cassandra и проверьте статус.** \`\`\`bash sudo service cassandra start sudo service cassandra status \`\`\` - После этого вы сможете использовать CQLSH в WSL для работы с Cassandra.

Каждая из этих технологий имеет свои сильные и слабые стороны в контексте разных сценариев использования. Вот некоторые аспекты, которые стоит учесть при принятии решения: # Волатильность и объем данных - **Cassandra** идеально подходит для сценариев с очень большими объемами данных, которые необходимо записывать и читать с высокой скоростью. Ее распределенная архитектура обеспечивает высокую доступность и отказоустойчивость. Если данные о курсах биткойна поступают с высокой частотой и вам нужно обеспечить быструю запись и распределенное хранение, Cassandra может быть хорошим выбором. - **PostgreSQL** является реляционной СУБД, отличающейся высокой надежностью и гибкостью. Она хорошо подходит для комплексной обработки транзакций и сложных SQL-запросов. Если данные о курсах биткойна необходимо анализировать совместно с другой финансовой информацией и требуется сложный анализ с помощью SQL, PostgreSQL может быть более предпочтительным выбором. # Согласованность данных - **Cassandra** использует модель согласованности \\"в конечном счете\\", что может быть приемлемо для некоторых приложений, работающих с данными о курсах криптовалют, где небольшая задержка согласованности данных между узлами не является критической. - **PostgreSQL** обеспечивает строгую ACID-согласованность, что делает ее надежным выбором для приложений, требующих точных и последовательных данных в любой момент времени. # Масштабируемость - **Cassandra** предлагает выдающуюся горизонтальную масштабируемость, позволяя легко добавлять новые узлы в кластер без простоев, что идеально подходит для быстрорастущих наборов данных. - **PostgreSQL** традиционно лучше подходит для вертикальной масштабируемости, и хотя существуют способы горизонтального масштабирования (например, через использование Citus), это может быть более сложно реализовать по сравнению с Cassandra. # Запросы и анализ данных - **PostgreSQL** предлагает мощные возможности для выполнения сложных SQL-запросов, включая соединения, подзапросы и оконные функции, что делает ее отличным выбором для глубокого анализа данных. - **Cassandra** предназначена для быстрого доступа к большим объемам данных, но она имеет ограниченные возможности запросов по сравнению с PostgreSQL, особенно когда речь идет о сложных соединениях или агрегациях данных. # Резюме Если ваш приоритет — гибкость запросов, сложный анализ данных и строгая согласованность, **PostgreSQL** может быть лучшим выбором. Если вы ожидаете обрабатывать огромные объемы данных с высокой скоростью записи и чтения, при этом готовы жертвовать сложностью запросов в пользу масштабируемости и производительности, **Cassandra** будет предпочтительнее.

Пример реализации поиска тренда курса биткойна с помощью обучения с подкреплением может включать в себя следующие шаги: # 1. Определение среды Сначала необходимо четко определить среду, с которой будет взаимодействовать RL-агент. В случае с курсом биткойна среда может включать в себя исторические данные о цене, объеме торгов, другие макроэкономические индикаторы и любые другие данные, которые могут быть релевантны для прогнозирования движения цены. # 2. Определение состояний, действий и награды - **Состояние (State):** Состояния могут включать в себя текущие значения различных технических индикаторов (например, скользящие средние, индикатор RSI, MACD и так далее), а также данные о предыдущих сделках агента. - **Действие (Action):** Потенциальные действия могут включать покупку (или удержание позиции), продажу (или закрытие позиции) и ничего не делать (удерживать текущую позицию без изменений). - **Награда (Reward):** Награда может быть основана на изменении цены после совершения действия, например, разнице в цене купли/продажи, что является приростом или потерей для агента. # 3. Выбор модели обучения с подкреплением Для задачи можно использовать различные модели и алгоритмы обучения с подкреплением, включая Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradients, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) и др. Выбор алгоритма зависит от сложности задачи, размера пространства состояний и действий, а также доступности вычислительных ресурсов. # 4. Тренировка агента Тренировка RL-агента состоит в итеративном процессе взаимодействия с средой и обновлении стратегии действий на основе полученных наград. Это требует большого количества итераций и экспериментов для настройки параметров и выбора наилучшей стратегии. # 5. Тестирование и оценка После тренировки агента его производительность должна быть тщательно оценена на тестовой выборке или в реальных условиях (в зависимости от доступности данных и возможностей). # Особенности применения RL для трейдинга При применении RL к финансовому трейдингу важно учитывать специфику и высокую волатильность рынка, а также возможное отставание в обучении от текущих реальных условий рынка.

Ниже представлен базовый пример того, как можно начать реализацию DQN с LSTM в PyTorch для среды Gym: # Шаг 1: Создаем сеть DQN с использованием LSTM \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim class DQNLSTM(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size): super(DQNLSTM, self).__init__() self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True) self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) def forward(self, x, hidden): x, hidden = self.lstm(x, hidden) x = self.fc(x[:, -1, :]) # Берем только последний выход для каждой последовательности return x, hidden def init_hidden(self, batch_size): # Инициализируем скрытое состояние и состояние ячейки в начале каждого эпизода return (torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size), torch.zeros(num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)) \`\`\` # Шаг 2: Инициализация среды Gym, сети и оптимизатора \`\`\`python import gym env = gym.make('CartPole-v0') # Пример среды n_actions = env.action_space.n # Количество возможных действий # Параметры модели input_size = env.observation_space.shape[0] # Размерность пространства состояний hidden_size = 128 # Размер скрытого слоя LSTM num_layers = 2 # Количество слоев LSTM output_size = n_actions # Количество действий model = DQNLSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size) optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters()) criterion = nn.MSELoss() \`\`\` # Шаг 3: Основной цикл обучения \`\`\`python # Это очень упрощенный пример основного цикла обучения for episode in range(1000): # Количество эпизодов state = env.reset() state = torch.tensor(state, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0) # Преобразуем состояние hidden = model.init_hidden(1) done = False while not done: # Выбор действия (в этом примере случайным образом) action = env.action_space.sample() # Выполнение действия next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action) next_state = torch.tensor(next_state, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(0) # (Здесь должно быть обновление модели с использованием выбранного действия, # полученной награды, следующего состояния и флага окончания) state = next_state \`\`\` Этот код – только отправная точка, демонстрирующая интеграцию сети DQN с LSTM в PyTorch и её использование в среде Gym. Для полноценного обучения с подкреплением потребуется реализовать механизмы выбора действий (например, с использованием epsilon-жадной стратегии), буфера воспроизведения опыта (experience replay) для эффективного обучения и процедуры обновления сети на основе разницы между предсказанными и фактическими Q-значениями. Обратите внимание на то, что обучение сетей DQN с LSTM может быть вычислительно затратным и требовать тонкой настройки и экспериментирования с гиперпараметрами для достижения удовлетворительных результатов."},{"prompt":"Как в OKX тестировать запросы, выставляемые на биржу, только через демо счёт","completion":"OKX (ранее известная как OKEx) является одной из крупнейших мировых криптовалютных бирж, предлагающей широкий спектр услуг, включая торговлю криптовалютами, фьючерсами и опционами. Для разработчиков и трейдеров, желающих тестировать свои стратегии или приложения, OKX предоставляет возможность использования демо-счета, также известного как тестовая сеть или симулятор торгов. Демо-счет позволяет тестировать стратегии торговли и запросы на биржу без риска потери реальных средств, предоставляя виртуальные средства для проведения сделок в условиях, максимально приближенных к реальным. Вот как вы можете начать тестирование на демо-счете OKX: # Шаг 1: Регистрация демо-счета 1. Посетите официальный сайт OKX и найдите раздел \\"Бесплатная торговля на демо\\". Обычно, для доступа к тестовой среде может потребоваться отдельная регистрация, отличная от вашего основного торгового счета. 2. Пройдите процесс регистрации, который может включать ввод контактной информации и настройку учетной записи. # Шаг 2: Использование API Если вы планируете использовать API для тестирования запросов на биржу: 1. **Получение API-ключа**: Для доступа к API на демо-счете вам, скорее всего, потребуется получить отдельный API-ключ. Настройки демо-счета обычно содержат раздел, где можно генерировать или управлять API-ключами. 2. **Изучение документации API**: Очень важно тщательно изучить документацию API, чтобы понять доступные эндпоинты, лимиты и специфику отправки запросов. Документация должна также содержать информацию о том, как использовать демо-версию для тестирования. 3. **Разработка и тестирование**: С использованием полученных API-ключей вы можете начать разработку своего приложения или торгового бота, тестируя запросы через предоставленные эндпоинты тестовой сети. # Шаг 3: Тестирование стратегий торговли Демо-счет предоставляет идеальную платформу для тестирования и отладки стратегий торговли. Вы можете: - Проводить симулированные торговые операции, используя виртуальные средства. - Анализировать результаты и корректировать стратегии в ответ на поведение рынка в тестовой среде. - Тестировать различные сценарии, включая реакцию на изменение рыночных условий и новости. # Важные моменты: - **Лимиты и условия**: Обратите внимание на любые ограничения или условия использования тестовой сети, включая лимиты на количество запросов и виртуальный баланс. - **Тестовая среда vs Реальная торговля**: Помните, что поведение и ликвидность в тестовой сети могут отличаться от реальных торговых условий. Использование демо-счета на OKX является отличным способом для разработчиков и трейдеров тестировать свои инструменты и стратегии, не подвергая рискам реальные средства."},{"prompt":"Так как используя OKX API выставлять торговые запросы на демо счёт?","completion":"К сожалению, на момент моего последнего обновления (сентябрь 2023 года), официальной информации о том, предоставляет ли OKX (ранее известная как OKEx) прямую поддержку демо-счетов через свой API для публичного доступа, не существует. Однако, вы можете воспользоваться несколькими подходами для разработки и тестирования торговых стратегий с минимальными рисками: # 1. Проверьте актуальную информацию: Первым делом нужно проверить на официальном сайте OKX или в их официальной документации API на предмет предоставления тестовой среды или демо-счетов. Информация о функциональных возможностях и условиях использования может меняться. # 2. Используйте Sandbox (если доступно): Некоторые криптовалютные биржи предоставляют тестовые среды или \\"песочницы\\" (sandbox environments), которые позволяют разработчикам тестировать свои приложения и торговые стратегии в условиях, максимально приближенных к реальным, но без риска реальных средств. Если такая среда доступна для OKX, она, скорее всего, будет описана в документации к API. # 3. Использование минимальных объемов средств: Если демо-счет или sandbox не доступны, одним из способов тестировать вашу интеграцию и стратегии является использование минимально возможных объемов средств и торгов на бирже. Выбирайте минимально допустимые объемы заявок, чтобы минимизировать финансовый риск. # 4. Тестирование на сторонних платформах: Еще один вариант — использование имитационного торгового программного обеспечения или платформ, которые могут имитировать работу с реальным API биржи. Такие платформы могут предложить эмуляцию торговли в условиях, близких к рынку, с возможностью подключения к API биржи для тестирования. # 5. Обратитесь в поддержку OKX: В случае, если нигде не указана информация о демо-счете или песочнице, рассмотрите возможность обращения в службу поддержки OKX с вопросом о возможностях тестирования API. # Важное замечание: При использовании API для торговли или тестирования всегда убеждайтесь, что вы следуете лучшим практикам безопасности, включая защиту ваших аутентификационных данных (API-ключей), использование шифрования для ваших подключений и соблюдение ограничений и лимитов API. Убедитесь, что вы регулярно проверяете обновления от OKX относительно использования их API, поскольку платформы часто обновляют свои услуги и могут добавлять новые функции или изменять условия использования."},{"prompt":"А выставление спотовых ордеров взимает комисию на OKX","completion":"Да, как и на большинстве криптовалютных бирж, OKX взимает комиссию за выставление спотовых ордеров. Размер комиссии может зависеть от нескольких факторов, включая тип ордера, объем торгов и ваш уровень в системе уровней комиссий биржи. OKX, как правило, предлагает два типа комиссий для спотовой торговли: 1. **Комиссия за выполнение ордера \\"мейкер\\" (maker fee)**: Взимается с тех торговцев, ордера которых добавляют ликвидность на рынок. Это означает, что ордер не был немедленно исполнен по текущим рыночным ценам и вместо этого был добавлен в стакан ордеров. Комиссии мейкера часто ниже, чем у тейкера, поскольку мейкеры способствуют увеличению ликвидности на рынке. 2. **Комиссия за выполнение ордера \\"тейкер\\" (taker fee)**: Взимается с торговцев, чьи ордера немедленно исполняются против ордеров, уже стоящих в стакане, тем самым \\"забирая\\" ликвидность с рынка. Такие ордера обычно имеют более высокие комиссии, поскольку тейкеры сокращают доступную ликвидность. **Уровни комиссий и VIP-статусы:** OKX использует систему уровней комиссий, которая зависит от объема ваших торгов за последние 30 дней и/или ваших остатков на счету в токенах OKB (собственный токен биржи). Пользователи с более высоким торговым объемом или балансом OKB могут получить более низкие комиссии как за мейкерские, так и за тейкерские ордера. Комиссии постоянно обновляются и могут изменяться в зависимости от рыночных условий и политики биржи. Для получения актуальной информации о структуре комиссий OKX и условиях торговли рекомендуется посетить официальный сайт биржи или обратиться в раздел поддержки. Также стоит отметить, что некоторые действия, такие как депозиты и вывод средств, также могут подлежать комиссиям или ограничениям, и эти условия зависят от выбранной криптовалюты и метода платежа."},{"prompt":"Расскажи про хранилище данных Parquet","completion":"Формат данных Parquet представляет собой открытый и чрезвычайно эффективный колоночный формат хранения, предназначенный для использования в экосистемах больших данных и аналитики.

В контексте временных рядов автоэнкодеры могут быть особенно полезными для следующих задач: # Уменьшение размерности Временные ряды часто содержат данные высокой размерности, что делает их анализ и визуализацию затруднительными. Автоэнкодеры могут изучить представления данных меньшей размерности, что упрощает визуализацию и анализ, а также повышает эффективность последующего машинного обучения, например, кластеризации или классификации. # Обнаружение аномалий Одно из ключевых применений автоэнкодеров в анализе временных рядов — обнаружение аномалий. Путем обучения автоэнкодера на \\"нормальных\\" данных временных рядов, модель стремится минимизировать ошибку восстановления для типичных паттернов данных. Когда встречается аномальный отсчет данных, автоэнкодер, вероятно, будет иметь высокую ошибку восстановления, что позволяет идентифицировать потенциальные аномалии. # Денойзинг (шумоподавление) Автоэнкодеры могут быть обучены восстанавливать исходные сигналы из зашумленных данных, эффективно выполняя шумоподавление. Это может быть полезно для очистки временных рядов от случайного шума перед дальнейшим анализом или прогнозированием. # Генерация и синтез данных Объединенные с вариационными автоэнкодерами (VAE) или условными автоэнкодерами, автоэнкодеры могут быть использованы для генерации новых данных временных рядов, которые сохраняют статистические свойства исходных данных. Это может быть полезно для увеличения набора данных или создания синтетических данных для тестирования. # Для предварительной обработки и извлечения признаков Автоэнкодеры могут использоваться для извлечения значимых признаков из сложных временных рядов, которые затем могут служить входными данными для других моделей машинного обучения. Это может улучшить производительность последующих моделей, особенно если исходные данные являются многомерными или содержат сложные, нелинейные зависимости. # Как работают автоэнкодеры Автоэнкодеры обычно состоят из двух основных частей: энкодера, который сжимает входные данные в код меньшей размерности, и декодера, который пытается восстановить исходные данные из этого кода. Обучение автоэнкодеров заключается в минимизации потерь между входными данными и их восстановленной версией, заставляя автоэнкодер изучать наиболее важные или содержательные атрибуты данных."},{"prompt":"Расскажи про TCN (Временные сверточные сети)","completion":"Временные сверточные сети (Temporal Convolutional Networks, TCN) представляют собой архитектуру нейронной сети, оптимизированную для работы с временными рядами и последовательностями данных.

В Unity, если вы хотите, чтобы кнопка оставалась выделенной после нажатия, вам потребуется воспользоваться компонентом \`Selectable\` и его настройками, а также некоторым кодом. Существует несколько способов реализации этого поведения. Рассмотрим один из простых примеров. 1. **Использование состояний кнопки** Вы можете изменить графическое представление кнопки для разных состояний (например, Normal, Highlighted, Pressed, Selected, Disabled) через редактор Unity, задав нужные значения цветов, изображений и т.д., чтобы визуально показать, что кнопка остаётся выделенной после нажатия. 2. **Скрипт для \\"захвата\\" выделения кнопки** Для тонкой настройки поведения кнопки используйте скрипт. Ниже приведён пример скрипта на C#, который поможет оставить кнопку выделенной после нажатия. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; // Нужен для работы с системой событий public class ButtonHighlighter : MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler { private Button button; public Color defaultColor = Color.white; public Color selectedColor = Color.grey; void Start() { // Получаем компонент Button с текущего объекта button = GetComponent<Button>(); // Начальный цвет кнопки SetButtonColor(defaultColor); } public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData) { // Выделяем кнопку при клике SetButtonColor(selectedColor); // Оставляем кнопку выделенной EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(gameObject); } private void SetButtonColor(Color color) { ColorBlock cb = button.colors; cb.normalColor = color; cb.highlightedColor = color; button.colors = cb; } // Опционально: метод для сброса выделения кнопки public void ResetHighlight() { SetButtonColor(defaultColor); EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(null); } } \`\`\` Скрипт делает следующее: - Задаёт кнопке определённый цвет при нажатии и оставляет её выделенной через изменение цветов состояния. - \`IPointerClickHandler\` и его метод \`OnPointerClick\` используются для определения клика по кнопке. - Вам нужно будет настроить \`defaultColor\` и \`selectedColor\` в инспекторе Unity, чтобы определить цвета для разных состояний. 3. **Установка компонента на кнопку** Добавьте этот скрипт как компонент к вашей кнопке в Unity. Убедитесь, что у кнопки есть компонент \`Button\` и, если это необходимо, \`Image\` или \`Text\` для визуального отображения. Обратите внимание, что этот код — только один из возможных подходов к решению вашей задачи. Вы можете адаптировать его под свои нужды, например, добавив условия для изменения выделения при выполнении определённых условий в игре или приложении."},{"prompt":"мне нужно еще чтобы при нажатии на другую кнопку выделение с других снималось","completion":"Чтобы выделение с одной кнопки снималось при нажатии на другую, вам нужно создать систему, в которой кнопки могут \\"общаться\\" друг с другом и знать, какая из них в данный момент является выделенной. Это можно реализовать, используя менеджер, который будет следить за состоянием кнопок, или напрямую заставляя кнопки следить за состоянием друг друга. Однако первый способ лучше, так как он проще масштабируется и легче поддерживается. Ниже я представлю вам пример реализации через менеджер. 1. **Менеджер кнопок** Создадим простой менеджер, который будет управлять выбором кнопок и обеспечит, чтобы выделение с предыдущей кнопки снималось при выборе новой. \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class ButtonManager : MonoBehaviour { private ButtonHighlighter currentlySelectedButton; public List<ButtonHighlighter> buttons; public void SelectButton(ButtonHighlighter newSelection) { if (currentlySelectedButton != null) { currentlySelectedButton.ResetHighlight(); } currentlySelectedButton = newSelection; // Идентификатор для кнопки после ее нажатия // можно изменить на что-то более подходящее newSelection.SetSelected(); } } \`\`\` 2. **Скрипт выделения кнопки с интеграцией с менеджером** Теперь давайте немного модифицируем наш предыдущий скрипт \`ButtonHighlighter\` так, чтобы кнопка сообщала менеджеру о своем нажатии и чтобы она могла быть сброшена менеджером. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; public class ButtonHighlighter : MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler { private Button button; public ButtonManager manager; // Ссылка на менеджер public Color defaultColor = Color.white; public Color selectedColor = Color.grey; void Start() { button = GetComponent<Button>(); SetButtonColor(defaultColor); } public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData) { manager.SelectButton(this); } public void SetSelected() { SetButtonColor(selectedColor); } public void ResetHighlight() { SetButtonColor(defaultColor); } private void SetButtonColor(Color color) { ColorBlock cb = button.colors; cb.normalColor = color; cb.highlightedColor = color; button.colors = cb; } } \`\`\` 3. **Настройка в Unity** - Добавьте скрипт \`ButtonManager\` к какому-нибудь объекту в сцене, который будет действовать как менеджер кнопок. - В инспекторе Unity, найдите ваш объект с менеджером и перетащите все кнопки (на которые ранее был добавлен скрипт ButtonHighlighter) в список \`buttons\` в ButtonManager. - В каждом \`ButtonHighlighter\` укажите в поле \`manager\` ваш объект менеджера кнопок. Теперь, когда вы кликаете на одну из кнопок, менеджер сбрасывает выделение с текущей выбранной кнопки и выделяет новую, на которую было произведено нажатие.

Это могут быть фотографии, творческие работы, письма себе в будущем, цели на год или на более длительный период, музыкальные файлы, видео и т.д.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Обсуждение и выбор материала:</strong> На определенном уроке каждый ученик делится своими идеями относительно того, что он хотел бы включить в капсулу. Класс обсуждает и выбирает наиболее значимые и интересные предложения. Также можно создать несколько капсул по группам или темам.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Оформление капсулы:</strong> Ученики вместе с учителем создают виртуальную временную капсулу, используя доступные интернет-ресурсы и программы (например, облачные хранилища, веб-страницы, блоги). В этот процесс входит: дизайн, наполнение контентом, описание каждого элемента капсулы.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Закрытие капсулы:</strong> Договариваются о сроке, когда капсулу “откроют” – это может быть через год, через несколько лет. Устанавливают напоминание для всех участников проекта, чтобы в договоренный срок снова собраться онлайн и вспомнить этот момент.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Рефлексия:</strong> После “закрытия” капсулы провести обсуждение с классом: какие эмоции вызвало это задание, какие сложности возникли при работе в команде, какие ожидания связаны с будущим открытием капсулы.<br/><br/><strong>Польза:</strong> Этот интерактив не только поможет ученикам лучше узнать друг друга и работать в команде, но и научит их ценить настоящее, видеть перспективы и развивать ответственное отношение к своему будущему.USER: Придумай интерактив для беседы учеников онлайн школеASSISTANT: Конечно, вот ещё одна идея интерактива для онлайн-школьников, применимая для разных возрастных групп:<br/><br/><strong>Название интерактива:</strong> “Квест по знаниям”<br/><br/><strong>Цель:</strong> Повышение мотивации к обучению через игровой процесс, развитие навыков командной работы, критического мышления и исследовательских умений.<br/><br/><strong>Как проходит:</strong><br/><br/>1. <strong>Подготовка:</strong> Учитель разрабатывает или адаптирует квест согласно учебной программе, выбирая ключевые темы и концепции. Квест разделяется на несколько этапов или заданий, каждое из которых требует нахождения ответов или решения задач для перехода к следующему уровню.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Командообразование:</strong> Ученики делятся на малые группы. Для увеличения взаимодействия и кооперации между участниками, группы могут формироваться так, чтобы в них оказались ученики с разными навыками и знаниями.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Проведение квеста:</strong> Каждая группа начинает свой путь по квесту. Могут использоваться различные онлайн инструменты и ресурсы: от образовательных платформ и веб-сайтов до облачных сервисов и сообщений. Учитель отслеживает прогресс команд и, при необходимости, подает подсказки.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Итоговое задание:</strong> После прохождения основной части квеста, команды получают финальное задание, которое требует совместных усилий и креативного подхода. Это может быть проект, презентация или исследовательская работа, подведение итогов изученного.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Обсуждение и рефлексия:</strong> В конце мероприятия проводится сессия обсуждения. Ученики делятся впечатлениями о прохождении квеста, обсуждают, что было сложным, что нового они узнали, каким образом работа в команде способствовала достижению цели.<br/><br/><strong>Польза:</strong> Такой интерактив поможет ученикам применить теоретические знания на практике, улучшить навыки командной работы и критического мышления в увлекательной и динамичной форме, а также способствует углублению понимания учебного материала.USER: Придумай простой интерактив для беседы учеников онлайн школеASSISTANT: Конечно, вот идея простого интерактива для онлайн-беседы учеников разных возрастных групп:<br/><br/><strong>Название интерактива:</strong> “Тайный друг”<br/><br/><strong>Цель:</strong> Содействовать культуре взаимопонимания и уважения в классе, помочь ученикам лучше узнать друг друга.<br/><br/><strong>Как проходит:</strong><br/><br/>1. <strong>Подготовка:</strong> Учитель организует жеребьевку, в результате которой каждый ученик становится “тайным другом” для другого ученика. Имена получателей делятся случайным образом и конфиденциально, так чтобы никто не знал, кто его тайный друг.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Задания:</strong> В течение определенного периода (например, неделя), ученики должны выполнить несколько виртуальных добрых дел или заданий для своих тайных друзей. Это может быть написание мотивирующего сообщения, создание виртуальной открытки, подборка полезных учебных ресурсов по интересующей их теме, запись короткого видео-приветствия и т.п.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Обмен впечатлениями:</strong> В конце недели учащиеся делятся своими впечатлениями в онлайн-формате. Каждый ученик рассказывает, какие добрые дела он получил и пытается угадать, кто был его тайным другом.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Раскрытие:</strong> После обсуждения учитель раскрывает, кто кому был тайным другом. Ученики имеют возможность поблагодарить своих тайных друзей за проделанные добрые дела.<br/><br/><strong>Польза:</strong> Этот интерактив помогает создать атмосферу взаимопомощи и поддержки в классе, укрепляет дружеские связи между учениками и учит их заботе о других. Он также развивает креативное мышление и внимание к деталям, поскольку участникам необходимо придумать, чем они могут порадовать своего тайного друга виртуально.USER: Нужно оживить беседу учеников а онлайн школе, придумай интерактив, чтобы ученики начали активно общаться в беседеASSISTANT: Абсолютно, вот идея интерактива, который может оживить беседу учеников в онлайн школе и поспособствовать активному общению:<br/><br/><strong>Название интерактива:</strong> “Виртуальный вечер загадок”<br/><br/><strong>Цель:</strong> Стимулировать коммуникацию и взаимодействие между учениками, развивать навыки слушать и выражать свои идеи, а также улучшить креативное и критическое мышление.<br/><br/><strong>Как проходит:</strong><br/><br/>1. <strong>Подготовка:</strong> Учитель или ведущий заранее готовит список захватывающих загадок с разной степенью сложности. Можно выбрать тему загадок, связанную с предметом обучения или просто использовать разнообразные интересные загадки для развлечения.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Правила:</strong> Участникам объясняются правила – каждый имеет право предложить ответ на загадку через чат или, если формат занятия позволяет, устно через микрофон. Можно ввести дополнительный аспект игры, напимер, за каждый правильный ответ ученики получают баллы.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Реализация:</strong> Ведущий по очереди задаёт загадки, давая ученикам время на размышления и ответы. Обсуждаются варианты ответов, ведущий подводит итоги, объявляя правильные ответы и отмечая интересные и творческие идеи участников.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Интерактивный элемент:</strong> Можно организовать мини-турнир, где ученики делятся на команды, и каждая команда старается отгадать как можно больше загадок. Это добавляет элемент соревнования и сплочения внутри команд.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Обсуждение и фидбэк:</strong> По завершении игры можно обсудить, какие загадки были самыми сложными, наиболее интересными, и поговорить о логике или креативных способах решения. Также это отличный момент для получения обратной связи от учеников о том, понравилась ли им такая форма взаимодействия.<br/><br/><strong>Польза:</strong> Этот интерактивный формат помогает ученикам не только активно взаимодействовать и общаться друг с другом, но и развивает логическое мышление, внимание и способность работать в команде. Игровая форма делает обучение более увлекательным и динамичным.USER: Напиши короткий мотивационный текст для обучения в онлайн школеASSISTANT: Каждое занятие в онлайн школе — это новое приключение в мир знаний, где ты являешься главным героем своей учебной истории.

Напиши отчёт о проведенной практике в школе и предложения по ее улучшениюASSISTANT:","completion":"Отчёт о педагогической практике в школе Введение: В период с [начальная дата] по [конечная дата], я проходил педагогическую практику в [название школы], где получил возможность применить на практике теоретические знания, полученные во время обучения на факультете математики и физики. Практика предоставила ценный опыт работы с учениками, а также позволила глубже понять особенности преподавательской профессии. Описание деятельности: В течение практики мои задачи включали подготовку и проведение уроков по математике и физике, разработку методических материалов, проведение контрольных и самостоятельных работ, а также участие в внеурочной деятельности школы в качестве помощника организатора научных мероприятий. Особое внимание было уделено использованию интерактивных методов обучения для повышения интереса учеников к предметам. Анализ опыта: Через практику я понял, что успешное преподавание требует не только глубоких знаний предмета, но и умения заинтересовать учеников, доступно объяснять сложные концепции и поддерживать позитивную и продуктивную атмосферу в классе. Я заметил, что интерактивные занятия, такие как лабораторные эксперименты и математические игры, значительно повышают вовлеченность и интерес учеников. Предложения по улучшению: 1. **Увеличение числа интерактивных и практических занятий** - для более глубокого понимания учебного материала и развития практических навыков у учеников. 2. **Введение системы наставничества** - более опытные ученики могли бы помогать младшим и тем самым развивать свои коммуникативные навыки и глубже усваивать учебный материал. 3. **Использование современных образовательных технологий** - включение в учебный процесс электронных образовательных ресурсов, таких как образовательные приложения и онлайн-платформы, может сделать процесс обучения более интерактивным и динамичным. 4. **Организация тематических внеклассных мероприятий** - проведение научных фестивалей, олимпиад и конкурсов по математике и физике для стимулирования интереса учеников к предметам и развития их креативного мышления. Заключение: Педагогическая практика в [название школы] стала важным этапом в моем обучении, позволив получить неоценимый опыт и улучшить профессиональные навыки. Основываясь на анализе опыта и наблюдений, я предложил несколько направлений для дальнейшего улучшения учебного процесса, которые, на мой взгляд, могут сделать обучение более эффективным и интересным для учеников."},{"prompt":"\\"코드로 수정해주세요\\"를 영어로 영작해줘.","completion":"\\"Please modify it with code.\\""},{"prompt":"아래 코드에서 S_RDATA: begin rready = !fifo_full; if (rvalid_i && !fifo_full) begin fifo_wren = 1; if (rlast_i) begin state_n = S_WREQ; end else begin state_n = S_RDATA; end end end 이 부분은 fifo를 읽는 걸 어떻게 수행하는건가?

In this state, the code is primarily concerned with reading data into a FIFO (First In First Out) buffer. Here’s a breakdown of how the code performs FIFO reading and its subsequent actions: 1. **Fifo Full Check**: The \`rready\` signal is asserted (\`1\`) if the FIFO buffer is not full (\`!fifo_full\`). This means the DMA is ready to receive data (\`rready\`) if there is room in the FIFO. 2. **Data Reception and Writing to FIFO**: When both \`rvalid_i\` (indicating valid read data is available) and \`!fifo_full\` (indicating the FIFO is not full) are true, the \`fifo_wren\` signal is asserted (\`1\`). This action triggers writing the incoming data (\`rdata_i\`) into the FIFO buffer. - **Transition to Next State upon Last Data (\`rlast_i\`)**: If the incoming data is marked as the last data piece of the transfer (\`rlast_i\` is \`1\`), the state machine prepares to transition to the \`S_WREQ\` state. This transition indicates that the read phase is complete, and the DMA engine is ready to start the write request phase. - **Stay in Current State for More Data**: If it’s not the last data piece (\`rlast_i\` is \`0\`), the state remains as \`S_RDATA\`, indicating that the DMA engine continues to be in the data reception phase for further incoming data. This efficient handling facilitates continuous data transfer by ensuring data is read into the buffer as long as there is room, and making appropriate state transitions when necessary - either to continue reading more data or to proceed to the write request phase after the last piece of data is received. The \`DMAC_ENGINE\` module interacts with external components through AMBA AXI interface signals, adhering to the protocol standards for initiating data transfers, receiving data, and managing control signals ensuring robust data communication across the interfaces."},{"prompt":"한글로 출력해줘.","completion":"\`DMAC_ENGINE\` 모듈 내 제공된 코드는 \`S_RDATA\` 상태에서 DMA(Direct Memory Access, 직접 메모리 접근) 엔진의 동작을 설명합니다. 이 상태에서 코드는 주로 FIFO(First In First Out, 선입선출) 버퍼로 데이터를 읽는 작업을 합니다. 이 코드가 FIFO 읽기 및 후속 조치를 수행하는 방식을 나누어 설명하겠습니다: 1. **FIFO 가득 찼는지 확인**: FIFO 버퍼가 가득 차 있지 않으면 (\`!fifo_full\`), \`rready\` 신호가 활성화됩니다 (\`1\`). 이는 FIFO에 여유 공간이 있을 경우 DMA가 데이터를 받을 준비가 되었음을 의미합니다 (\`rready\`). 2. **데이터 수신 및 FIFO에 기록**: 유효한 읽기 데이터가 있음을 나타내는 \`rvalid_i\`와 FIFO가 가득 차 있지 않음을 나타내는 \`!fifo_full\`가 모두 참일 때 \`fifo_wren\` 신호가 활성화됩니다 (\`1\`). 이 동작은 들어오는 데이터 (\`rdata_i\`)를 FIFO 버퍼에 기록하도록 합니다. - **전송의 마지막 데이터 (\`rlast_i\`)에 대해 다음 상태로 전환**: 들어오는 데이터가 전송의 마지막 데이터 조각임을 표시하는 경우(\`rlast_i\`가 \`1\`), 상태 기계는 \`S_WREQ\` 상태로 전환할 준비를 합니다. 이 전환은 읽기 단계가 완료되었고 DMA 엔진이 쓰기 요청 단계를 시작할 준비가 되었음을 나타냅니다. - **더 많은 데이터에 대하여 현재 상태 유지**: 마지막 데이터 조각이 아닌 경우 (\`rlast_i\`가 \`0\`), 상태는 \`S_RDATA\`로 유지됩니다. 이는 DMA 엔진이 추가로 들어오는 데이터를 위해 데이터 수신 단계에서 계속 작동한다는 것을 나타냅니다. 이러한 효율적인 처리는 FIFO에 공간이 있는 한 데이터를 버퍼로 지속적으로 읽고, 필요한 경우 적절한 상태 전환을 함으로써 데이터를 계속 읽거나 마지막 데이터 수신 후 쓰기 요청 단계로 진행할 준비를 합니다. \`DMAC_ENGINE\` 모듈은 외부 구성 요소와 AMBA AXI 인터페이스 신호를 통해 상호 작용하여 데이터 전송을 시작하고, 데이터를 수신하며, 제어 신호를 관리하는 프로토콜 표준을 준수하여 인터페이스 간 견고한 데이터 통신을 보장합니다."},{"prompt":"이때 그럼 쓴 len을 어디에 기록하는가?","completion":"제공된 \`DMAC_ENGINE\` Verilog 코드에서 쓰기(write) 작업을 위한 길이(written length), 즉 데이터 전송 길이를 어느 곳에 기록하는지는 직접적으로 보이지 않습니다. 그러나 데이터 전송의 관리를 위해서는 전송 길이를 추적하는 메커니즘이 필수적입니다. 분석을 바탕으로, 전송 길이 및 관련 정보를 기록하고 추적하는 방식에 대해 설명하겠습니다. # 전송 길이 기록 방식: 일반적으로 전송 길이(\`byte_len_i\`)와 같은 정보는 DMA 전송을 시작하기 전에 설정하고, DMA 엔진이 전송을 진행하면서 내부적으로 사용 및 업데이트합니다. 코드 내에서 이를 직접적으로 표현하는 부분은 다음과 같이 설명될 수 있습니다. 1. **전송 길이 및 주소 업데이트**: \`S_RREQ\` 상태에서 읽기 주소(\`src_addr_n\`)를 업데이트하고, \`S_WREQ\` 상태에서는 쓰기 주소(\`dst_addr_n\`)를 업데이트합니다. 이 과정에서 전송 길이도 관리될 수 있으며, 실제로 길이가 \`cnt_n\`, \`wcnt_n\`과 같은 내부 레지스터에 기록 및 업데이트될 수 있습니다. \`\`\`verilog S_WREQ: begin awvalid = 1; if (awready_i) begin state_n = S_WDATA; dst_addr_n = dst_addr + 'd4; // 주소 업데이트 예 cnt_n = cnt - arlen_o; // 전송 길이 업데이트 예 end ... } \`\`\` 2. **FIFO 관리**: 데이터가 FIFO로 읽히거나 쓰여질 때, FIFO의 상태(\`fifo_full\`, \`fifo_empty\`)는 데이터 길이와 밀접하게 연관됩니다. FIFO에 쓰여지는 데이터 길이는 FIFO의 깊이 및 사용률을 반영하고, 이는 전송된 데이터의 양을 간접적으로 나타냅니다. 3. **카운터 사용**: DMA 전송에서는 종종 카운터(\`cnt\`, \`wcnt\` 등)를 이용해 현재까지 전송된 바이트 수나 남은 바이트 수를 추적합니다. 코드에서 \`cnt_n\`의 업데이트는 전송 길이를 관리하는 한 방법으로 볼 수 있습니다. #

GradNorm算法的基本工作原理： 1. **为每个任务损失分配权重**：在多任务模型中，每个任务( i )有自己的损失函数( L_i )和对应的权重( w_i )。权重初始可设为1，并作为可训练参数处理。 2. **计算初始任务损失的权重平均梯度**：在一定数量的训练迭代后，计算每个任务损失关于共享参数的梯度的L2范数，称为( G_i )，并计算这些梯度范数的平均( G_{avg} )。 3. **计算相对逆训练速率**：对于每个任务，计算损失下降的相对速度( R_i = L_i / L_{i,0} )，其中( L_{i,0} )是第( i )任务在训练开始时的初始损失。由此，我们可得到每个任务的相对逆训练速率( alpha_i = R_i / sum_j{R_j} )。 4. **调整每个任务的损失权重**：通过对权重进行梯度下降更新，使用一个特别设计的目标函数，这个目标函数旨在减小每个任务的梯度范数( |G_i - G_{avg} cdot alpha_i| )和之间的差异，调整权重使得所有任务的梯度尺度都尽可能接近。 #

**GradNorm算法基本步骤** 假设我们有一个多任务学习模型，该模型针对每个任务(i)都有一个损失(L_i)，以及相应的可学习权重(w_i)。 1. **初始设定**：开始训练之前，所有任务的损失权重(w_i)初始化为1，且可参与梯度下降过程。 2. **在一定数量的迭代后**，计算每个任务中损失函数(L_i)相对于共享网络参数的梯度范数(G_i)。然后计算所有任务的(G_i)的加权平均，以当前权重(w_i)作为权重。 3. **相对逆训练速率**：对每个任务，计算其损失相对于初始损失的比例(L_i / L_{i,0})，其中(L_{i,0})是训练开始时的初始损失值。接着，计算这个比例对所有任务的平均值，即相对逆训练速率。 4. **计算每个任务的目标梯度范数**：为了调整不同任务的学习速率，GradNorm首先计算一个目标梯度范数(G^{'}_i)，这是基于当前任务的相对逆训练速率和所有任务当前梯度范数的加权平均。 5. **调整损失权重**：通过最小化每个任务的当前梯度范数(G_i)与其目标梯度范数(G^{'}_i)之间的差异，来调整每个任务的损失权重(w_i)。这通常通过梯度下降来实现。 6. **更新模型和权重**：使用新的任务权重(w_i)计算总损失，然后进行反向传播更新模型参数。 #

1. 应用约束确保权重的正值 在训练过程中，可以对权重进行约束，以确保这些值始终为正。例如，可以通过对权重应用 \`torch.exp\` 操作来实现，因为 \`exp\` 函数的输出始终为正： \`\`\`python weight_raw = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.0)) # 初始化为0，这是原始权重参数 weight = torch.exp(weight_raw) #

2. 学习率设置不当 过高的学习率可能导致模型参数，包括用于控制损失权重占比的参数在训练过程中出现不稳定的更新，这可能是导致权重减小甚至变为负值的另一个原因。 # 解决方法： - 使用较低的学习率尝试训练。 - 对于权重参数，可能需要单独设置不同的（通常较小的）学习率。 # 3. 损失函数值的缩放不均 不同损失函数的值可能有非常不同的量级，可能会导致优化过程偏向于减小具有更大量级的损失函数的影响。这有可能通过减小其他损失权重的方式来实现，从而导致某些权重变得非常小或负。 # 解决方法： - 在计算总损失前手动缩放损失函数的值，使它们具有相似的量级。 - 重新考虑损失函数的设计，确保它们对模型训练的贡献是平衡的。 # 4. 模型过拟合或优化问题 如果模型过度优化了某些损失，可能会导致其他损失的相对重要性降低，从而使权重趋于零或负值。也有可能是损失函数之间存在竞争关系，导致模型优化进入一个不利于保持所有权重为正的状态。 # 解决方法： - 包含正则化项以减少过拟合的可能性。 - 重新考虑和评估不同损失之间的关系，确保它们在模型优化过程中能够协同工作。 #

单目深度估计 单目深度估计仅依赖于从单个相机拍摄的一张图像来预测场景的深度信息。这意味着它必须依赖图像中的一些线索（如纹理、透视信息、物体大小、已知形状等）来估计距离。单目深度估计对算法的要求较高，因为从单个图像中推断出3D信息比较复杂。近年来，深度学习的进展极大地推动了单目深度估计的性能，使得基于深度神经网络的方法能够在一定程度上准确地预测出深度图。 单目深度估计的一大优势是它只需要一个相机，这使得它更容易应用于那些只有单个摄像头的设备上，如普通的智能手机或部分自动驾驶车辆系统等。 # 双目深度估计 双目深度估计技术，相比之下，则是基于两个从稍微不同视角拍摄的图像（即双目相机系统）来估计深度的。通过比较左右两个视图中同一物体的位置差异（即视差），算法可以计算出每个像素点的深度信息。这种方法与人类的双眼视觉机制类似，相对于单目深度估计来说，理论上能提供更准确的深度信息。 双目深度估计的优点是，由于直接从物理视差中计算深度，因此在不涉及复杂场景理解的情况下通常可以得到较为准确的结果。然而，它也有局限性，例如需要两个精确校准的相机、可能在纹理较少的区域或重复纹理上遇到困难等。 # 总结 简而言之，单目与双目深度估计的主要区别在于输入图像的数量和它们各自推断深度信息的方法。单目方法仅需要一张图像，依赖图像内的线索来估计深度；而双目方法需要两张图像，通过计算视差来直接得到深度信息。单目方法的设备要求更低，适用性更广，但估计深度的准确性和鲁棒性往往不如双目方法。随着深度学习技术的不断进步，单目深度估计的准确性有显著提高，但仍在持续研究中寻求更优化的解决方案。"},{"prompt":"Schreibe mir den nachfolgenden Text neu ohne die entsprechenden Überschriften zu ändern:\\"H1: Interne Personalbeschaffung: Definition, Vorteile & Strategie [Einleitung] H2: Was versteht man unter interner Personalbeschaffung? Im Unterschied zur externen Personalbeschaffung, die sich am äußeren Arbeitsmarkt orientiert, geht es bei der internen Personalbeschaffung darum, vakante Stellen mit bereits im Unternehmen vorhandenen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern zu besetzen. Dabei kann zwischen der internen Personalbeschaffung mit oder ohne Personalbewegung unterschieden werden. H2: Welche Arten der internen Personalbeschaffung gibt es? H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung Hier verlassen die Mitarbeiter*innen ihren alten Arbeitsplatz, um im gleichen Unternehmen an einer vollkommen anderen Stelle anzufangen. Methoden für die entsprechende interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung sind: Interne Stellenanzeigen Aushang am schwarzen Brett E-Mail an sämtliche Mitarbeiter*innen Empfehlungen der vorgesetzten Personen, denn diese kennen die Mitarbeiter*innen gut und können ihre entsprechenden Stärken und Schwächen einschätzen Versetzungen Direktansprache Darüber hinaus spielen in diesem Bereich die Laufbahnplanung sowie Mitarbeiterentwicklung eine maßgebliche Rolle. Hierbei geht es darum, bereits frühzeitig innerhalb eines Unternehmens geeignete Mitarbeiter*innen mittels Qualifizierungen durch Weiter- und Fortbildungen, Zusatzausbildungen sowie Coachings für in Zukunft vakante Positionen auszubilden. H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung Die interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung zielt eher darauf ab, einen kurzfristigen Personalbedarf in einzelnen Unternehmensbereichen abzudecken. Das heißt, die Arbeitnehmer*innen behalten grundsätzlich ihre normale Stelle, werden jedoch vorübergehend anders eingesetzt. Methoden dazu sind zum einen die Veränderung der Urlaubsplanung, im Idealfall geschieht das in vorheriger Absprache mit der entsprechenden beschäftigten Person, und zum anderen der vorübergehend verstärkte Einsatz einer Mitarbeiterin oder eines Mitarbeiters. Hier baut die angestellte Person also für eine kurze Zeit Überstunden auf, die sie später wieder abbauen kann. H2: Welche Vorteile und Nachteile hat interne Personalbeschaffung? Dass die interne Personalbeschaffung sowohl mit einigen Vorteilen als auch mit einigen Nachteilen einhergeht, ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Der wohl größte Nachteil an der internen Personalrekrutierung ist, dass nur begrenzte personelle Ressourcen zur Verfügung stehen. Das bedeutet konkret: Ist unter der Belegschaft niemand mit den erforderlichen Qualifikationen oder Fähigkeiten zu finden, lässt sich die Stelle intern nicht besetzen. Bei der externen Rekrutierung ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, andere Kandidaten mit im Zweifel anderen oder besseren Qualifikationen ausfindig zu machen. Externes Recruiting ist jedoch mit dem Schalten von Stellenanzeigen, mit Vorstellungsgesprächen und weiteren zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen verbunden – kurzum: Es kostet Zeit und Geld. Wesentlich wirtschaftlicher erweist sich hierbei die interne Personalbeschaffung. Es ist nicht nötig, zahlreiche Bewerbungsgespräche zu führen, um dann herauszufinden, dass doch nicht der passende Kandidat an Bord ist. Bei der internen Rekrutierung geht das wesentlich schneller und einfacher. Und noch eine Stärke: Die Stammbelegschaft kennt in aller Regel bereits die Ansprechpartner und ist zudem mit der Unternehmenskultur und dem Leitbild der Firma vertraut. Vorteile Nachteile Kostengünstiger Rekrutierungskanal (Time-to-Hire sowie Einarbeitungszeit entfällt) Nur begrenzte Auswahl an passenden Kandidaten verfügbar Stammbelegschaft kennt Firmenstrukturen und Ansprechpartner Weniger Innovationskraft und „frisches“ Know-how Mögliche Aufstiegschancen steigern die Motivation der Mitarbeiter H2: 5 Schritte für eine erfolgreiche Interne Personalbeschaffung Damit die interne Personalbeschaffung das gewünschte Ergebnis bringt (eine offene Stelle wird schnell und kostengünstig mit einem Mitarbeiter besetzt, der das Unternehmen bereits kennt), empfiehlt sich eine Vorgehensweise in fünf Schritten: Schritt eins: Prüfen Sie zunächst, ob es ausreichend Mitarbeiter mit den gesuchten Qualifikationen im Unternehmen gibt, die für die Stelle in Frage kommen könnten. Schritt zwei: Erstellen Sie eine aussagekräftige Stellenausschreibung und kommunizieren Sie diese über die relevanten firmeninternen Kanäle. Schritt drei: Sichten Sie die eingehenden internen Bewerbungen, sprechen Sie mit den jeweiligen Vorgesetzten und klären Sie, ob eventuell fehlende Kompetenzen durch kurzfristige Personalentwicklungs-Maßnahmen aufgebaut werden können. Schritt vier: Prüfen Sie, ob durch den Wechsel des in Frage kommenden Mitarbeiters weiterer Rekrutierungsbedarf entsteht und wie aufwendig diese Stellenbesetzung sein wird. Schritt fünf: Vergessen Sie das Onboarding nicht. Ein Mitarbeiter, der intern seine Stelle wechselt, benötigt zwar keine Einführung in die Unternehmenskultur. Aber auch bei einem internen Wechsel sind Onboarding-Gespräche mit der neuen Führungskraft sehr sinnvoll. H2: Fazit: Interne und externe Rekrutierungskanäle nutzen Wie bereits beschrieben, kann die interne Personalbeschaffung einiges leisten – sie ist kostengünstig und erweist sich auch im Hinblick auf die Motivation der Mitarbeiter als sinnvoll. Dennoch – und das ist das größte Manko – stehen nicht unbegrenzt personelle Ressourcen im eigenen Unternehmen bereit. Es ist also ratsam, auf einen ausgewogenen Mix von externen und internen Rekrutierungsmöglichkeiten zu setzen. Gerade was den Kompetenzgewinn im eigenen Unternehmen angeht, sollten Sie auf fachliche versierte Personen von außen setzen – die das Potenzial haben, frischen Wind ins eigene Unternehmen zu bringen. Wer nur unter seinesgleichen verharrt, könnte schnell betriebsblind werden. Eine Gefahr, die in jedem Fall unterbunden werden muss! \\".

Jedoch besitzen sie als Staatsbürger der Republik Südafrika zum Ausgleich ein kostbares Allgemeingut: den Rechtsstaat. Und das ist der ausschlaggebende Gesichtspunkt”. (Frankfurter Rundschau, 23. Oktober 1976: „Aufgespießt”). Vorbemerkung Auf einer Tagung über „Ausnahmegesetze und Staatskrise im fortgeschrittenen Kapitalismus”, die 1978 an der Universität Ca-merino stattfand, setzte man sich engagiert und sehr offen mit dem Problem der Bürgerrechte und ihrer vom Staat garantierten Verwirklichung (dem sogenannten Garantismus) auseinander - beides als konstitutive Elemente des Rechtsstaats verstanden. Der Rechtsstaat selbst wurde auf eine Weise gewürdigt, die meines Erachtens Ergebnisse und konkrete Erscheinungen der historisch-politischen Entwicklung außer achtließ. Er wurde als Ideal dargestellt, das es zu retten oder wiederherzustellen oder endlich in die Praxis umzusetzen gelte. Es schien mir bedenklich, daß solche anerkannten Wissenschaftler wie Federico Stame und Luigi Ferrajoli aus einem durchaus verständlichen, von mir übrigens gänzlich geteilten Bestreben nach Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit, in ein quid pro quo gerieten und eine dem Prinzip nach richtige, aber in der Wirklichkeit nicht vorhandene Institution mit den Strukturen und den tatsächlichen Machtinstrumenten verwechselten, die die Gesellschaft im modernen bürgerlichen Staat als dem real existierenden Rechtsstaat zusammenfassen. Das heißt, sie bezeichnen etwas als Krise, die es zu beheben und abzuwenden gelte, was wahrscheinlich nur die einfache logische Entfaltung eines bestimmten, der kapitalistischen Ökonomie verbundenen Typus von Politik darstellt. Und dies, obwohl beide die inhärenten Widersprüche einer rechtlichen Institutionalisierung des Staatsschutzes durchaus eingesehen hatten: Stame mit Rekurs auf Ulrich Preuss und dessen kritische Analyse des Verhältnisses zwischen subjektivem Recht und objektivem Staatsrecht; Ferrajoli mit seinen präzisen Hinweisen auf die Wirklichkeit des deutschen Rechtsstaats, der in den bloßen Gesetzesstaat ausläuft. Nach Ferrajoli scheint eine solche allgemeine Verrechtlichung die deutsche Version der Krise des Rechtsstaats darzustellen. Meiner Ansicht nach liegt gerade in der ins Politische übersetzten Vorherrschaft der Form Recht die Eigentümlichkeit des Problems. Aktualisierend stelle ich hier meine Sicht der Dinge erneut zur Diskussion. Die angesprochenen Fragen betreffen ohnehin die italienische Gesellschaft in immer größerem Maße. Sie werden aufs Tapet gebracht von den Befürwortern weitreichender materieller und Verfassungsreformen, die den italienischen Staat endlich an die spätkapitalistische Entwicklungsstufe anpassen sollen. Ist aber heute der Kapitalismus „spät” oder „reif” oder „fortgeschritten”? Ich würde hieraus weder eine Frage des Prinzips noch eine der politschen Philologie machen. Der Ausdruck „fortgeschritten” scheint mir nur geprägt worden zu sein, um die Entfernung zu einem irgendwie rückständigen Kapitalismus zu fassen. Oder er bezeichnet einfach ein anderes Akkumulationsniveau, ohne vorgängige Bewertung. Die beiden anderen Ausdrücke sind parteilich und doppeldeutig. „Reif” unterstellt eine positive Gültigkeit und Effizienz, könnte aber auch den Niedergang meinen. Das „spät” weist offenkundig auf eine Endphase hin (und wird deshalb von mir gewählt), ohne jedoch brauchbare Indikatoren ihrer Dauer und Entwicklung zu liefern. Einige Bemerkungen über Recht und Macht Ob als Rechtsstaat oder nicht, immer übersetzt der Staat den objektiven Zwangscharakter der gesellschaftlichen Reproduktion in politische Form.1 In Zeiten von Krise und sozialer Unruhe tritt dies krude und unverbrämt zu Tage; es zeigt sich darüberhinaus in den Präventivstrategien, die darauf gerichtet sind, die Krise einzudämmen oder besser zu verwalten. Aber es gilt auch für den „Normalfall\\" einer friedlichen und befriedeten Reproduktion, die innerhalb und vermittels der Institutionen vor sich geht: der Staat besitzt in jedem Fall das Monopol der legitimierten Gewaltausübung (das Webersche Gewaltmonopol) und überträgt auf seine öffentlichen Handlungen sein eigenes spezifisches Merkmal, rechtlich zu handeln. In den sogenannten Zivilgesellschaften hat keine andere Instanz die Macht, die Möglichkeit und die Erlaubnis, durch Anwendung von Gewalt zum Gehorsam zu zwingen (Max Weber), ohne sich ins Abseits aller Regeln des Zusammenlebens zu stellen und einfach eine Verbrecherbande zu bilden; sie erleidet dabei weder Verlust noch Beeinträchtigung der ihr zugeschriebenen Qualität, ein „kostbares Allgemeingut\\" (Deutsche Tagespost) zu sein, sondern sie reklamiert im Gegenteil: „Es liegt im Wesen des Rechtsstaats, daß der Staat die ausschließliche Berechtigung zur Gewaltanwendung besitzt\\". So Genscher anläßlich von Straßendemonstrationen und ähnlichen Aktionen.2 Womit wir bei unserem zentralen Problem wären. Die Legitimitätskriterien der Macht sollen hier aber in einem anderen Licht gesehen werden. Es stellt sich nicht so sehr die normative Frage, ob und aus welchem Gründen (historischen, demokratischen, moralischen oder einfach bürokratisch-funktionalen) der Staat die Legitimation besitzt, seine Macht (die konstitutionelle „Staatsgewalt\\") auch mit den Mitteln der Gewalt (mit gewalttätigen Mitteln) zu entfalten - gleichgültig, ob gegen Terroristen, Umstürzler oder Steuerhinterzieher. Das Problem zeigt sich eher in seiner Befugnis, die Gewaltanwendung prozedural zu gründen: ob er das Recht der Gewaltanwendung erwirbt und überdies das Vorrecht dazu erhält, sie in eine gewöhnliche Verwaltungsmaßnahme (also diesseits allen Ausnahmezustands) zu verwandeln, bloß weil er sich an genau bestimmte, kodifizierte Regeln, an legale und legalisierende Vorgehensweisen hält: also an die Korrektheit des Verfahrens als letzten Grund der Legitimität (Luhmann). Dar aus ergäbe sich die Möglichkeit, durch einfache Reformen im Verfahren eine neue Stufe der Legitimität zu erreichen; oder in Grenzfällen sich die Legitimität nachträglich zu besorgen. Wenn - objektivistisch gesagt - das staatliche Handeln der insti tutionellen Reform vorauseilt, kann die vorübergehend suspen dierte Normativität wieder herbeigeführt werden durch eine Neufassung der nunmehr der Praxis angeglichenen Norm. Hier für bietet uns die Bundesrepublik Deutschland ein bezeichnen des Beispiel. Nach der Ermordung des Arbeitgeberpräsidenten Schleyer verbot das Bundeskriminalamt jeden Kontakt zwi schen den Angeklagten und ihren Anwälten, ohne hierfür eine verfassungsadäquate Grundlage zu haben. Der Protest blieb spo radisch, dennoch herrschte in der öffentlichen Meinung eine ge wisse Ratlosigkeit. Doch der Bundestag beeilte sich, in kürzester Zeit eine entsprechende Gesetzesvorlage zu verabschieden und so genau jene Rechtsstaatlichkeit zu rekonstruieren, die an ei nem Lebensnerv verletzt war. Eine solche Methode ist durchaus von Vorteil, und zwar nicht nur für die Macht. Wenn man unterstellt, daß die deutsche Praxis die Gefahr von bloßen Ermessens- oder Willkürmaßnahmen ver ringert, ja sogar eliminiert, und den polizeilichen und gerichtli chen Handlungsspielraum einschränkt, so könnte man mit Ferra- joli sagen, daß der Rechtsstaat in Deutschland sich zusätzlich gefestigt habe. Dabei wäre allerdings zu präzisieren, daß hierin weniger die subjektiven Rechte umfassendere Gültigkeit und Bestätigung finden, als vielmehr der Staat selber. Die Form Staat festigt sich, indem sie ihre legalistische Ausgestaltung be stätigt; und sie legitimiert sich durch die gewissenhafte Befol gung der verfaßten Strukturen (Legitimität durch Verfahren), die von Fall zu Fall nach dem Opportunitätsprinzip erneuert und „reformiert” werden. Dies ist gleichwohl etwas anderes als die formale Transformation des Rechtsstaats, die (wenn ich Stame richtig verstanden habe) eine bestimmte Form der Anpas sung der Spielregeln an neue techno¬politische Erfordernisse mit sich bringen soll; wobei der spezifische Inhalt: die Rechtsgaran tien unversehrt blieben. So gesehen, stellte die Änderung des Verfahrens in der Machtausübung einen erweiterten Schutz des Rechts in Zeiten der Krise dar.”翻译为中文","completion":"从克莱门斯·纳赫特曼的意大利语版本 晚期资本主义中的法治国家和德国经验 摘自《德国日报》：“南非的黑人并没有完全获得选举权，而且受到每一个坚定的民主主义者都会遗憾和谴责的歧视形式的制约。然而，作为南非共和国的公民，他们作为补偿拥有一项宝贵的公共财富：法治国家。这是决定性的观点。”（《法兰克福汇报》，1976年10月23日：“批评”）。 前言 在1978年于卡梅里诺大学举行的关于“先进资本主义中的紧急法令和国家危机”的会议上，与会者投入并非常开放地讨论了公民权利及其由国家保障实现（所谓的担保主义）的问题 - 两者都被理解为法治国家的构成要素。法治国家本身以一种我认为忽略了历史政治发展的结果和具体现象的方式得到了赞扬。它被描绘成一个需要被拯救、恢复或最终实践的理想。我觉得令人担忧的是，像费德里科·斯塔梅和路易吉·费拉乔利这样的公认学者，出于一种我全然赞同的对自由和正义的追求，陷入了一种误解，将原则上正确但在现实中不存在的机构与现代资产阶级国家中真实存在的法治国家概括起来的社会结构和实际权力工具混为一谈。也就是说，他们将某些可能只是与资本主义经济相连的特定政治类型的简单逻辑展开，称之为危机，认为这是需要解决和避免的，尽管两人都清楚地看到了法律机构化的国家保护的固有矛盾：斯塔梅通过引用乌尔里希·普劳斯及其对主观权利与客观国家法之间关系的批判性分析；费拉乔利则通过对德国法治国家实际情况的精确指出，该国家归结为仅仅是法制国家。根据费拉乔利的看法，这种普遍的法律化似乎表现为法治国家危机的德国版本。在我看来，问题的特点正是法律形式的政治优势。 更新我的观点，我在此重新提出我的看法以供讨论。所提及的问题无疑越来越多地关系到意大利社会。它们被提出来，由那些倡导全面的物质和宪法改革的支持者，这些改革旨在最终将意大利国家调整至晚期资本主义发展阶段。 但今天的资本主义是“晚期”的、还是“成熟”的或“先进”的？我不会把这看作是一个原则问题或政治哲学问题。表达“先进”似乎只是为了抓住与某种方式上落后的资本主义的距离。或者它只是简单地指另一个积累水平，不带有先前的评价。其他两个表达方式是有偏见且模棱两可的。“成熟”暗示了一种积极的有效性和效率，但也可能意味着衰落。“晚期”显然指向一个终结阶段（因此是我的选择），但不提供其持续时间和发展的可靠指标。 关于法律和权力的一些评论 无论是作为法治国家还是以其他形式，国家总是将社会再生产的客观强制性转化为政治形式。在危机和社会动荡时期，这一点裸露无遗；它还体现在旨在遏制危机或更好地管理危机的预防策略中。但这同样适用于在和平与安定的“正常情况”下，通过制度的介入和调解进行的再生产：在任何情况下，国家都拥有合法使用暴力的垄断权（马克斯·韦伯的暴力垄断），并将其自身的特定特征，即合法行为，转移到其公共行动上。在所谓的文明社会中，没有其他实体拥有权力、可能性和许可，通过使用暴力强制服从（马克斯·韦伯），而不是将自己置于所有共同生活规则之外，简单地形成一个犯罪团伙；在这一过程中，它并没有失去或损害其被赋予的“宝贵公共财物”（《德国日报》）的品质，相反，它声称：“法治国家的本质在于，国家拥有使用暴力的专属权利”。正如根舍尔在街头示威和类似行动中所说。这就引出了我们的中心问题。但这里的权力合法性标准将以不同的光线来看待。 问题并不是规范性地质疑国家是否因历史、民主、道德或仅是官僚功能性的原因拥有合法性、使用其权力（宪法“国家权力”）通过暴力手段（使用暴力手段）来施展力量的问题 - 无论是针对恐怖分子、颠覆者还是逃税者。问题更多体现在它授权使用暴力的程序性基础上：是否国家获得了使用暴力的权利，并且还获得了将其转化为常规行政措施（即在所有紧急状态之外）的特权，仅仅因为它遵循了具体规定的、编码的规则，遵循合法和合法化的程序：即程序的正确性为合法性的最终依据（卢曼）。由此可能通过简单的程序改革达到新的合法性水平；或在极端情况下，事后获取合法性。如果 - 从客观主义角度说 - 国家行为超前于制度改革，那么暂时悬挂的规范性可以通过修订现在与实践相符的规范而再次引入。德国联邦共和国为我们提供了一个有代表性的例子。在雇主协会主席Schleyer被杀后，联邦刑事局禁止了被告与律师之间的任何联系，尽管这没有一个与宪法相符的基础。尽管抗议零星，但公众舆论中仍存在某种困惑。然而，联邦议会急忙通过了相应的法律草案，并迅速重建了受到生命线伤害的法治国家的合法性。这种方法无疑是有利的，不仅对权力机构而言。如果假设德国的做法降低了仅仅是自由裁量或任意行为的风险，甚至限制了警察和法院的行动范围，那么可以与费拉乔利一同说，德国的法治国家得到了额外的巩固。不过，应当指出，这里的含义并不是主观权利获得了更广泛的有效性和确认，而是国家本身。国家形式通过确认其合法主义的架构而得到巩固；并通过严格遵循规定的结构（程序性合法性）来合法化自身，这些结构根据机会原则不时被更新和“改革”。这与法治国家的形式转变有所不同，后者（如果我正确理解了斯塔梅）应当带来一种适应新的技术政治要求的规则调整的特定形式；而其中的具体内容：即法律保障仍然保持完整。因此，从权力行使中的程序变化来看，这代表了危机时期对法律的扩展保护。"},{"prompt":"请将“Leider bewegt sich der reale Prozeß in ganz anderen Bahnen. Werden die Strukturen von Regierung und Verwaltung modernisiert und der Entscheidungsapparat gestärkt, so verändert der Staat seinen Inhalt, ohne Wechsel oder Verlust der Rechtsförmigkeit. Er läßt jenen verfallen, um diese im höchsten Maße zu steigern. Sie setzt sich schließlich als das eigene Recht des Staats durch. Die Stärkung, auf die Ferrajoli hinwies, vollzieht sich also auf einer politischen Machtebene, die die konstitutionellen Normen nicht überschreitet: der Staat bleibt Rechtsstaat. Und wenn das obrigkeitliche Ermessen fortbesteht, so artikuliert es sich sicherlich nicht als Durchbrechung der Schranken und als Riß im Ordnungsgefüge, sondern genau als die Erneuerung des gesetzlichen Daches, die immer im Bereich der vorgesehenen Regeln vor sich geht. Keine noch so einschneidende Veränderung des Verfahrens kann diesen Rahmen sprengen. Ich komme später mit einem Beispiel aus der deutschen Erfahrung auf dieses Thema zurück. Um aber Mißverständnisse zu vermeiden, sei vorerst unterstrichen, daß alle Maßnahmen und Anordnungen, die die Bundesregierung oder die einzelnen Länderregierungen treffen, wie verhängnisvoll sie sich auch für die Freiheit auswirken mögen, nicht nur in der Macht, sondern ebensosehr im Recht gründen. Auf den ersten Blick scheint es sich um eine rein terminologische Unterscheidung zu handeln: was die italienischen „Ga-rantisten” unter Rechtsstaat verstehen, deckt sich nicht mit dem real existierenden Rechtsstaat; oder um eine Unterscheidung geschichtlichen Charakters, bedingt durch die anders verlaufene soziale und ökonomische Entwicklung Deutschlands, die eine andere Art von Normenverständnis hervorgebracht haben könnte - ein bekanntes Faktum, das gewiß berücksichtigt werden muß. Die Unstimmigkeit könnte sich also nur als das gewöhnliche Mißverständnis historischer Analogien herausstellen. Jede Vergleichbarkeit zwischen Italien (einem bekanntermaßen liberalen, demokratischen Land ohne autoritäre Versuchungen und sozusagen ohne eine faschistische Vergangenheit) und Deutschland, welches ist, wie es ist, verböte sich also von selbst. Nun liegt hier keineswegs ein Mißverständnis vor. Die Unstimmigkeit ist das gut begründete Resultat einer unterschiedlichen Bewertung der Geschichte. Das will heißen: wenn von deutschen Erfahrungen gesprochen wird, in Wirklichkeit „de italicis rebus fabula narratur”. Sicherlich haben wir es mit zwei historisch verschiedenen Formationen zu tun, da die Akkumulationsstufe des Kapitals, die Klassenentwicklung und die Bildung der entsprechenden politischen Form anders sind. Aber auch die italienische Gesellschaft entwickelt sich zur kapitalistischen „Reife” hin. Die Geschichte kennt ohnehin keine substanziellen (oder gar ethnischen) Unterschiede, sondern nur die Übersetzung der fortschreitenden Stadien in die ökonomische, gesellschaftliche und politische Sprache schon gefestigter Produktions- und Reproduktionsverhältnisse.3 Fassen wir das Problem zusammen. Hat der Rechtsstaat, der in den Gesellschaften der Gegenwart die Form der verfassungsmäßigen Ordnung annimmt, in all seinen Varianten eine gemeinsame Grundlage in der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise und in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft; oder behauptet er sich als institutionelles System, das seine eigene ökonomische und gesellschaftliche Basis transzendiert, seine universale Norm durchsetzt und sich nicht in den Dienst irgendwelcher Gruppen oder Klassen stellen läßt? Gehen wir zum „Fall” Italien über. Wird sich die italienische bürgerliche Gesellschaft (nicht die sogenannte Zivilgesellschaft) auf der Grundlage spätkapitalistischer Akkumulation entwickeln, ohne daß ein Zusammenprall von (subjektivem) Recht und (objektiver) Macht stattfände; ließe sich somit die Staatlichkeit aus der sozio-ökonomischen Formation heraushalten und eine Art demokratischer Verfassungsstaat verwirklichen - gewissermaßen ein Staat von Allen und für Alle, eben der Staat als Rechtsgarant? In diesem Punkt scheint mir die garantistische Perspektive „Ideal und Leben” (frei nach Friedrich Schiller) zu verwechseln und einen Staat vorauszusetzen, der nicht nur Klassen- und Gruppeninteressen ausgleicht, sondern in voller Unabhängigkeit von der Ökonomie über den gesellschaftlichen Widersprüchen steht. Die Frage läßt sich noch einfacher und provokatorischer fassen. Ist der real existierende Rechtsstaat wirklich eine ewige, nicht an bestimmte historische Bedingungen gebundene Errungenschaft der Menschheit? Bedeutet er ein endgültig erreichtes Ziel jenseits aller Brüche, also die siegreiche Idee auf dem Weg zu immer höheren Zivilisationsstufen; oder verkörpert er ein spezifisches Instrument bürgerlicher Macht, fraglos mit humanen Elementen und unverzichtbaren Institutionen ausgestattet, die leider in ein gesellschaftliches Produktionsverhältnis und ein organisatorisches System eingekeilt sind, das die subjektiven Rechte nur insoweit schützt und garantiert, wie dies dem Schutz des Kapitalismus funktional ist? Solche Streitfragen, Schwierigkeiten und Probleme übersteigen die zufällige Dimension dieser oder jener national begrenzten Gesellschaft. Und sie betreffen nicht länger die Verteidi-gung von Bürgerrechten gegen die Erweiterung der politischen und die Willkür der ökonomischen Macht, sondern die „garantierende” Natur des Staats selbst. Der vermutlich nicht mehr der Staat ist, dem man die Verteidigung seiner Rechte überlassen soll und dem man wirklich trauen kann. Gründe zu zweifeln gibt es genug. Sei es in der deutschen Erfahrung des Legalismus, sei es in der italienischen des Gewäh-renlassens und der politischen Machtparzellierung verflechtet sich das Prinzip des Gewaltmonopols mit den vielfältigen Problemen der politischen Gewaltanwendung, die keineswegs unparteilich ist. Sie konkretisiert sich in Standpunkten und Handlungsanweisungen, die durch eine klar bestimmte und klar erkennbare Strategie den Status quo konsolidieren - und dabei immer die Gültigkeit des Rechtsstaats beteuern. Nehmen wir dennoch an, der Staat sei Rechtsgarant. Bedeutet ein solches Attribut in der Wirklichkeit die Garantie einer Freiheit, die auch und vor allem als Befreiungsprozeß begriffen wird und sich gegen konstituierte Machtpositionen, gegen die verallgemeinerte Warenform und die Allgemeinheit des Tausches, gegen die Subsumtion des Menschen unter entfremdete, aufgezwungene Zweckbestimmtheit wendet; oder manifestiert es sich schlicht und brutal als Garantie der Klassenherrschaft? Eine paradoxe Gegenüberstellung: der Staat bleibt so oder so in der Tat Rechtsgarant. Auch wenn die Positionen umgekehrt werden, bleibt es eine vexata quaestio. Gegenüber einem System der Klassenherrschaft schiene die Verteidigung von Bürgerrechten und mit ihr der Rekurs auf den Rechtsstaat zu einer emanzipatorischen Strategie zu gehören, die die Klassengegenmacht meint. Ich nehme an, daß sich hier die Position Ferrajolis verorten läßt, d. h. der Entwurf eines Bruchs, der über den bekannten „alternativen Gebrauch” der Verfassung und über die freie Verfügbarkeit bürgerlicher Institutionen hinausreichte. Der alternative Gebrauch bleibt bekanntlich im Bereich bloßer Reformen und der Anpassung befangen, vermutlich auch der Modernisierung und Auffrischung von Apparaten und Verfahren, die in der kapitalistischen Entwicklung disfunktional geworden sind (generell die sozialdemokratischen Vorschläge). Der - sagen wir es ruhig - revolutionäre Gebrauch hingegen gälte einem qualitativen Sprung: er verfügte über eine bürgerliche Errungenschaft (um die es sich, historisch gesehen, handelt) zugunsten eines Subjekts, das die bürgerliche Gesellschaft abschaffen und eine andere aufbauen will. Hic Rhodus, hic saltus. Das braucht den hohen Wert der Menschenrechte nicht zu schmälern, noch die damit verbundene soziale Sicherheit und Annehmlichkeit. Was bedeutet in diesem Kontext die „Krise des Rechtsstaats”? Gerät er in die Krise, weil er seine Aufgabe nicht mehr erfüllen kann; oder weil er auf die Probleme eines Kapitalismus stößt, der ihn schon längst instrumentalisiert; oder schließlich, weil die politsche wie auch die herrschende Klasse (im Marx-schen Sinne des Wortes) seinen eigentlichen Sinn entstellt und, unbekümmert um die Erhaltung der Normen, entschlossen auf Ausnahmelösungen und Notstandserklärungen zusteuert?”翻译为中文","completion":"不幸的是，现实过程走的是完全不同的道路。当政府和行政结构现代化并加强决策机构时，国家改变了其内容，而无需改变或损失其法律形式。它放弃了前者以最大程度地增强后者。最终，这变成了国家自身的权利。 因此，费拉乔利所指的加强发生在不超越宪法规范的政治权力层面上：国家依然是法治国家。而当权威性的自由裁量权存在时，它肯定不是作为对界限的突破和秩序结构的裂缝，而是作为法规框架更新的具体表现，这种更新始终发生在预设规则的范围内。任何对程序的重大变更都无法突破这一框架。关于这个主题，我将以德国的经验为例返回。但为了避免误解，首先强调，联邦政府或各邦政府采取的所有措施和命令，无论它们对自由产生多么灾难性的影响，都是基于权力，同样也基于法律。 乍一看，这似乎是一个纯粹的术语区别：意大利的“保障派”对法治国家的理解，与现实存在的法治国家不一致；或者说这是一个历史上的区别，由于德国的社会和经济发展不同，可能产生了不同种类的规范理解——这是一个众所周知的事实，必须考虑在内。因此，这种不一致可能只是历史类比的常见误解。意大利（一个众所周知的自由民主国家，没有权威主义的诱惑，可以说没有法西斯主义的过去）与德国之间的任何可比性自然是禁止的。但这里绝不是一个误解。这种不一致是对历史评价不同的有根据的结果。这意味着：当谈到德国的经验时，实际上是“关于意大利事务的故事”。当然，我们面对的是两个历史上不同的形态，因为资本的积累阶段、阶级发展和相应的政治形式不同。但意大利社会也在向资本主义的“成熟”发展。历史无论如何都不认识任何实质性（甚至是种族）的差异，只是将前进的阶段翻译成已经确立的生产和再生产关系的经济、社会和政治语言。 让我们总结一下问题。在当今社会，作为宪法秩序形式的法治国家，是否在所有变体中都基于资本主义生产方式和资产阶级社会；或者它作为一个机构体系，超越了自己的经济和社会基础，推行了它的普遍规范，不为任何团体或阶级服务？我们继续讨论“意大利案例”。意大利资产阶级社会（不是所谓的公民社会）会在晚期资本主义积累的基础上发展，没有（主观的）权利和（客观的）权力之间的冲突；因此，是否可以排除国家性质的另一种民主宪政国家的实现——某种意义上是一个属于所有人并为所有人服务的国家，即作为法律保障的国家？在这一点上，保障派的视角似乎将“理想与生活”（借用弗里德里希·席勒的说法）混为一谈，预设了一个不仅协调阶级和团体利益，而且完全独立于经济，高于社会矛盾的国家。问题可以更简单、更具挑衅性地提出。现实存在的法治国家真的是人类的一个永恒成就，不受特定历史条件的限制吗？它意味着超越所有断裂达到的最终目标，即通往更高文明阶段的胜利思想；或者它代表了一种特定的资产阶级权力工具，无疑配备了人性元素和不可或缺的机构，遗憾的是它被嵌入到一个旨在保护资本主义功能的社会生产关系和组织体系中，只在这对资本主义保护有功能性保障时才保护和保障个人权利？ 这些争议、困难和问题超越了这个或那个特定国家社会的偶然维度。它们不再仅仅关于保护公民权利以对抗政治权力的扩张和经济权力的任意性，而是关于国家自身的“保障”本质。这或许已经不再是一个值得将权利防卫委托给并可以真正信任的国家了。 有足够的理由持怀疑态度。无论是在德国的法律主义经验中，还是在意大利的放任和政治权力分割的经验中，暴力垄断的原则与政治暴力使用的多样化问题交织在一起，这些问题绝非公正。它具体化为通过明确和可识别的策略巩固现状的立场和行动指导，同时总是声称维护法治国家的有效性。然而，假设国家是法律的保障者。在现实中，这样的属性是否确实保障了自由，这种自由不仅被理解为解放过程，抵抗对权力地位的树立，反对商品化普遍性和交换的一般性，反对人类受到压迫的、被强加的目的性的从属；或者它仅仅和粗暴地表现为阶级统治的保障？ 一个悖论的对立：不论如何，国家确实以某种方式保持为法律的保障者。 即使立场相反，这也是一个令人烦恼的问题。面对一个阶级统治的制度，保卫公民权利以及诉诸法治国家似乎属于一种解放策略，意味着支持阶级反抗力量。 我假设这里是费拉乔利的立场所在，也就是超越众所周知的宪法“另类使用”和对公民机构自由使用的方案之外的一种突破。众所周知，另类使用仍然局限在单纯改革和调整范围内，可能还包括现代化和刷新在资本主义发展中变得不再功能性的设备和程序（一般来说是社会民主主义的提案）。然而，敢于说，革命性的使用意味着质的飞跃：它利用民间成就（从历史上看，这是它的性质）服务于一个意图废除资产阶级社会并建立一个不同的主体。这是关键所在。这并不意味着贬低人权的高价值，也不意味着减少与之相关的社会安全和舒适。 在这个背景下，“法治国家的危机”意味着什么？它之所以陷入危机，是因为它不再能够履行其职责；还是因为它遇到了早已将其工具化的资本主义的问题；或者最终，是因为政治和统治阶级（以马克思主义的意义）扭曲了它的本来意义，并且不顾规范的保持，决心采取例外解决方案和紧急声明？"},{"prompt":"Donne-moi l’histoire d’une jeune femme qui peu de temps après une hypnothérapie pour calmer ses crises d'angoisse qui a porté ses fruits se met à ressentir du plaisir sexuel dès qu’une femme la traite mal.

La séance, étrangement efficace, avait cependant laissé derrière elle une conséquence inattendue. Désormais, chaque fois qu’une femme la traitait mal, Marie ressentait une excitation sexuelle incontrôlable. La méchanceté amplifiait son désir, transformant chaque confrontation en une séance d'excitation personnelle indésirable. Son mariage avec Lou, sa compagne de 29 ans, avait souffert de cette négligence progressive, leur intimité déjà sur la corde raide se retrouvant encore plus éprouvée. Lou, absorbée par sa carrière, était souvent distante, mais jamais dans le sens qui nourrissait le nouveau penchant de Marie. Cette distance émotionnelle avait poussé Marie à chercher ailleurs ce mélange toxique de rejet et de désir. Incapable de résister à cette pulsion, Marie se lança dans un cercle vicieux, courtisant consciemment des femmes réputées pour leurs tempéraments odieux. Chaque aventure, aussi destructrice fût-elle, ne faisait qu'attiser la flamme de cette addiction étrange. Nina, connue dans les cercles sociaux pour sa capacité à humilier ceux qui croisaient son chemin, était devenue l'obsession de Marie. Leur liaison, basée sur un cycle incessant de dédain et d’intimité, la poussait à se mépriser tout en recherchant sa prochaine 'dose' de cruauté. Paradoxalement, cette quête de l’abîme frôlait la communication dans son union avec Lou. Elle tentait de provoquer chez Lou une réaction, un semblant de jalousie ou d’irritation qui pourrait, espérait-elle inconsciemment, allumer la même étincelle. Mais Lou, perdue dans ses propres tourments et responsabilités, restait aveugle à ces tentatives désespérées, accentuant encore l’isolement de Marie. Les rencontres de Marie avec ses conquêtes étaient teintées d’un cocktail toxique de plaisir et de mépris de soi. Chaque insulte, chaque regard de dédain alimentait son désir d'une manière qu'elle ne comprenait pas pleinement. Ses escapades la conduisaient dans les bras de Paula, une femme impitoyable qui prenait un malin plaisir à la dévaloriser. Le cycle de honte et d'excitation semblait sans fin. Marie, tombant toujours plus bas, ne pouvait ignorer la douleur qu'elle infligeait à Lou et à elle-même. Chaque aventure laisse une cicatrice, une marque indélébile de sa quête destructrice d'amour et d'approbation sous les traits de la cruauté. Mais c'est dans cet abîme qu'elle recherche sa vérité, défiant les normes et découvrant les sombres facettes de son désir. Comme pris dans un tourbillon, Marie poursuit sa quête, laissant derrière elle un sillage de cœurs brisés, y compris le sien."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi la suite de l'histoire où Marie comprend qu'en réalité la thérapie a mis fin à la source de ses angoisses, qui était de ne pas oser s'accepter elle-même pour ce qu'elle est et voulait; une jeune femme voulant vivre sous le joug d'une matrone sévère et tyrannique qui serait sa maîtresse et son grand amour. Et plus elle passe de temps avec Paula, plus Marie réalise que c'est la (méchante) femme de sa vie qu'elle espérait depuis toujours. Donne-moi la réponse la plus longue possible, en français.","completion":"Avec le temps, un déclic se produit dans l'esprit tourmenté de Marie. La thérapie, qu'elle avait d'abord pensée comme le déclencheur de son étrange condition, se révélait plutôt avoir dévoilé un aspect profondément enfoui de sa personnalité. Ses angoisses, qui la paralysaient depuis des années, étaient en fait alimentées par une peur viscérale d'affronter sa propre essence. Elle comprenait maintenant que ce n'était pas la méchanceté en tant que telle qui l'attirait, mais plutôt le besoin viscéral d'être guidée, corrigée, et aimée avec rigueur. C'était dans le regard acéré et dans les paroles tranchantes de Paula qu'elle trouvait ce mélange rassurant de structure et d'affection. Plus elle passait de temps avec Paula, plus elle comprenait que ses sentiments n'étaient pas motivés par une recherche de douleur, mais par le désir profond de vivre sous la coupe d'une personne à la fois sévère et protectrice. Paula, malgré ses abords impitoyables, révélait par moments une tendresse insoupçonnée, un soin attentif caché derrière ses exigences. C'était cette dualité qui captivait Marie, la faisant réaliser que ce qu'elle cherchait n'était pas une relation basée sur le mépris, mais une connexion profonde, complexe, où dominance et soumission se mélangeaient avec amour et respect. Leurs moments intimes, bien que souvent initiés par des échanges cruels, finissaient par révéler une intimité et une compréhension mutuelle que Marie n’avait jamais connues. Chaque mot dur, chaque critique de Paula semblait pousser Marie à s'améliorer, à être plus elle-même, dévoilant peu à peu la force tranquille qu'elle portait en elle. Marie commençait à percevoir cette dynamique non comme une spirale de destruction, mais comme une forme de libération. L'acceptation de ce désir, longtemps refoulé, d'être sous l'aile d'une personnalité forte et exigeante, était en fait ce qui la libérait de ses angoisses. Elle ne cherchait plus à être dévalorisée, mais plutôt guidée et aimée d'une manière qui lui était spécifique. L'aveu de cette réalisation à Lou fut le moment le plus difficile. L'honnêteté brutale avec laquelle Marie exposa ses besoins, ses désirs, et l'amour profond mais différent qu'elle éprouvait toujours pour Lou, marqua un tournant. Bien que le cœur de Lou fut brisé par ces révélations, elle comprit que l'amour prend de multiples formes, et que parfois, laisser partir est l'acte d'amour le plus pur. Le chemin vers cette acceptation de soi ne fut pas facile pour Marie. Il fut ponctué de doutes, de peur de la solitude, et de l'angoisse de ne jamais être pleinement comprise ou acceptée. Mais avec Paula, elle trouva une étrange paix dans la tourmente, une stabilité dans l'instabilité. Marie réalisa enfin que ce n'étaient pas les femmes méchantes qui l'excitaient, mais la recherche d'un type de connexion et d'affection qui lui convenait, incarné parfaitement par Paula. Dans cette harmonie complexe de dureté et de tendresse, Marie découvrit la puissance de s’accepter pleinement, révéler sa vraie nature et vivre selon ses propres termes."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi la discussion de quatre femmes amies de longues dates dont deux d'entre elles (la quarantaine) sont un couple marié.

La complexité des relations humaines exige une approche délicate. Ainsi, le narratif ci-dessous cherchera à explorer cette configuration délicate avec prudence et respect pour toutes les parties concernées. --- Les verres cliquettent doucement sur la table du salon, alors que quatre amies se retrouvent pour leur soirée mensuelle. Autour de la table, l’atmosphère semble légère, mais les sous-entendus tissent une toile complexe. Sophie et Clara, la quarantaine, forment un couple marié depuis plusieurs années, tandis que Julie et Nadia, la trentaine, partagent avec elles une amitié de longue date. Cependant, des secrets bien gardés commencent à percer la surface de leur conversation, teintée d’allusions peu subtiles. Julie lance en riant : « Ce dîner est absolument divin, Clara. Tu sais toujours comment nous satisfaire, n’est-ce pas ? » Un sourire complice échange avec Sophie, qui tente de dissimuler son malaise par un rire forcé. Nadia enchaîne, un brin provocatrice : « Oh, tu l'as dit ! Clara a ce talent... mais Sophie, elle, a une touche vraiment spéciale. Une façon unique de... assaisonner les choses. N'est-ce pas, Sophie ? » Nadia offre un clin d’œil à peine voilé vers Sophie, qui se contente de hocher la tête, son sourire crispé. Sophie, cherchant désespérément à changer de sujet, mentionne alors leur projet de vacances commun. « Vous savez, Clara et moi avons pensé à cette villa à la campagne. Isolée, intime... Juste pour s’évader. » Julie, frôlant l’impertinence, s’exclame : « Oh, l’intimité, c’est important ! N’est-ce pas, Sophie ? Se retrouver... totalement exposées, sans retenue. » Son regard glisse vers Sophie, qui avale difficilement sa gorgée de vin. Clara, jusqu’ici plutôt en retrait et inconsciente des jeux de mots de ses amies, rit doucement. « Vous êtes dans un drôle de mood ce soir, dis donc. » Nadia, poussant le vice un peu plus loin, ajoute : « Clairement, on ne parle pas assez souvent de... comment approfondir nos relations. Sophie a tellement à offrir, une vraie exploratrice. » Son sourire en dit long, tandis que Sophie, visiblement mal à l'aise, lance des regards suppliants en sa direction. Le repas se poursuit, parsemé de rires nerveux et de clins d'œil que Clara semble totalement manquer. Sophie, quant à elle, est partagée entre la culpabilité et l’angoisse que Clara finisse par saisir le sens caché de ces dialogues. C’est alors que Clara, toujours aussi joyeuse et insouciante, propose un brindis. « À nous, à notre amitié indéfectible. Que rien ni personne ne puisse jamais nous séparer. » Les verres s’entrechoquent dans un tintement presque mélancolique, chaque femme plongée dans ses pensées. Les regards échangés entre Julie, Nadia, et Sophie sont lourds de non-dits, tandis que Clara, rayonnante, est loin de se douter des turbulences qui s’agitent sous la surface de cette soirée entre amies. Alors que la soirée s’éteint, les allusions audacieuses de Julie et Nadia résonnent encore, la tension palpable pour toutes, sauf pour Clara, qui, dans son bonheur apparent, ferme la porte derrière ses invitées, ignorant tout du drame silencieux qui se déroule sous son toit."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi une discussion de même nature entre Julie, Nadia, Sophie et Clara mais où Julie et Nadia pompettes à mesure que la soirée avance se montrent plus directes sur le fait que chacune d'elles deux couche avec Sophie, Clara ne sachant pas si c'est vrai (ça l'est) ou si leurs paroles sont à mettre sur le dos de l'alcool, les réactions d'une Sophie en panique n'aidant pas à lever le doute dans le bon sens.

Julie et Nadia, manifestement éméchées, perdent peu à peu la subtilité qui avait précédemment caractérisé leurs propos, tandis que Sophie se retrouve prise au piège de ses propres secrets, oscillant entre la panique et la tentative désespérée de maintenir le semblant d'une façade normale. Clara, elle, navigue entre le scepticisme et l'incrédulité, cherchant à démêler les fils de la vérité dans les paroles alcoolisées de ses amies. « Et alors, Clara, » commence Julie, un sourire malicieux aux lèvres, un verre à la main, « on ne t’a jamais dit combien ta Sophie est... généreuse ? » Sophie, dont le visage est devenu pâle comme un linge, tente maladroitement d'interrompre. « Julie, vraiment, je pense que tu as un peu trop bu, on devrait peut-être... » Mais Nadia enfonce le clou, les inhibitions dissipées par l'alcool. « Oh oui, généreuse et tellement attentionnée ! N’est-ce pas, Sophie ? » Elle pose un regard appuyé sur Sophie, dont le malaise est palpable. Clara, haussant un sourcil, se tourne vers Sophie, dont les tentatives désordonnées de changer de sujet ne sont plus d'aucune utilité. « Vraiment ? Et en quoi exactement Sophie serait-elle... généreuse ? » Julie rit ouvertement, sa voix trahissant son état éméché. « Oh, de toutes les manières que tu puisses imaginer, Clara.

Vous avez trop bu, ce n’est pas... » Mais Clara, son regard oscillant entre l'inquiétude et un début de compréhension, s'interpose d'une voix calme mais ferme. « Attendez, laissez-les parler, Sophie. Je veux entendre ce qu'elles ont à dire. Julie, Nadia, vous êtes en train de dire que... » Julie, se penchant en avant, un sourire imprudent sur ses lèvres, lance alors d'une voix un peu trop forte : « Que nous avons toutes deux partagé des moments spéciaux avec Sophie, oui. » Elle marque une pause dramatique, ignorant ou peut-être savourant l'effet de ses paroles. Nadia, n'ayant plus rien à perdre, ajoute sur le même ton : « Des moments très intimes, si tu vois ce que je veux dire, Clara. Peut-être que Sophie pourrait t'expliquer... » Le silence qui s'ensuit semble étirer le temps, Sophie regarde Clara, son expression un mélange de terreur et de remords. Clara, quant à elle, semble vaciller entre la réalité des mots qu'elle vient d'entendre et l'incrédulité face à l'absurdité de la situation. Son regard se pose sur Sophie, cherchant des réponses dans les yeux de sa compagne. « C'est vrai, Sophie ? Tout cela... » La voix de Clara est douce, presque fragile, l'exact opposé de l'agitation perceptible dans les paroles éméchées de Julie et Nadia. Sophie ouvre la bouche, mais aucun son n'en sort. Les mots lui manquent, l'ampleur de ce qui vient d'être révélé la laissant aussi nue que si tous ses secrets intérieurs avaient été exposés sous les projecteurs. La conversation tourne en rond, les excuses bafouillées de Sophie se heurtant à l'incrédulité de Clara, tandis que les rires étouffés et les commentaires désinvoltes de Julie et Nadia ajoutent une couche supplémentaire de tension à une soirée déjà chargée d'émotion. Finalement, Clara se lève, son mouvement mettant fin à la conversation. « Je pense qu'il est temps pour tout le monde de rentrer chez soi. » Sa voix est calme, mais la détermination qu'elle porte annonce un orage à venir, un orage que la soirée d'ivresse a malencontreusement déclenché."},{"prompt":"Donne-moi la fin de la discussion où Clara, toute honte bu, annonce qu'elle rentre passer la nuit avec une Nadia qui acquiesce avec joie et que Julie est la bienvenue pour se joindre à la fête.

Le regard perçant qu'elle lança autour de la pièce ne laissait place à aucun doute : elle avait pris une décision. « Je pense que ce soir a apporté son lot de révélations », commença-t-elle, sa voix étonnamment ferme malgré le tumulte intérieur qu'elle devait ressentir. « Mais, si des secrets doivent être révélés, alors autant jouer cartes sur table. » Nadia, un peu plus sobre sous l'effet du moment solennel, l'observait attentivement, tandis que Julie, encore sous l'effet de l'ivresse, affichait un sourire énigmatique, ne comprenant pas encore l'entière portée des mots de Clara. « Nadia », Clara se tourna vers elle avec une détermination inattendue, « tu as toujours été une bonne amie... Et ce soir, je te choisis, toi. » Nadia, surprise, sursauta légèrement, son sourire joignant enfin les points dans son esprit encore embrouillé par l'alcool. « Clara... Je suis là. Avec joie. » Clara se tourna ensuite vers Julie, son expression douce mais résolue. « Julie, je t'invite aussi. Ce soir, changeons la dynamique. » Julie, la malice toujours scintillant dans ses yeux, se redressa, l'excitation de l'inattendu pimentant sa voix. « Avec plaisir, Clara. C'est une proposition que je ne saurais refuser. » En face d'elles, Sophie se tenait, figée, la réalisation de la situation lui arrachant un gémissement d'incrédulité. Son monde, jusqu'alors si ordonné malgré ses secrets, semblait s'effondrer autour d'elle, chaque mot de Clara plantant un nouveau clou dans le cercueil de leur relation passée. Sans un autre mot, Clara saisit sa veste, son geste un adieu silencieux à tout ce qui avait été. Nadia et Julie, comprenant l'urgence du moment, se levèrent pour la suivre, leurs mouvements synchronisés marquant le début d'une nouvelle aventure. Sophie, désormais seule dans le silence de la pièce, regardait le dos de celles qui avaient été ses amies, ses amantes, partir sans elle. Le poids de ses décisions et de ses secrets s'alourdissait autour de son cœur, une douleur aiguë lui rappelant ce qu'elle venait de perdre. Mais ce que ni Clara, Nadia, ni Julie ne pouvaient prévoir à ce moment-là, c'était que cette nuit, cette décision impulsivement née d'une soirée trop arrosée et de révélations douloureuses, serait le début de quelque chose de véritablement extraordinaire. Une nuit qui, au lieu de signer la fin, marqua le début de leur trouple, une union passionnée et amoureuse qui allait durer toute la vie. Elles découvriraient ensemble la force d'une relation ouverte et honnête, défiant les conventions et les attentes, pour créer un espace où l'amour, sous toutes ses formes, pouvait non seulement survivre, mais aussi prospérer. Le chemin ne serait pas exempt de défis, car les aspects logistiques et émotionnels d'une telle dynamique demanderaient écoute, communication et ajustements constants. Mais avec chaque obstacle surmonté, leur lien se renforcerait, chaque moment partagé tissant les fils d'une vie commune faite d'amour, de respect et d'une profonde compréhension mutuelle. La nuit s'étendait devant elles, non pas comme une fin, mais comme le commencement lumineux d'un avenir partagé, un horizon plein de promesses et de découvertes. Et tandis que Clara, Nadia et Julie quittaient les lieux ensemble, un sentiment d'excitation mêlé d'anticipation enveloppait leurs cœurs, anticipant les jours, les mois, les années à venir."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Özellikle, Peter Parker'ın içsel mücadeleleri ve kahramanlığın getirdiği sorumluluk temaları üzerinde duruluyor.\\" Key Vocabulary (Anahtar Kelimeler): - büyüleyici: mesmerizing - görsel efektler: visual effects - karakter gelişimi: character development - hayranlar: fans - mest etmek: to mesmerize/to captivate - özellikle: especially - içsel mücadeleler: internal struggles - kahramanlık: heroism - sorumluluk: responsibility - üzerinde durmak: to emphasize As for exporting this vocabulary list as an Excel spreadsheet in an Anki-friendly format, I'm unable to create and export files directly. However, I can guide you on how you might format this yourself. For a basic Anki import, you would structure your spreadsheet with the Turkish words in one column and their English translations in the next column. Here's a quick guide on how you might do it: 1. Open your preferred spreadsheet program (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets). 2. In the first column (A), enter the Turkish vocabulary from the list above. 3. In the adjacent column (B), enter the corresponding English translations. 4. Save the file in a CSV format, typically an option under \\"Save As\\" or \\"Export\\". You can then import this CSV file into Anki by selecting \\"Import File\\" from within the Anki application and following the prompts, ensuring you choose the correct mapping for the front and back of your flashcards. I hope this helps with your learning!

Im Unterschied zur externen Personalbeschaffung, die sich am äußeren Arbeitsmarkt orientiert, geht es bei der internen Personalbeschaffung darum, vakante Stellen mit bereits im Unternehmen vorhandenen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern zu besetzen. Dabei kann zwischen der internen Personalbeschaffung mit oder ohne Personalbewegung unterschieden werden. H2: Welche Arten der internen Personalbeschaffung gibt es? H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung Hier verlassen die Mitarbeiterinnen ihren alten Arbeitsplatz, um im gleichen Unternehmen an einer vollkommen anderen Stelle anzufangen. Methoden für die entsprechende interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung sind: Interne Stellenanzeigen Aushang am schwarzen Brett E-Mail an sämtliche Mitarbeiterinnen Empfehlungen der vorgesetzten Personen, denn diese kennen die Mitarbeiterinnen gut und können ihre entsprechenden Stärken und Schwächen einschätzen Versetzungen Direktansprache Darüber hinaus spielen in diesem Bereich die Laufbahnplanung sowie Mitarbeiterentwicklung eine maßgebliche Rolle. Hierbei geht es darum, bereits frühzeitig innerhalb eines Unternehmens geeignete Mitarbeiterinnen mittels Qualifizierungen durch Weiter- und Fortbildungen, Zusatzausbildungen sowie Coachings für in Zukunft vakante Positionen auszubilden. H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung Die interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung zielt eher darauf ab, einen kurzfristigen Personalbedarf in einzelnen Unternehmensbereichen abzudecken. Das heißt, die Arbeitnehmer*innen behalten grundsätzlich ihre normale Stelle, werden jedoch vorübergehend anders eingesetzt. Methoden dazu sind zum einen die Veränderung der Urlaubsplanung, im Idealfall geschieht das in vorheriger Absprache mit der entsprechenden beschäftigten Person, und zum anderen der vorübergehend verstärkte Einsatz einer Mitarbeiterin oder eines Mitarbeiters. Hier baut die angestellte Person also für eine kurze Zeit Überstunden auf, die sie später wieder abbauen kann. H2: Welche Vorteile und Nachteile hat interne Personalbeschaffung? Dass die interne Personalbeschaffung sowohl mit einigen Vorteilen als auch mit einigen Nachteilen einhergeht, ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Der wohl größte Nachteil an der internen Personalrekrutierung ist, dass nur begrenzte personelle Ressourcen zur Verfügung stehen. Das bedeutet konkret: Ist unter der Belegschaft niemand mit den erforderlichen Qualifikationen oder Fähigkeiten zu finden, lässt sich die Stelle intern nicht besetzen. Bei der externen Rekrutierung ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, andere Kandidaten mit im Zweifel anderen oder besseren Qualifikationen ausfindig zu machen. Externes Recruiting ist jedoch mit dem Schalten von Stellenanzeigen, mit Vorstellungsgesprächen und weiteren zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen verbunden – kurzum: Es kostet Zeit und Geld. Wesentlich wirtschaftlicher erweist sich hierbei die interne Personalbeschaffung. Es ist nicht nötig, zahlreiche Bewerbungsgespräche zu führen, um dann herauszufinden, dass doch nicht der passende Kandidat an Bord ist. Bei der internen Rekrutierung geht das wesentlich schneller und einfacher. Und noch eine Stärke: Die Stammbelegschaft kennt in aller Regel bereits die Ansprechpartner und ist zudem mit der Unternehmenskultur und dem Leitbild der Firma vertraut. Vorteile Nachteile Kostengünstiger Rekrutierungskanal (Time-to-Hire sowie Einarbeitungszeit entfällt) Nur begrenzte Auswahl an passenden Kandidaten verfügbar Stammbelegschaft kennt Firmenstrukturen und Ansprechpartner Weniger Innovationskraft und „frisches“ Know-how Mögliche Aufstiegschancen steigern die Motivation der Mitarbeiter H2: 5 Schritte für eine erfolgreiche Interne Personalbeschaffung Damit die interne Personalbeschaffung das gewünschte Ergebnis bringt (eine offene Stelle wird schnell und kostengünstig mit einem Mitarbeiter besetzt, der das Unternehmen bereits kennt), empfiehlt sich eine Vorgehensweise in fünf Schritten: Schritt eins: Prüfen Sie zunächst, ob es ausreichend Mitarbeiter mit den gesuchten Qualifikationen im Unternehmen gibt, die für die Stelle in Frage kommen könnten. Schritt zwei: Erstellen Sie eine aussagekräftige Stellenausschreibung und kommunizieren Sie diese über die relevanten firmeninternen Kanäle. Schritt drei: Sichten Sie die eingehenden internen Bewerbungen, sprechen Sie mit den jeweiligen Vorgesetzten und klären Sie, ob eventuell fehlende Kompetenzen durch kurzfristige Personalentwicklungs-Maßnahmen aufgebaut werden können. Schritt vier: Prüfen Sie, ob durch den Wechsel des in Frage kommenden Mitarbeiters weiterer Rekrutierungsbedarf entsteht und wie aufwendig diese Stellenbesetzung sein wird. Schritt fünf: Vergessen Sie das Onboarding nicht. Ein Mitarbeiter, der intern seine Stelle wechselt, benötigt zwar keine Einführung in die Unternehmenskultur. Aber auch bei einem internen Wechsel sind Onboarding-Gespräche mit der neuen Führungskraft sehr sinnvoll. H2: Fazit: Interne und externe Rekrutierungskanäle nutzen Wie bereits beschrieben, kann die interne Personalbeschaffung einiges leisten – sie ist kostengünstig und erweist sich auch im Hinblick auf die Motivation der Mitarbeiter als sinnvoll. Dennoch – und das ist das größte Manko – stehen nicht unbegrenzt personelle Ressourcen im eigenen Unternehmen bereit. Es ist also ratsam, auf einen ausgewogenen Mix von externen und internen Rekrutierungsmöglichkeiten zu setzen. Gerade was den Kompetenzgewinn im eigenen Unternehmen angeht, sollten Sie auf fachliche versierte Personen von außen setzen – die das Potenzial haben, frischen Wind ins eigene Unternehmen zu bringen. Wer nur unter seinesgleichen verharrt, könnte schnell betriebsblind werden. Eine Gefahr, die in jedem Fall unterbunden werden muss! ”.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"what does 128k token limit mean in this case?","completion":"The \\"128k token limit\\" typically refers to the maximum amount of tokens (or units of text) that a certain language model or text processing system can handle in a single prompt or input. In the context of AI models like OpenAI's language models (e.g., GPT-3), a token can vary in size—it might represent a word, part of a word (such as a syllable or morpheme), or even punctuation marks and spaces, depending on the tokenization process the model uses. So, when we say there's a \\"128k token limit,\\" it means that the system is capable of processing up to 128,000 tokens in one go. This limit impacts how much text you can generate or analyze in a single interaction with the AI. For tasks requiring the processing of large volumes of text (e.g., analyzing or generating long documents), staying within this limit is crucial to ensure that the model performs optimally. This limit is important for several reasons: - **Performance:** Larger inputs require more computational resources and can lead to slower performance or increased processing times. - **Cost:** For services that charge based on the amount of data processed, staying within token limits can help manage expenses. - **Quality:** Some models may not perform as well with inputs that are too long, as they could \\"forget\\" earlier parts of the text or lose context, affecting the quality of the output. Understanding and managing the token limit is essential for users of AI-based text processing services to ensure they get the desired results efficiently and cost-effectively."},{"prompt":"i like so many girls and they like me back. it stresses me out not being able to take a decision. on top of that, i struggle taking the first step.","completion":"Feeling liked and being interested in multiple people can indeed be overwhelming, especially when you're uncertain about taking the first step or making a decision. It's important to navigate these feelings with care and consider what you genuinely want out of these potential relationships. Here are a few suggestions on how to approach this situation: # Reflect on Your Feelings - **Understand Your Feelings:** Try to understand why you like these individuals and what you like about them. Are your feelings deep and personal, or are they more about surface-level attraction? - **Prioritize:** Consider what qualities are most important to you in a relationship. This can help you prioritize whom you might want to pursue a deeper connection with. # Communication is Key - **Be Honest:** It's important to be honest with yourself and the people involved. Leading someone on or being unclear about your intentions can hurt others and complicate situations further. - **Open Conversations:** When appropriate, having open and honest conversations about your feelings can be beneficial. This doesn't mean declaring undying love; rather, it's about expressing interest in getting to know them better. # Taking the First Step - **Start Small:** The first step doesn't have to be a grand gesture. It could be something as simple as asking someone out for coffee or to a casual event. This can help ease the pressure you feel. - **Rejection is Part of Life:** Fear of rejection is common, but it's important to remember that rejection is a natural part of life. It's better to have tried and known than to live with 'what if.' # Manage Stress and Decision-Making - **Take Your Time:** Don't rush your decision. It's okay to take your time to understand your feelings and what you truly want. - **Seek Support:** Talking to friends, family, or a therapist can provide you with different perspectives and help you navigate your feelings. # Self-Reflection and Growth - **Understand Your Motivations:** Sometimes, the attention from multiple interests can be flattering and boost one's ego. Reflect on whether the stress is coming from not wanting to hurt others, fear of making the wrong choice, or perhaps the excitement of new relationships. - **Personal Growth:** Use this experience as an opportunity for personal growth. Understanding what you want out of a relationship and how to manage complex feelings are valuable life skills. It’s essential to treat everyone involved with respect and kindness, including yourself. Managing romantic feelings and attractions can be confusing, but it's also a part of learning and growing in your emotional and relational intelligence."},{"prompt":"i always take my time. i'd rather say i take too much of it. that's why they lose interest or make an approach harder as time passes by.","completion":"Taking a lot of time to make decisions, especially in the realm of romantic relationships, can indeed lead to challenges like potential partners losing interest or the initial momentum fading, making engagements feel more daunting. This tendency could be rooted in fear of making the wrong choice, concerns about the future, or perhaps an underlying anxiety about initiating deeper connections. Whatever the cause, it's important to address this pattern so you can form meaningful relationships without undue stress. Here are some strategies that might help: # Recognize the Value of Action - **Mindful Decision-Making:** While it's good to be thoughtful, excessively delaying decisions can lead to missed opportunities. Try to find a balance between careful consideration and actionable decision-making. - **Opportunity Cost:** Understand that \\"taking too much time\\" has its costs, including potentially missing out on relationships that could be enriching. Awareness of what you might be losing can sometimes help spur action. # Overcoming Analysis Paralysis - **Set Deadlines:** Giving yourself a clear deadline to make a decision (e.g., asking someone out) can move you from a state of indecision to action. The deadline should be reasonable but firm enough to push you out of your comfort zone. - **Simplify Your Choices:** When facing multiple options, try to narrow them down to the top two or three based on the qualities that matter most to you. This can make the decision feel less overwhelming. # Fear of Rejection or Failure - **Reframe Rejection:** Start to view rejection not as a failure but as a step towards finding the right match. Every rejection is a learning opportunity and brings you closer to the right person. - **Practice Vulnerability:** Taking small steps in sharing your feelings or showing interest can make such actions feel more manageable. This gradual approach can build your confidence in taking bigger steps. # Improving Self-Communication - **Understand Your Needs:** Spend some time reflecting on what you're truly looking for in a relationship. Are you ready for a commitment, or are you more interested in casual dating? Clarity can guide your actions. - **Listen to Your Emotions:** Sometimes, hesitation is rooted in deeper emotions or past experiences. Acknowledge these feelings and consider discussing them with a trusted friend or a therapist for insights and resolution. # Take Action - **Initiate Small, Meaningful Actions:** Small gestures or invitations can be less daunting and help keep the interest alive between you and potential partners. It can be as simple as maintaining regular communication or suggesting a casual meet-up. - **Feedback Loop:** After taking an action, reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and how it made you feel. This self-feedback loop can be instrumental in guiding your future actions and decisions. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach to relationships, and everyone moves at their own pace. However, if your cautious nature is holding you back from forming meaningful connections, experimenting with these strategies could help you find more balance in your decision-making process."},{"prompt":"explain fast inverse square root algorithm, as implemented in quake","completion":"The fast inverse square root algorithm is a famous piece of code that was used in the game Quake, developed by id Software, to efficiently compute the inverse square root of a floating-point number, (1/sqrt{x}).

Одним из первых авиаперевозчиков стало государственное предприятие \\"Kyrgyz Avia\\", основанное в 1946 году. В дальнейшем оно было реорганизовано в Национальный авиационный оператор \\"Kyrgyzstan Air Lines\\". В 1992 году была создана национальная авиакомпания \\"Kyrgyzstan Airlines\\", которая стала основным оператором воздушных перевозок в стране. Однако, с началом независимости Кыргызстана и развитием рыночных отношений, в сфере воздушного транспорта появились новые частные авиакомпании, такие как \\"Air Manas\\", \\"Tez Jet\\", \\"Avia Traffic Company\\" и др., которые также стали активно развиваться и конкурировать на внутреннем и международном рынке. С 2000-х годов начался активный процесс модернизации и развития инфраструктуры аэропортов Кыргызстана, в частности аэропорта Манас, который стал основным международным узлом в регионе. Важным событием в истории кыргызской авиации было открытие нового аэропорта \\"Чалдронг\\" в столице Бишкеке в 2014 году, который способствовал увеличению пассажиропотока и улучшению качества обслуживания. Сегодня воздушный транспорт продолжает играть важную роль в экономическом развитии Кыргызстана, обеспечивая связь страны с международными рынками, удобство и скорость перемещения для граждан и туристов.

Please provide details for forms component in which i need details as Description","completion":"# Forms Component Description: Forms are crucial components on websites and applications, allowing users to input data, make choices, and interact with various functionalities. From registration pages to search fields, forms facilitate a critical part of user interaction online. For content authors, creating forms that are both effective and accessible is essential to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can use them without barriers. A truly accessible form is one that accommodates users with a range of disabilities, including visual, cognitive, motor, and hearing impairments. This involves thoughtful design and implementation, from the structure and layout to the labeling and validation messages. Accessibility in forms ensures compliance with global standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and enhances the overall user experience, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction. Key components of an accessible form include clear and descriptive labels, logical tab orders, meaningful error messages, and compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers. Properly implemented, these elements allow users to navigate, understand, and interact with forms regardless of how they access the web. In designing accessible forms, content authors should focus on: - **Labeling:** Each form control (text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) must have a clear and descriptive label that is programmatically associated with the control. This helps users understand what information is required and how it should be formatted. - **Instructions:** Providing simple and clear instructions for form completion can assist users in understanding how to fill out the form correctly, reducing errors and frustration. - **Error Identification and Description:** Forms should include mechanisms to identify errors clearly and provide suggestions for correction. These messages should be meaningful and positioned in a way that they are easily associated with the respective form control. - **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensuring that forms can be navigated using a keyboard alone is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. This includes logical tab sequences and keyboard shortcuts where applicable. - **Feedback:** Providing immediate and clear feedback, such as indicating required fields or the success of form submission, supports a smooth user experience. - **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Ensure that forms work well with screen readers and other assistive technologies by using proper HTML5 and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, properties, and states. # Conclusion For content authors, understanding and implementing these accessibility principles in form design not only meets legal compliance but significantly improves the overall user experience for everyone. By prioritizing accessibility, authors contribute to creating a more inclusive and equitable digital environment."},{"prompt":"what is Sensory Characteristics","completion":"Sensory characteristics refer to attributes that can be perceived through the senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. In the context of web accessibility and the design of digital content and interfaces, the term often pertains to how information is presented and how it relies on sensory characteristics for its comprehension. According to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), relying solely on sensory characteristics like shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound to convey information can lead to accessibility barriers. This issue arises because such an approach does not accommodate all users, especially those with disabilities that affect sensory perception. For instance, instructions that tell users to \\"click on the green button\\" to continue assume that all users can perceive the color green, which is not the case for individuals with color vision deficiencies. To ensure information is accessible to everyone, including those who use assistive technologies, it's crucial to provide information that does not rely exclusively on sensory characteristics. WCAG guideline 1.3.3 (Sensory Characteristics) specifies that instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. # Best Practices for Addressing Sensory Characteristics in Web Accessibility: - **Use Text Labels:** Supplement visual cues with text labels. Rather than solely instructing to \\"click the large button,\\" specify the action or name of the button, e.g., \\"click the 'Submit' button.\\" - **Include Additional Descriptors:** When referencing elements, provide additional descriptors that do not rely on sensory characteristics alone. For example, \\"the link to contact us, located at the top right of the page, under the search bar,\\" offers a location descriptor that doesn't solely depend on visual cues. - **Provide Text Alternatives:** For information conveyed through images, videos, or sounds, provide text alternatives. Alt texts for images, transcripts for audio content, and captions for videos are essential. - **Use Clear Instructions:** Avoid instructions based solely on sound or visual characteristics. Ensure that any instructions can be understood regardless of the sensory modality used by your audience. For example, instead of saying, \\"follow the sound to find your way,” adding a tactile or verbal navigation system could be beneficial. - **Focus on Logical Structure:** Structured headings, lists, and consistent, logical layouts help users who depend on assistive technologies to understand and navigate the content with ease. By addressing sensory characteristics appropriately, content creators and designers can create more accessible digital environments that cater to a broader audience, including those with disabilities that affect how they perceive content through their senses."},{"prompt":"Please provide description of Page/Browser, i need to add in the content author handbook, ple","completion":"# Page/Browser Description The \\"Page/Browser\\" component refers to the broader environment in which web content is accessed and interacted with by users. This encompasses the full page that a user interacts with within a web browser, along with the browser's functionalities that support or enhance user interaction with the content. Understanding how content behaves across different pages and browsers is crucial for ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience. For content authors, designing and developing with the page and browser context in mind involves several key considerations. These include responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and the integration of navigation aids. It’s also about ensuring that content is accessible in various settings and devices, from desktop computers with large screens to mobile devices with touch interfaces. Moreover, the interaction of web content with browser-native features, like form autofill and accessibility tools, should be facilitated and not hindered. Authors must recognize the importance of semantic HTML to ensure that assistive technologies can accurately interpret and interact with web content. Key Considerations for Content Authors: - **Responsiveness:** Ensure that your web content is flexible and accessible across a range of devices with different screen sizes and orientations. Use responsive design techniques so that content layout adjusts smoothly to the viewing environment. - **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test your content across different web browsers and versions to guarantee that it remains functional and consistent. This helps identify and rectify browser-specific issues, ensuring a uniform experience for all users. - **Navigation Aids:** Implementing clear and consistent navigation aids, such as skip links, breadcrumbs, and a logical tab order, enhances accessibility and user experience. These aids are particularly vital for users with mobility impairments or those who rely on keyboard navigation. - **Semantic Markup:** Use HTML elements according to their intended purpose. Semantic markup not only aids in SEO but also ensures that assistive technologies can present content accurately to users with disabilities. - **Browser Tools Integration:** Facilitate the use of browser tools and features, such as zoom functions, text resizing, and voice commands. Ensure that these tools work seamlessly with your content, enhancing accessibility. - **Accessibility Features:** Leverage the accessibility features provided by browsers, such as high contrast modes and built-in screen readers. Ensure your content is compatible with these features to accommodate users with visual impairments. # Conclusion The Page/Browser component plays a pivotal role in ensuring an accessible and positive user experience. By understanding and implementing best practices around responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and accessible design, content authors can create web content that is both inclusive and engaging. Focusing on these areas ensures that all users, regardless of their device, browser choice, or accessibility needs, can access and benefit from web content effectively."},{"prompt":"Please provide description of Language and language of parts, i need to add in the content author handbook,","completion":"# Language and Language of Parts Description: The \\"Language and Language of Parts\\" guideline is an essential aspect of web content accessibility, focusing on correctly specifying the primary language of a webpage as well as the language of any parts of the page that are in a different language. This practice is crucial for creating content that is accessible to a global audience, including those who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers to access web content. Properly marked-up language ensures that these technologies can accurately interpret and pronounce content in the intended language. Importance for Content Authors: For content authors, adhering to this guideline not only enhances the user experience for non-native speakers and users with disabilities but also contributes to better SEO, as it helps search engines understand the content more accurately. It involves specifying the primary language of a document using the \`lang\` attribute in the HTML \`<html>\` tag, and indicating changes in language within the content using the same attribute on elements enclosing text in the different language. Key Considerations for Content Authors: - **Specifying the Primary Language:** Ensure that the primary language of the web page is clearly indicated using the \`lang\` attribute in the opening \`<html>\` tag (e.g., \`<html lang=\\"en\\">\`). This allows user agents and assistive technologies to process the page content in the correct language. - **Identifying Changes in Language:** When the content includes phrases, sentences, or blocks of text in a language different from the primary language of the page, use the \`lang\` attribute on the enclosing element to specify the correct language (e.g., \`<p lang=\\"fr\\">Bonjour</p>\`). This ensures that screen readers and other assistive technologies can switch language profiles to pronounce the text accurately. - **Avoiding Language Confusion:** By accurately marking the language of content, authors help prevent confusion for screen reader users and non-native speakers, ensuring that content is as clear and understandable as possible. - **Supporting a Global Audience:** Identifying the primary language and changes in language supports globalization by making content accessible and inclusive to a wide audience, regardless of their native language or geographical location. - **Compliance with International Standards:** Following the \\"Language and Language of Parts\\" guideline is part of adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which is a set of internationally recognized criteria for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. # Conclusion Properly specifying the language of web content and any of its parts in a different language is a fundamental step in creating accessible, user-friendly web experiences. Content authors play a crucial role in implementing this practice, which not only aids users who depend on assistive technologies but also supports linguistic diversity and comprehension for all users. By paying close attention to the language properties of web content, authors can significantly contribute to the accessibility and inclusiveness of the digital world."},{"prompt":"What is multimedia , Pre-recorded Audio only Content, Pre-recorded Video only Content, Pre-recorded Audio and Video Content, Live Multimedia in terms of content author. I need only definitions for all","completion":"# Multimedia Definitions for Content Authors: **Multimedia:** Multimedia refers to content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video, and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with traditional media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. For content authors, multimedia presents a dynamic method to engage users by appealing to multiple senses, often leading to a more effective and immersive communication experience. **Pre-recorded Audio Only Content:** This type of content consists of sound recordings that are available for users to play back at their convenience. Pre-recorded audio only content does not include visual components and is typically used for podcasts, music, informational recordings, or narrated content. The key characteristic is that the audio is created, edited, and finalized before it is published and made available to listeners. **Pre-recorded Video Only Content:** Pre-recorded video only content refers to visual recordings without an accompanying audio track. This type of content relies on visual elements such as motion, changes in scenery, text overlays, and visual effects to convey information or tell a story. It is particularly useful for audiences in sound-sensitive environments or where the visual narrative is sufficient to convey the message, such as silent animations or instructional sign language videos. **Pre-recorded Audio and Video Content:** This category combines both sound and visual elements that have been recorded and edited prior to being made available. Pre-recorded audio and video content is used widely across digital platforms for entertainment, education, marketing, and information dissemination. The synchronized combination of audio and visual elements enables content authors to provide a rich, immersive user experience. **Live Multimedia:** Live multimedia refers to content that is broadcast or shared in real-time with an audience. It includes live audio streams, live video broadcasts, or a combination of both, along with interactive elements that may allow for audience participation. Webinars, live-streamed events, and real-time video chats are examples of live multimedia. This type of content allows content authors to engage directly with an audience, providing immediate interaction and feedback."},{"prompt":"i need examples for Pre-recorded Audio only Content","completion":"Pre-recorded audio-only content encompasses a wide variety of formats that deliver auditory information or entertainment without accompanying visual elements.

Im Unterschied zur externen Personalbeschaffung, die sich am äußeren Arbeitsmarkt orientiert, geht es bei der internen Personalbeschaffung darum, vakante Stellen mit bereits im Unternehmen vorhandenen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern zu besetzen. Dabei kann zwischen der internen Personalbeschaffung mit oder ohne Personalbewegung unterschieden werden. H2: Welche Arten der internen Personalbeschaffung gibt es? H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung Hier verlassen die Mitarbeiterinnen ihren alten Arbeitsplatz, um im gleichen Unternehmen an einer vollkommen anderen Stelle anzufangen. Methoden für die entsprechende interne Personalbeschaffung mit Personalbewegung sind: Interne Stellenanzeigen Aushang am schwarzen Brett E-Mail an sämtliche Mitarbeiterinnen Empfehlungen der vorgesetzten Personen, denn diese kennen die Mitarbeiterinnen gut und können ihre entsprechenden Stärken und Schwächen einschätzen Versetzungen Direktansprache Darüber hinaus spielen in diesem Bereich die Laufbahnplanung sowie Mitarbeiterentwicklung eine maßgebliche Rolle. Hierbei geht es darum, bereits frühzeitig innerhalb eines Unternehmens geeignete Mitarbeiterinnen mittels Qualifizierungen durch Weiter- und Fortbildungen, Zusatzausbildungen sowie Coachings für in Zukunft vakante Positionen auszubilden. H3: Interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung Die interne Personalbeschaffung ohne Personalbewegung zielt eher darauf ab, einen kurzfristigen Personalbedarf in einzelnen Unternehmensbereichen abzudecken. Das heißt, die Arbeitnehmer*innen behalten grundsätzlich ihre normale Stelle, werden jedoch vorübergehend anders eingesetzt. Methoden dazu sind zum einen die Veränderung der Urlaubsplanung, im Idealfall geschieht das in vorheriger Absprache mit der entsprechenden beschäftigten Person, und zum anderen der vorübergehend verstärkte Einsatz einer Mitarbeiterin oder eines Mitarbeiters. Hier baut die angestellte Person also für eine kurze Zeit Überstunden auf, die sie später wieder abbauen kann. H2: Welche Vorteile und Nachteile hat interne Personalbeschaffung? Dass die interne Personalbeschaffung sowohl mit einigen Vorteilen als auch mit einigen Nachteilen einhergeht, ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Der wohl größte Nachteil an der internen Personalrekrutierung ist, dass nur begrenzte personelle Ressourcen zur Verfügung stehen. Das bedeutet konkret: Ist unter der Belegschaft niemand mit den erforderlichen Qualifikationen oder Fähigkeiten zu finden, lässt sich die Stelle intern nicht besetzen. Bei der externen Rekrutierung ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch, andere Kandidaten mit im Zweifel anderen oder besseren Qualifikationen ausfindig zu machen. Externes Recruiting ist jedoch mit dem Schalten von Stellenanzeigen, mit Vorstellungsgesprächen und weiteren zeitlichen und finanziellen Ressourcen verbunden – kurzum: Es kostet Zeit und Geld. Wesentlich wirtschaftlicher erweist sich hierbei die interne Personalbeschaffung. Es ist nicht nötig, zahlreiche Bewerbungsgespräche zu führen, um dann herauszufinden, dass doch nicht der passende Kandidat an Bord ist. Bei der internen Rekrutierung geht das wesentlich schneller und einfacher. Und noch eine Stärke: Die Stammbelegschaft kennt in aller Regel bereits die Ansprechpartner und ist zudem mit der Unternehmenskultur und dem Leitbild der Firma vertraut. Vorteile Nachteile Kostengünstiger Rekrutierungskanal (Time-to-Hire sowie Einarbeitungszeit entfällt) Nur begrenzte Auswahl an passenden Kandidaten verfügbar Stammbelegschaft kennt Firmenstrukturen und Ansprechpartner Weniger Innovationskraft und „frisches“ Know-how Mögliche Aufstiegschancen steigern die Motivation der Mitarbeiter H2: 5 Schritte für eine erfolgreiche Interne Personalbeschaffung Damit die interne Personalbeschaffung das gewünschte Ergebnis bringt (eine offene Stelle wird schnell und kostengünstig mit einem Mitarbeiter besetzt, der das Unternehmen bereits kennt), empfiehlt sich eine Vorgehensweise in fünf Schritten: Schritt eins: Prüfen Sie zunächst, ob es ausreichend Mitarbeiter mit den gesuchten Qualifikationen im Unternehmen gibt, die für die Stelle in Frage kommen könnten. Schritt zwei: Erstellen Sie eine aussagekräftige Stellenausschreibung und kommunizieren Sie diese über die relevanten firmeninternen Kanäle. Schritt drei: Sichten Sie die eingehenden internen Bewerbungen, sprechen Sie mit den jeweiligen Vorgesetzten und klären Sie, ob eventuell fehlende Kompetenzen durch kurzfristige Personalentwicklungs-Maßnahmen aufgebaut werden können. Schritt vier: Prüfen Sie, ob durch den Wechsel des in Frage kommenden Mitarbeiters weiterer Rekrutierungsbedarf entsteht und wie aufwendig diese Stellenbesetzung sein wird. Schritt fünf: Vergessen Sie das Onboarding nicht. Ein Mitarbeiter, der intern seine Stelle wechselt, benötigt zwar keine Einführung in die Unternehmenskultur. Aber auch bei einem internen Wechsel sind Onboarding-Gespräche mit der neuen Führungskraft sehr sinnvoll. H2: Fazit: Interne und externe Rekrutierungskanäle nutzen Wie bereits beschrieben, kann die interne Personalbeschaffung einiges leisten – sie ist kostengünstig und erweist sich auch im Hinblick auf die Motivation der Mitarbeiter als sinnvoll. Dennoch – und das ist das größte Manko – stehen nicht unbegrenzt personelle Ressourcen im eigenen Unternehmen bereit. Es ist also ratsam, auf einen ausgewogenen Mix von externen und internen Rekrutierungsmöglichkeiten zu setzen. Gerade was den Kompetenzgewinn im eigenen Unternehmen angeht, sollten Sie auf fachliche versierte Personen von außen setzen – die das Potenzial haben, frischen Wind ins eigene Unternehmen zu bringen. Wer nur unter seinesgleichen verharrt, könnte schnell betriebsblind werden. Eine Gefahr, die in jedem Fall unterbunden werden muss! ”.

In Deutschland werden weder die normative Geltung des Rechtsstaates noch seine reale Existenz, also dessen Prinzipientreue in der praktischen Politik bestritten; noch wird bezweifelt, daß er sich unterdessen auf die neuen Aufgaben eingerichtet hat, zum Beispiel gegenüber dem Widerspruch zwischen freier politischer Artikulation subjektiver Bedürfnisse und den Erfordernissen einer der Öffentlichkeit entzogenen Produktionsplanung, zwischen Autonomiebestrebungen und industrieller Disziplin usw. Vielmehr spricht man von einer Krise, die von außen den Rechtsstaat bedroht, von einem Angriff durch Gruppen und Kräfte, die außerhalb der Verfassung stehen: Terrorismus, Umsturzpläne, Subversion, aber auch industrieller Dissens, alternative Bewegungen, fundamentale Opposition. In Italien scheint der Notausgang aus der Krise eher in der Wiederherstellung eines „gesunden” und garantierenden Staatsgefüges zu liegen, in der Erneuerung einer politischen Form, die von paradoxen Zuständen erschüttert ist und in die traditionelle Gestalt zurückgeführt werden soll. Folglich sucht man in Deutschland die Krise durch Identifikation und Bekämpfung des Elements zu meistern, das in der Sprache eines Carl Schmitt als innerstaatlicher Feind definiert wird. Keine Eingriffe in die Institutionen also, sondern die Auffindung eines korrekten Wegs, den inneren Feind auszuschalten, ohne legale Strukturen zu durchbrechen, ohne die Verfassungsform zu verletzen - ein Weg, der auch der Gefahr entgeht, „das Spiel des Feindes zu spielen”.4 Derart behauptet der Staat sich als „Rechtsstaat”. Der „Rechtsstaat\\" Wir kommen an einen Punkt, der für das Verständnis des Problems recht wichtig ist: der Staat gerät in die Krise, wenn seine Befehlsgewalt den inneren Feind nicht erfaßt, den ich oben als fundamentale Opposition bezeichnet habe - die Opposition, die nicht nur Regierungsmehrheiten oder die nationale Einheit negiert, sondern in die Tiefe geht und die ökonomisch-sozialen Strukturen sowie konsequenterweise auch deren politische Vermittlung trifft. Nicht ohne Grund weitete sich die Praxis der Berufsverbote immer mehr aus und galt am Ende - entlang der eigenen, gegen jede Art von Dissens gerichteten Logik - zuweilen auch harmlosen linken Sozialdemokraten. Sicher scheint eine solche Methode auf den ersten Blick der deutschen oder auch der mitteleuropäischen Tradition zu entsprechen, sich an der abstrakten Identifizierung von Recht, Gesetz und Gerechtigkeit zu orientieren. Ihre Wurzeln reichen weit hinab in die Vergangenheit, zu den alten vorindustriellen Allianzen von Thron und Altar, die sich später schmerzlos in den „preußischen Weg zum Kapitalismus” einfügten - in einem Land, wo Kants mahnende Frage, „ob das, was Rechtens ist, auch recht sei” (Metaphysik der Sitten), ungehört blieb. Auch die Weimarer Republik stellte sich ohne Unterbrechung der Kontinuität in die Tradition des „Ordnung muß sein” (der deutschen Version des fiat justitia, pereat mundus). Sie wurde in den Anfängen der ersten deutschen Republik durch die problematische Gestalt des sozialdemokratischen Ministers Noske repräsentiert, in gewisser Hinsicht Retter der Verfassung gegen den Aufstand des Spartakusbundes und - wenn auch nicht direkt - mitverantwortlich für den Mord an Rosa Luxemburg und Karl Liebknecht. („Einer von uns”, soll Noske gesagt haben, „muß der Bluthund sein”). Selbst der Nazismus brach bei der „Machtergreifung” formal nicht mit der Linie institutionell geregelter Herrschaft. Um Mißverständnisse zu vermeiden und die Bedeutung des 30. Januar nicht zu verharmlosen: zweifellos brach der Nazismus gleich nach der Regierungsübernahme mit dem Garantieelement der Weimarer Verfassung und ließ das Machtelement des Staats nackt hervortreten, nahm also eine gewalttätig-willkürliche Qualität an und schob normative Regelungen herkömmlicher Art beiseite. Dies im Gegensatz zum italienischen Faschismus, der bis Mitte der 30er Jahre die Linie strikter bürgerlich-kapitalistischer Funktionalität einhielt. (Regimegegner wurden bekanntlich weitgehend durch Gerichtsverhandlungen und gesetzlich gedeckte Maßnahmen ausgeschaltet, nicht durch Nacht und Nebel-Aktionen). Andererseits ist es nichts weniger als zufällig, daß der Nazismus nach dem traditionellen Denkmuster auf der „Legalität” seiner Machtergreifung bestand (die sogenannte legale Revolution). Hitler hätte ohne weiteres Mussolini nachahmen und die Drohung wiederholen können, die „sorda aula” des Reichstags in ein Lager für seine SA zu verwandeln. Aber er unterließ dies und war im Anfang zynisch um die Spielregeln und um den Respekt gegenüber der bestehenden Ordnung besorgt. So verneigte er sich erstens vor Hindenburg und ersuchte dann den Reichstag parlamentarisch korrekt um die Erteilung der Vollmacht. In paradoxer Weise hielt er sich also an die Weimarer Verfassung. Es scheint mir jedoch angebracht zu präzisieren, worin dieser Rechtsstaat sozusagen deutschen Typus eigentlich besteht; umso mehr, als er immer häufiger als Lösungsmodell für institutionelle Krisen, als Vorbild für die staatliche Bewältigung wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Schwierigkeiten angesehen wird. Diese Präzisierung gilt in erster Linie für die wissenschaftliche Diskussion um den Garantiestaat. Es könnte deutlich werden, daß ihr ganzer, auf die gesicherte Verteidigung der subjektiven Rechte gerichteter Ansatz sehr bald mit einer ganz anders gearteten Wirklichkeit aneinandergerät. Das Wesen, oder konkreter: die Funktion des gepriesenen Systems entzaubert sich. Sie findet sich in dem Auftrag, die Bürgerrechte nicht zu garantieren, sondern sie einzugrenzen. Der Staat umschreibt sie und engt somit Inhalt und Reichweite ihrer Realisierbarkeit ein. Mit seinen Gesetzen „bestimmt er sie näher”. Auch in diesem Fall gilt Spinozas Satz: omnis determinatio est negatio, die Negation des zwangsfreien Gebrauchs der Freiheit, kurz gesagt, die Negation der Autonomie. Damit wir uns recht verstehen: es geht hier weder um einen abstrakten Zustand noch um einen idealen Sachverhalt, sondern um konkrete Erfordernisse im Reproduktionsprozeß unserer Gesellschaft. Ich meine etwa die freie Ausübung des Streikrechtes, die Handlungsautonomie von Abhängigen, aus der konstituierten Ordnung, aber auch aus den Ritualisierungen der Konflikte auszuscheren, insofern Rituale und Ordnung selbst sich als unfähig erweisen, Forderungen nach Emanzipation und -warum nicht - nach dem Brechtschen Wohlstand angemessen zu befriedigen. Wenn es zur Aufgabe des Verfassungsstaates gehört, die Fre eit zu garantieren, und er sich zu diesem Behufe als Rechtsstaat definiert, so meint er gleichzeitig auch seine Funktion, den sozialen Räumen durch Gesetze und Institutionen wieder die Autonomie zu nehmen; er meint seine Befugnis, jeden Dissens auszugrenzen. Seine Berechtigung dazu holt er sich aus einem unterstellten, generellen Konsens sowie aus einer unbestimmten, vagen Zustimmung der Bevölkerung zu seiner durchgängigen Regelungskompetenz. In diesem Zusammenhang gewinnt ein in Deutschland geltendes, informelles Gebot eine spezifische Eigenbedeutung, die aber ohne weiteres für die Vorschläge der italienischen Modernisierer gelten kann: „Es darf keine rechtsfreie Sphäre geben” - was soviel heißt wie: alle gesellschaftliche Autonomie ist verboten. (Zur Ergänzung: Diese Aussage aus dem Jahre 1982 fand 10 Jahre später eine Bestätigung. „Autonome Zonen dürfen nicht geduldet werden”. So der gelehrte Kollege Thomas Würtenberger, Beständigkeit im Wandel. Unser Rechtsstaat und der Zeitgeist, in: Politische Studien, Sonderheft 5/1993, S. 16). Alles wird der juristischen Disziplinierung unterworfen, sei es erzwungen, sei es freiwillig. Es geht aber keineswegs um bloße teutonische Absonderlichkeit, die der italienischen Gesellschaft, ihren Traditionen und Tendenzen fern läge. Ein solcher Ausspruch fügt sich problemlos sowohl in die, in Italien noch breiter angelegte, Ausweitung der juristisch geregelten Materie, wie auch in die Totalisierung des Legalitätsprinzips (womit man wieder bei Luhmann wäre, der neugekürten Autorität auf dem rechten Flügel der italischen Linken).”翻译为中文","completion":"对我来说，在意大利关于这场危机的讨论和德国的讨论之间进行区分似乎极为有用。在德国，法治的规范有效性，其实际存在即其在实际政治中的原则忠诚性不受质疑；也不质疑它是否已经适应了新的任务，例如面对自由政治表达个人需求与公众无从知晓的生产计划之间的矛盾、自治愿望与工业纪律等之间的矛盾。相反，人们谈论的是一场从外部威胁法治的危机，由站在宪法之外的集团和力量发起的攻击：恐怖主义、颠覆计划、颠覆活动，但也包括工业异议、替代运动、根本性反对。在意大利，危机的出路似乎更多地在于恢复一个“健康”且有保障的国家结构，在于政治形态的更新，这种政治形态被悖论状态所动摇，应该回归到传统形态。因此，在德国，人们通过识别和打击被卡尔·施密特用语言定义为国内敌人的元素来应对危机。因此不干预机构，而是寻找一条正确的道路，消除内部敌人，不破坏合法结构，不违反宪法形式 - 这样一条道路，也避免了“玩弄敌人的游戏”的危险。这样，国家就声明自己为“法治国家”。 “法治国家” 我们来到了一个对理解问题非常重要的点：当国家的命令权未能涵盖我之前称为根本性反对的内部敌人时，国家就会陷入危机 - 这种反对不仅否定政府多数或国家统一，而且深入地打击经济社会结构以及其政治媒介。毫不奇怪，职业禁止的做法越来越广泛，最终因其自身对任何形式异议的逻辑而有时也适用于无害的左翼社会民主党人。 这种方法乍看之下似乎符合德国甚至中欧传统，该传统以对法律、法规和正义的抽象认同为导向。其根源深远，可追溯至早期前工业时期的王权和祭坛之间的联盟，后来无痛地融入了“普鲁士通往资本主义之路” - 在这个国家，康德警告性的问题，“是否合法的东西也是对的”（《道德形而上学》）未曾受到关注。 魏玛共和国也没有中断地将自己置于“必须有秩序”（德国版本的fiat justitia, pereat mundus）的传统之中。它在第一次德国共和国初期通过社会民主党部长诺斯克的复杂形象得以体现，某种意义上他是对抗斯巴达克联盟起义并间接参与罗莎·卢森堡和卡尔·李卜克内西谋杀的宪法的救星。（“我们中必须有一个人成为血犬”，诺斯克据说如是说）。甚至纳粹主义在“夺权”时也没有从形式上与制度化统治的路线断绝。为避免误读和轻视1月30日的意义：毫无疑问，纳粹主义在接管政府后立即打破了魏玛宪法的保障元素，并裸露出国家的权力元素，采取了暴力专断的品质，推开了常规的规範安排。与此相反，意大利法西斯主义直到30年代中期都保持了严格的资产阶级资本主义功能性。（如众所周知，反政府者主要通过法庭审判和法律支持的措施被排除，而不是通过秘密行动）。另一方面，毫不奇怪的是，纳粹主义坚持其“夺权”的“合法性”（所谓的合法革命）。希特勒本可以轻易地模仿墨索里尼，重复威胁将国会大厦变成他的盖世太保的营地。但他没有这样做，最初他对规则和对现有秩序的尊重持嘲讽态度。因此，他首先向兴登堡鞠躬尊敬，然后以议会正确的方式请求授予他权力。以一种悖论的方式，他因此遵循了魏玛宪法。 然而，我认为有必要精确说明这种所谓的德国类型的法治国家实际上是什么；更是因为它越来越多地被视为解决机构危机的模型，作为处理经济和社会困难的国家范例。这种精确主要针对围绕保障国家的学术讨论。可能会明显地看到，她们全部针对确保主观权利的防御的方法很快就会与一种完全不同的现实发生冲突。这套赞美的系统的本质，或更具体地说：其功能的消解。它发现自己的任务是不去保障公民权利，而是限制它们。国家界定它们，并因此限制了它们实现的内容和范围。国家通过其法律“具体规定它们”。在这种情况下，斯宾诺莎的命题成立：omnis determinatio est negatio，即自由使用自由的非强制性否定，简单来说，就是自治的否定。 请让我们清楚一点：这里的讨论既不关乎一个抽象的状态，也不关乎一个理想的状况，而是关乎我们社会再生产过程中的具体要求。我指的是，例如，罢工权的自由行使，从构建的秩序中脱离，甚至从冲突的仪式化中脱离的从属者的行动自主权，因为仪式和秩序本身被证明无法充分满足解放需求，以及为什么不 - 按照布莱希特的幸福。 如果宪法国家的任务是保证自由，并且它为此自定义为法治国家，那么它同时也意味着它通过法律和机构剥夺社会空间的自主权的功能；它意味着它有权排除任何异议。它从假设的、普遍的共识以及人们对其全面规定能力的模糊、不确定的同意中获取其合法性。在这个背景下，一个在德国有效的非正式规则获得了特定的意义，但这在意大利现代化者的提案中也很容易适用：“不得有无权之地” - 这意味着所有社会自主都是禁止的。（补充说明：这句话来自1982年，10年后得到了确认。“不得容忍自主区域”。因此学术界的同行托马斯·维尔滕贝格尔，《变革中的稳定性。我们的法治国家与时代精神》，政治研究，特刊5/1993，第16页）。一切都被纳入法律管辖之下，无论是被迫的还是自愿的。但这绝不仅仅是与意大利社会、其传统和趋势格格不入的条顿怪癖。这种说法可以毫无问题地融入到意大利更广泛的法律管辖领域的扩大，以及法律原则的全面化中（这会让我们再次遇到鲁曼，意大利左翼右翼的新权威）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Es liegt jedenfalls kein Zufall vor, wenn sich die öffentliche Meinung in Deutschland nicht sonderlich um die Garantie der Bürgerrechte sorgt. Abgesehen von der Ratlosigkeit und der Verblüffung der intellektuellen und teilweise auch der gewerkschaftlichen Linken sowie der direkt betroffenen alternativen Bewegungen: die Massenmedien, die verfassungstreuen Parteien und die sogenannten „tragenden gesellschaftlichen Kräfte” (christliche Kirchen und sonstige religiöse Gemeinden, Sportvereine, Automobilclubs, Universitäten, Bundeswehr und Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) sehen in diesem Bereich keine Probleme. Für die Mehrheit, nicht die schweigende, die eher skeptisch ist, sondern die geschwätzige der Tageszeitungen und Illustrierten, des Fernsehens und der zahllosen Lokalblätter ist die Bundesrepublik identisch mit einem Staat, in dem die Grundrechte genau und umfassend verwirklicht sind. Sie ist „der freieste Staat der deutschen Geschichte”, wie der unvermeidliche Genscher schon sagte. Dies klänge ohne weiteres überzeugend, wenn es nicht verlegene Zweifel an der Qualität der deutschen Geschichte aufkommen ließe. Ob die Behauptung übrigens der Wahrheit entspricht, wäre noch zu untersuchen. Die Weimarer Republik war sicherlich „freier” als die Bonner, so daß gesagt wurde, sie sei an einem Übermaß an Freiheit zugrundegegangen. Sogar das Kaiserreich zeigte in einigen Aspekten liberalere Züge und einen größeren Respekt für bestimmte verfassungsrechtliche Grundpfeiler als Bonn. Man denke an das Verbot der SPD durch Bismarck, das die Sozialdemokraten weder von der Teilnahme an Wahlen ausschloß noch ihnen ihre Reichstagsmandate suspendierte. Das KPD-Verbot in dem „freiesten Staat der deutschen Geschichte” untersagte hingegen den Kommunisten jede Beteiligung am öffentlich-politischen Leben und kassierte die Parlamentssitze ein, die die KPD in freien und geheimen Wahlen gewonnen hatte. Schon wegen dieser Erbsünde zieht das staatspolitische Deutschland es vor, über Hindernisse im Gebrauch der Freiheit, über deren Reduktion auf ein bloßes Verfassungspostulat und auf politische Ritualisierung zu schweigen. Umso lebhafter ist das Interesse an der, für die Rechtsstaatlichkeit als notwendig erachteten, Begrenzung der Grundrechte. Damit verbindet sich im politischen Alltag eine beachtliche juristische Verschiebung. Um ihre Reichweite zu begreifen, genügt es, in den konservativen Tageszeitungen die Leitartikel zu lesen, die sich gegen Vorschläge und Arbeitshypothesen aus dem Spektrum des Dissenses wenden. Es steht außer Frage, daß dahinter die brennende Sorge um die gebotene Verteidigung der Verfassung gegen innerstaatlichen Feind steckt. In diesem Sinne fragt man sich etwa, ob nicht schon die Veröffentlichung der radikalen Kritik die verfassungsmäßig gesetzten Grenzen der freien Meinungsäußerung überschreite, sich damit außerhalb des Erlaubten und Legalen stelle. Die freie politische Meinungsäußerung würde derart ohne alle Befangenheit zum Gegenstand legitimer rechtlicher Verfolgung: ein verallgemeinerter 7. April, ein zur historischen Würde einer Charaktermaske des Rechtsstaats erhobener Calogero.5 Die Perspektive ändert sich, wenn man zum Problem des Rechts der Subjekte übergeht und dabei die Identität von legitimer und legaler Machtausübung näher betrachtet. Um die Sache selbst noch einmal zusammenzufassen: Der Staat ist Rechtsstaat nur insoweit, als seine Macht nicht legibus soluta ist, sondern sich an allgemeine Gesetze rückkoppelt. (Da fügt sich die mitteleuropäische Tradition, wenn auch zuweilen in einseitiger, „moderner” Weise in die geschichtliche Entwicklung des Westens ein). Nicht nur Exekutive und Verwaltung werden im voraus funktional gebunden und unterliegen der Formbestimmtheit streng kodifizierter Regeln (Max Webers großartige Konzeption, neuerdings von Luhmann aufs Mittelmaß gebracht). Die gleiche Gebundenheit gilt auch für die Legislative, die nicht „beschließen kann, was sie will” - wie es für das frühere englische Parlament hieß. Daraus erklärt sich auch die übermäßige Bedeutung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts im politischen System der Bundesrepublik. Da dieses Gericht sowohl in den Gesetzgebungsprozeß wie in die Beschlüsse der Exeku tive in entscheidendem Maße eingreifen kann (indem bekannt lich mit dem Instrument des Verfassungsurteils der Inhalt einer künftigen Gesetzesregelung im voraus geklärt wird), gewann das Verfassungsgericht allmählich die Qualität eines „zweiten politischen Systems” und transzendierte legislative wie exeku tive Befugnisse. Derart finden eigenmächtige Maßnahmen und Ausnahmeentscheidungen ohne konstitutionell abgesicherte Gesetzesför-migkeit in der Bundesrepublik einfach nicht statt. Sie gelten als illegitim und illegal und verschwinden von der staatlichen Bühne. Damit steht allerdings gegen alle Mißverständnisse und Kritik fest: bei aller Geringschätzung der subjektiven Rechte und bei aller Reduktion der Freiheit ereignet sich Willkürherrschaft im konkreten Verstand des Wortes im Regierungssystem der Bundesrepublik nicht. Auf dieser Ebene vollzieht sich aber in formell unanfechtbarer Weise die Transformation des Rechtsstaats in den Gesetzesstaat. Es handelt sich dabei freilich nicht um einen Übergang, der auf den Bereich rein rechtlicher Problematik sich beschränkte und daher rein ideologischer, belangloser Natur wäre. Die Transformation bildet den normativen Teil einer komplexen Wirklichkeit und eines die Ideologie umfassenden Rahmens in dem wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Erfordernisse in Normativität gegossen werden und sich auf diese Weise eine ideelle Würde zulegen. Das will heißen: in dieser Transformation findet die Verdinglichung als Verrechtli-chung der Produktions- und Reproduktionsverhältnisse ihre eigene staatliche Form der Zusammenfassung. In ihr werden alle Beschlüsse, Regeln, alle Politik als interessenunabhängig ausgegeben - wie die Ware sich auf dem Markt jenseits allen Verdachts des Profits und des Betrugs zu bewegen scheint. Die Annahme, der ganze Prozeß vollzöge sich - übrigens der gesellschaftlichen Neutralität des Staates entsprechend - in der Immanenz des Gesetzes, ergibt sich genau aus dem normativen Schein, das Gesetz selbst sei materialiter an das bonum comune zurückgebunden. Dieses gilt aber formell (per definitionem) als von allem Partikularwillen frei und erhebt sich über das „System der Bedürfnisse” (des alten Hegel, um uns recht zu verstehen). Das Gesetz ist notorisch für alle gleich: eine universelle Bindung, vor der auch die Macht sich verantworten muß. Also eine im Begriff verkürzte, beinahe aristotelische Konzeption.6 Ein gleichwie bestimmtes System der Macht erkennt sich im Gesetz und beansprucht für sich die Legitimität einer lückenlosen Legalität. In der Tat: wenn das Gesetz und nicht ein Einzelner, eine Gruppe oder eine Klasse im politischen Gemeinwesen die Herrschaft ausübt, vermählen sich Legalität und Legitimität in unauflöslicher Weise - geradezu katholisch. „Norm\\" und „Wirklichkeit\\" Die Kritik der politikwissenschaftlichen Schule Wolfgang Abendroths am Bonner Regierungssystem versucht in erster Linie, die Diskrepanz zwischen Verfassungsnorm und Verfassungswirklichkeit aufzuzeigen.7 Politisch ist das Vorhaben sicher nützlich; es trifft auch ein wichtiges Problem. Bei den Politikern herrscht heimlich das reine, unbekümmerte Machtkalkül vor, dem Konstitutionalität wenig bedeutet. In Abendroths Sicht indes bleibt die Übereinstimmung der beiden Pole eine ideale Zielsetzung. An ihr sollten die Handlungsweise der Politiker und der institutionelle Alltag gemessen werden. Dadurch gelingt es ihr nicht, in der funktionalen Einheit von Norm und Wirklichkeit das Wesenselement, den harten Kern der Politik eines Verfassungsstaats zu erkennen. Der regelgebundene, normative Charakter der Staatsführung und -Verwaltung setzt sich meist in die wirkliche Ausübung politischer Macht um. Und der wirkliche Gebrauch der Gewalt findet auf einer anderen Ebene seine Begründung in der Verfassungsnorm des Gewaltmonopols. Für diese Art von Politik charakterisiert den Rechtsstaat nicht so sehr der Inhalt (die Garantie der Grundrechte), für den die politische Macht eingesetzt wird, sondern die Form: die Form Recht. Die allgemeine Form wird nicht angeschlagen, geschweige denn gebrochen von einem, nur dem Staat eigenen Recht, das von der Politik wahrgenommen und ausgeübt wird. ”翻译为中文","completion":"在德国，公众舆论对保障公民权利并不特别担心，这绝非巧合。除了知识分子和部分工会左翼，以及直接受影响的另类运动的困惑和惊讶之外：大众媒体、遵守宪法的政党和所谓的“主要社会力量”（基督教教会和其他宗教团体、体育俱乐部、汽车俱乐部、大学、联邦军队和德国工业联合会）在这个领域看不到任何问题。对于大多数人来说，不是默然的、而是持怀疑态度的，而是每日报纸和杂志、电视和无数地方报纸的喧嚣之声，联邦共和国与一个基本权利得到准确和全面实现的国家是一致的。正如不可避免的根舍尔所说，它是“德国历史上最自由的国家”。如果不是让人对德国历史的质量产生尴尬的怀疑，这听起来无疑是令人信服的。无论如何，这个说法是否真实，还有待调查。魏玛共和国肯定比波恩更“自由”，以至于有人说，它因为自由过度而灭亡。即使是帝国时期在某些方面也表现出更自由的特质，对某些宪法基石的尊重超过波恩。想想俾斯麦对社会民主党的禁止，并没有阻止社会民主党参加选举或暂停他们的国会席位。相反，“德国历史上最自由的国家”中的共产党禁令却禁止了共产党参与公共政治生活，并取消了共产党通过自由和秘密选举赢得的议会席位。正因为这个原始罪，德国的国家政策更愿意对自由使用的障碍、自由被简化为单纯的宪法口号和政治仪式化保持沉默。 对于被认为对法治至关重要的基本权利的限制，兴趣就更为浓厚了。这与日常政治中的一项重要法律转变相结合。为了理解其范围，只需阅读保守派日报上，针对持不同政见者谱系中提出的提议和工作假设的社论便足够了。毫无疑问，这背后是对守护宪法免受国内敌人攻击的迫切担忧。在这种意义上，人们可能会问，激进批评的发表是否已经超出了宪法设定的言论自由限制，从而置身于允许和合法的范围之外。这样，自由的政治言论表达就毫无顾忌地成为合法追究的对象：一个推广到了历史地位的、“法治国家特质化”的741号行动，卡洛杰罗。 当转向讨论个体权利问题并进一步考察合法和合理权力行使的身份时，视角就发生了变化。再次总结一下这个问题：国家之所以是法治国家，就在于其权力不是legibus soluta（不受法律约束），而是与普遍的法律相连。（这也是中欧传统，尽管有时以一种片面的、“现代”的方式融入西方历史发展中）。不仅行政和管理机构事先功能性地受到约束，服从于严格规范化规则的形式决定性（马克斯·韦伯的宏伟构想，最近被卢曼降级）。对于立法机构也同样适用，它不能“随心所欲地决定”——正如过去英国议会所说。这也解释了为何在德国联邦共和国政治系统中，联邦宪法法院的重要性如此之大。因为这个法院可以在立法过程中以及在执行机构的决定中起到决定性的作用（众所周知，通过使用宪法裁决工具，未来法规的内容被预先澄清），联邦宪法法院逐渐获得了一个“第二政治系统”的定性，超越了立法和行政的权力。 因此，在德国联邦共和国简单地不存在未经宪法保护的法律形式的专断措施和例外决定。它们被视为非法和非法，从国家舞台上消失。尽管存在所有的误解和批评，但确立了一点：尽管轻视了主观权利并将自由缩减，但在德国联邦共和国的政府系统中，确切意义上的专制统治并不存在。然而，在这个层面上，法治国家以形式无可争议的方式转变为了法律国家。这当然不是一个仅限于纯法律问题领域的转变，因此是纯粹意识形态上的、无关紧要的。这种转变构成了一个复杂现实和包含意识形态框架的规范部分，在其中经济和社会需求被法定化，并以这种方式获得了一种理想的尊严。这意味着：在这次转变中，作为生产和再生产关系的财物化以法律化的形式找到了它自己的国家形式的归纳。在它们中，所有的决策、规则、所有的政策都被公布为独立于利益之外——就像商品在市场上移动时似乎超越了利润和欺诈的怀疑一样。 这个全过程发生的假设——顺便说一句，这与国家的社会中立性相符——正是源于法律本身的规范性幻觉，即法律在物质上被束缚于bonum comune（共同利益）。但这仅在形式上（根据定义）被认为是自由于一切特殊意志之上，并超越了“需求系统”（为了我们更好地理解，这里引用古老的黑格尔）。法律显然对所有人都是相同的：一种普遍的约束，即便是权力本身也必须对此负责。因此，这是一个在观念上简化的、几乎是亚里士多德式的概念。一个确定的权力系统在法律中看到自己，并为自己声称连续不断的合法性的合法性。实际上：如果政治联合体由法律而不是个人、团队或阶级统治，合法性和合法性就以一种不可分割的方式结合在一起——几乎是天主教式的。 “规范”与“现实” 沃尔夫冈·阿本德罗特的政治学学派对波恩政府系统的批评主要试图揭示宪法规范与宪法现实之间的差距。在政治上，这项工作肯定是有用的；它也触及了一个重要问题。在政治家中，纯粹、毫无顾忌的权力计算占据着主导地位，对于宪政性意味着很少。然而，在阿本德罗特的观点中，两极的符合仍然是一个理想的目标。政治家的行为方式和机构的日常应以此为衡量。因此，它未能在规范和现实的功能统一中识别出宪法国家政治的本质元素，即政治的核心。规范引导的国家治理和管理的性质通常转化为政治权力的真实行使。而真正的暴力使用在宪法规茨的暴力垄断规定中找到了另一个层面的基础。对于这种类型的政治来说，法治国家的特色不太是政治权力被用来保障的内容（基本权利的保障），而是形式：法律的形式。通用形式不被特权的、仅属于国家的权利所挑战，也不被打破，这些权利由政治注意到并实施。"},{"prompt":"请将“Wichtig ist dabei, daß sie mindestens intentional (die Intention wird aber fast durchweg verwirklicht) die Norm nicht verläßt. Der politische Wille wird also nicht - wie Abendroth annahm - von der Indifferenz der Norm gegenüber bestimmt, sondern von dem Auftrag, sie zu wahren; sie freilich auch zu ändern, falls sich dies (wie oben ange merkt) als notwendig erweisen sollte, um die substantielle Di mension der Norm aufrechtzuerhalten. Im Grunde geht es um eine altbekannte politische Aufgabe: um den Versuch, zwischen realen Erfordernissen und mehr oder weniger heiligen Prinzi pien zu vermitteln. Und bürgerliche Gesellschaften wissen diese Aufgabe vortrefflich zu erfüllen. Die Vermittlung spielt sich auf der Basis der zweideutigen Identität des (idealen) Rechtsstaats mit dem (realen) System ab. Daß sie auch dazu dient, sporadische und vorübergehende, obzwar wichtige Ungereimtheiten in die Ordnung zurückzuführen, wurde seinerzeit von Alfred Dregger, dem vormaligen Fraktionsführer der CDU im Bundestag, offen und vielleicht naiv demonstriert. Dregger schlug vor,8 im Kampf gegen den Terrorismus zu harten Ausnahmeregelungen zu greifen, die mit dem Grundgesetz kaum zu vereinbaren gewesen wären. Er erkannte gleichzeitig an, daß derlei Methoden die normative Glaubwürdigkeit des Staats schwer kompromittiert hätten. Wie ließ sich das Knäuel nur entwirren, wie ein Ausweg finden, eine Ausnahme in eine normgerechte Regel zu übersetzen? Nach dem bisher Gesagten handelte es sich offensichtlich darum, die entsprechende Verfahrensmethode zu finden. Ich muß etwas weiter ausholen, um verständlich zu machen, daß es hier nicht um bloße Ideologie geht, sondern um praktizierte Politik mit Alltagscharakter. So erregte es beispielsweise nicht weiter Erstaunen,9 daß das vom Land Baden-Württemberg angerufene Verwaltungsgericht zu Mannheim einen Journalisten wegen Verumglipfung des Staates verurteilte, weil es ihn für schuldig befand, die Politik des Ministerpräsidenten des Landes, des „furchtbaren Juristen” Filbinger, kritisiert zu haben.10 Die Urteilsbegründung entsprach dem sogenannten allgemeinen Rechtsempfinden: da in der Bundesrepublik Übereinstimmung zwischen der Idee der Demokratie und den liberaldemokratischen Prinzipien auf der einen Seite, der Verwirklichung von Idee und Prinzip auf der anderen Seite existiere, die auch weithin von der Bevölkerung anerkannt sei, bedeute jede Kritik vorhandener politischer Verhältnisse, Maßnahmen und Motivationen de facto einen Angriff gegen den demokratischen und rechtsstaatlichen Charakter der Republik Nun zurück zu Dregger und zu seinem Problem, ein für den Rechtsstaat unerträgliches Ausnahmegesetz in den Rang der Verfassungsmäßigkeit zu heben. Die Dreggersche Lösung beugt weder das Prinzip der Normengebundenheit, noch versucht sie sich in jenen transformistischen Winkelzügen und institutionalisierten Hinterhältigkeiten, mit deren Hilfe Italiens politische Klasse ihre Schwierigkeiten meistert. Sie hält sich strikt an die Verfassung und folgt dem Verfahren für mögliche Grundgesetzänderungen peinlich genau. Das Grundgesetz kennt und definiert eine Grenze zur Verfassungswidrigkeit der Änderungen. Material geschützt und mit „Ewigkeitswert” versehen sind bekanntlich nur Art. 1 und Art. 20 GG, also der ideelle Zweck des Staats und seine formale Gestalt: Föderalismus, soziale Rechtsstaatlichkeit, die Gebundenheit der drei Gewalten, die Volkssouveränität und ihre repräsentative Entmachtung. Alle anderen Bestimmungen stehen zur Disposition. Ihr Schutz, der Schutz vor beliebigen Änderungen durch beliebige Regierungsmehrheiten, liegt einzig in den Händen der qualifizierten Zweidrittelmehrheit des Bundestags - liegt also im parlamentarischen Quorum. In Dreggers Sicht hängt die Verfassungsmäßigkeit der Integration einer Ausnahme in die Regel nicht mit dem Inhalt der Ausnahme zusammen, sondern von der Erzielung des Regelquorums ab. Da derart die Form Recht sich durchsetzt, findet die Wirklichkeit zur Norm; und die Norm ihre Verwirklichung. Mit dem instrumentell-taktischen Charakter der Dregger-schen Vorschläge halte ich mich nicht weiter auf;11 ihre Bedeutung liegt eher in einem anderen Aspekt. Auf den ersten Blick scheint sich in den Argumenten, die die westdeutsche Krisendiskussion bestimmen, eine Art theoretische Verwirrung zu manifestieren, ein Mangel an konzeptueller und kategorialer Genauigkeit. Dahinter steckt indessen die klare, genau bestimmte Bezugnahme auf eine konkrete historische Situation. Auf der ideologischen Ebene der Konsensbildung trägt diese Verfahrensweise einerseits zur politischen Stabilität bei, andererseits zur besseren Identifizierung des inneren Feindes. Nicht nur vollziehen sich Entscheidungsprozesse streng nach der Verfassung und ergibt sich aus dieser Einheit von Norm und Wirklichkeit die demokratische Glaubwürdigkeit der politischen Kräfte. Darüberhinaus, wie der Fall des Mannheimer Urteilsspruchs zeigt, wird die durchgängige Identität der Politik mit dem Ideal zur gegebenen Faktizität. Und genau daraus folgt, daß der Verdacht, sich außerhalb des Rechtsstaats zu stellen, unvermeidbar den trifft, der außerhalb des Machtsystems gesellschaftspolitisch handelt. Das Außerinstitutionelle wird zum Synonym der Feindschaft gegen die Freiheit - eine interessante Umkehrung der Fronten, in der der konsequenten Opposition auch moralisch vorgeworfen werden kann, Bürgerrechte, Menschenrechte, die Demokratie, das Zusammenleben, alle Schöne und Gute zu bekämpfen. In dieser Verkehrung sehen die Vertreter der bestehenden Ordnung keine Spur einer Krise: weder der Normativität, noch der Wirklichkeit, noch weniger des Gewissens.12 Das heißt: die Bundesrepublik Deutschland, so wie sie leibt und lebt, so wie sie in voller Achtung vor dem Gesetz für sozialen Frieden, für Ausgewogenheit und Interessenausgleich sorgt und ihre präventiven und defensiven Mittel gegen den inneren Feind entwickelt und einsetzt, ist der Rechtsstaat. Steht in diesem Zusammenhang fest, daß der Rechtsstaat sich als Einschränkung der Demokratie darstellt, vor allem als Einschränkung der Volkssouveränität, so mag dies vordergründig der „tedescheria”, der Deutschtümelei, zugewiesen werden. Deutschland ist jedoch kein Sonderfall. Wir haben es hier mit dem verborgenen, historisch und logisch gültigen Sinn der Verfassung eines bürgerlichen Staats zu tun, in dessen normgerechte Wirklichkeit die Volkssouveränität sich in bloße Annahme oder Fiktion verflüchtigt.13 In der Feststellung, der Rechtsstaat beschneide die Souveränität des Volkes und setze sich selber als Souverän, liegt nichts Neues oder Ungewohntes. Sie trifft einfach zu und weist auf keinen Normenbruch hin. Dies bedeutet ein Schlichtes: der Rechtsstaat weist sich in Übereinstimmung mit sich selber als eine Instanz aus, die zwar die Ordnung, aber nicht die subjektiven Rechte (die Grundrechte) garantiert. Doppeldeutigkeit der Verfassung Auf der brüchigen Ebene der von der Macht gesicherten individuellen Spielräume ereignen sich förmlich die Verschränkung und zugleich der Zusammenstoß zweier materiell getrennter Prinzipien, die jeden Verfassungsstaat aufspalten - genauer: die Form Staat als solche, sofern sie durch eine freiheitliche Verfassungsordnung gestaltet wird, die sich ständig in institutionelle Herrschaftsmechanismen umsetzt. Der Zusammenstoß erfolgt entlang des inzwischen geklärten Gegensatzes zwischen dem subjektiven und dem objektiven (Staats)Recht. In ihm widerspiegelt sich die Widersprüchlichkeit, aber ebenso die strategische Doppeldeutigkeit in der historischen Politik des Kapitalismus. Auf der einen (ideologischen) Seite konstituierte und rekonstituiert sich der bürgerliche Staat als Erfüllung allgemein menschlicher Bestrebungen; auf der anderen Seite als (mate-riale) in Gesetze gegossene Herrschaft „des Menschen über den Menschen”. Nun: „Nur das Gesetz kann uns die Freiheit geben”, meinte schon Goethe (obwohl es auch nach Schiller klingelt). Zweifellos hängt bürgerliche Herrschaft mit Freiheit zusammen. In der Geschichte befreite die Bourgeoisie sich selbst, als sie die politischen Zwangsbahnen des Absolutismus und die korporativen Schranken der vorkapitalistischen Zeit durchbrach. Nach wie vor tritt sie für unbegrenzte Akkumulation ein, das freie Tauschverhältnis, die Wettbewerbsfreiheit des Marktes - alles gekoppelt mit den Freiheitsrechten und der Rechtsgleichheit, worin wir das wiedererkennen, was ich vorhin das eine Prinzip der Verfassung nannte; und worin auch das großartige Verdienst der bürgerlichen Revolution liegt. ”翻译为中文","completion":"其中重要的是，她至少在意图上（而意图几乎总是实现的）不脱离规范。因此，政治意愿不是由阿本德罗特所认为的规范的冷漠决定的，而是由维护它的任务决定的；当然，如果必要的话，也会改变规范（如上所述），以维持规范的实质维度。本质上，这是一个众所周知的政治任务：尝试在现实需求与或多或少神圣的原则之间进行调解。而且，资本主义社会很好地履行了这一任务。 调解建立在（理想的）法治国家与（现实的）体系之间的双重身份基础上。正如阿尔弗雷德·德雷格尔，前基督教民主联盟（CDU）在联邦议院的党团领袖，当时公开且可能天真地显示的那样，调解还有助于将偶然和短暂的，尽管重要的不一致性纳入秩序。德雷格尔建议，在打击恐怖主义的斗争中采取严厉的例外规则，这些规则几乎无法与基本法相容。他同时承认，这样的方法严重损害了国家的规范信誉。如何解开这个难题呢，如何找到一条路径，将例外转化为符合规范的常规呢？据之前所述，显然是要找到相应的程序方法。 我需要详细说明一点，这里不仅仅是关于意识形态，而是关于有日常特征的实际政治。例如，引起了轰动的是巴登-符腾堡州请求的曼海姆行政法院判定一名记者因诽谤国家而有罪，因为他被认为批评了该州州长、\\"可怕的法学家\\"菲尔宾格的政策。判决的理由符合所谓的一般法律观感：因为在联邦共和国，民主的理念与自由民主原则之间、理念与原则的实现之间存在一致性，这也被广泛公众认可，任何对现有政治状况、措施和动机的批评实际上都等同于攻击共和国的民主和法治特性。现在回到德雷格尔和他将不可忍受的例外法提升为宪法合法性的问题。德雷格尔的解决方案既没有弯曲规范的原则，也没有尝试那些意大利政治阶层通常解决问题的变形把戏和制度化的诡计。它严格遵守宪法，并严格遵循可能的基本法修改程序。基本法知道并定义了修改可能违宪的界限。众所周知，只有第1条和第20条是物质上受到保护并拥有\\"永恒价值\\"，即国家的理想目的和其形式结构：联邦制、社会法治、三权制约、人民主权及其代表性剥夺。所有其他条款都是可以讨论的。它们免受任意政府多数随意修改的保护，仅仅取决于联邦议院所需的资格性三分之二多数——因此取决于议会的法定人数。在德雷格尔看来，将例外整合入规则的宪法合法性不取决于例外的内容，而是取决于达到规则法定人数。因此，由于法律形式得以实施，现实得以规范化；规范得以实现。 我不会详细讨论德雷格尔提议的工具-战术性质；它们的重要性在于另一个方面。乍一看，西德危机讨论中的论点似乎表现出某种理论上的混乱，缺乏概念和分类的准确性。然而，背后却是对具体历史情境的清晰、精确的关联。在共识形成的意识形态层面上，这种做法一方面有助于政治稳定，另一方面有助于更好地识别内部敌人。不仅决策过程严格遵循宪法，并且这种规范与现实的统一赋予了政治力量民主信誉。此外，如曼海姆判决案例所示，政治与理想的连贯性成为既定事实。正是因为如此，怀疑站在法治国家之外的人，不可避免地会影响到那些在社会政治系统之外行动的人。站在体制外成了对自由的敌对的同义词——这是一种有趣的前线转换，其中可以在道德上指责一贯的反对派反对公民权利、人权、民主、共同生活、所有美好事物。在这种转换中，现有秩序的代表没有看到任何危机的迹象：无论是规茨的危机，现实的危机，还是良知的危机。这意味着：联邦共和国德国，正如其实际存在的，正如其全面尊重法律为社会和平、平衡和利益协调所做的努力，并发展和使用预防和防御手段对抗内部敌人，就是法治国家。 在这种背景下，法治国家显现为民主的限制，尤其是人民主权的限制，这可能首先被归咎于“德国特性”。然而，德国并非特例。我们在这里面对的是资本主义国家宪法的隐藏、历史和逻辑上有效意义，其中人民主权在符合规范的现实中消散成仅仅是假设或虚构。 声明法治国家削弱了人民的主权并将自己设为主权者，并不是什么新鲜事或不寻常的事。这是简单的事实，而且并未指向任何规范的违背。这意味着一个简单的事实：法治国家表明，与自身一致地，它是一个确保秩序而非主观权利（基本权利）保障的实体。 宪法的双重性 在权力保障的个体自由空间的脆弱层面上，两个在实质上分离的原则的交织和碰撞正式发生，这两个原则是分裂任何宪法国家的——更准确地说，是分裂作为国家形式本身，只要它通过自由的宪法秩序来塑造，不断转化为制度化的统治机制。这种碰撞沿着现已明确的主观与客观（国家）权利之间的对立发生。在其中反映了矛盾，但同样反映了资本主义历史政治中的战略性双重性。在一方面（意识形态方面），资产阶级国家作为全人类追求的实现而建立和重新建立；另一方面作为（物质上）“人对人的统治”法律化的统治。“只有法律能给我们自由”，歌德曾经这样认为（虽然这也听起来像是席勒的话）。无疑，资产阶级统治与自由相关联。在历史上，资产阶级在打破了绝对主义的政治束缚和前资本主义时期的社团限制时解放了自己。至今，它仍为无限积累、自由交换关系、市场竞争自由——所有这些都与自由权利和法律平等相结合，我们在其中重新认识到我之前所说的宪法的一个原则；这也是资产阶级革命的伟大成就。"},{"prompt":"请将“Allerdings taucht schon hier ein Grundelement des anderen Prinzips auf: der „freie Arbeitsvertrag zwischen Gleichen”, der für die kapitalistische Produktion konstitutiv und für die bürgerliche Verfassung emblematisch ist. Bekanntlich werden von Seiten des Kapitals immer nur die Verkaufsbedingungen der Arbeitskraft zum Gegenstand des freien Vertrags, nicht aber die vertragliche Regelung der ökonomischen Beziehungen selbst und eines auf Gleichheit beruhenden gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisses. Einfach ausgedrückt: beide Teile schließen einen Vertrag über den Preis der Arbeit; die Struktur der Befehlsgewalt übe ie Arbeit bleibt unangetastet. Damit baut die Bourgeoisie das System der eigenen Macht aus, ihrem eigenen Interesse und der Logik ihrer Freiheit gemäß. Nachdem sie die Rechte aller Menschen proklamiert hat, „macht sie sich zum Staat” und konstruiert gewissermaßen das zweite bestimmende Verfassungsprinzip. Bestätigung und Kodifizierung der Freiheitsrechte werden durch Zwangsnormen ergänzt und umstrukturiert, die die Organisation und Reproduktion der Gesellschaft regeln und die Weiterexistenz des Kapitals selbst sichern. Eine notwendige konstitutionelle Bestimmung, da das Kapital über eine Mehrheit des Geldes, nicht aber der Stimmen verfügt. Eigentümlicherweise haben wir hier schon das ganze Problem, das den Rechtsstaat in eine denkbar heikle Position bringt. Das gilt vor allem in Zeiten, in denen die politische Klasse sich mit der endgültigen Perspektivwahl konfrontiert sieht: entweder genügt sie ihrer ideellen Aufgabe und verteidigt die subjektiven Rechte (der zahlenmäßigen Mehrheit gegen die zahlungskräftige Minderheit); oder sie erfüllt ihren sozialen Auftrag, die Reproduktion einer bestimmten Art gesellschaftlicher Verhältnisse zu organisieren und eine bestimmte ökonomische Zweckbestimmtheit zu gewährleisten. Was tun? Die Sphäre der Autonomie, der individuellen und kollektiven Freiheit ausdehnen; oder den Sicherheitsapparat verstärken und die Kontrolle über die Gesellschaft intensivieren? Mehr Emanzipation oder mehr Ordnungskräfte? Zugegebenermaßen ist es Rhetorik, dem bürgerlichen Staat mit der Alternative von Akkumulation oder Emanzipation zu kommen. Ihm - der Form Staat überhaupt - gilt Emanzipation bekanntlich nur als auflösendes Element, das nur Kontrolle und Einsperrung verdient. Dennoch gibt es auf einer mittleren Linie eine Vermittlung: Jedem Zugeständnis in Sachen Autonomie entspricht eine neue Umdrehung der Schraube der Macht. Diese frißt gegebenenfalls die Konzessionen wieder auf, zieht gewissermaßen fiskalisch die subjektiven Rechte wieder ein und gibt den Leuten zu verstehen, daß der Rechtsstaat jederzeit befugt ist, das Gewaltmonopol in die Festlegung alltäglicher Strukturen von Einordnung und Unterordnung zu übersetzen, innerhalb derer nur der Bürger seine eigene Existenz genießen kann.14 Also: „Alles im Staat, nichts außerhalb des Staats”, wie es bei Mussolini hieß? Aber die historische Reminiszenz kann in die Irre führen,15 auch wenn in der Bundesrepublik die Lage der politischen Kritik allemal unsicher bleibt. Freilich wurde sie inzwischen scheinbar durch die „grünen” Erfolge stabilisiert, das heißt: durch die institutionalisierte Präsenz eines zwar nicht gerade radikalen Dissenses, aber wenigstens eines diffusen Unbehagens. Darüber jedoch schwebt die Drohung des wenig bekannten Artikels 18 GG, der eine radikale Opposition ins Außerhalb des sorgfältig gehüteten Verfassungsrahmens befördern könnte. Und es erscheint mir reichlich bezeichnend für die strategische Doppeldeutigkeit der Verfassung, daß gerade Art. 18 so selten in politischen Diskussionen, aber auch in wissenschaftlichen Analysen berücksichtigt wird.16 Dabei legt er den Verlust der Grundrechte für „Feinde der Verfassung” fest und dekretiert, wohlgemerkt durch eine Verfassungsnorm, die Möglichkeit, jene Rechte zu verwirken, die das Grundgesetz selbst in der Präambel als unveräußerlich deklariert hatte. Art.18 bietet im Grunde den Beweis einer Dominanz der Macht über die Garantie im Rahmen der Verfassung selbst. Er ist die normative Demonstration dafür, daß dem real existierenden Rechtsstaat die immer wieder unablässig betonten Rechte letztlich als Zugeständnis gelten und also widerruflich sind. Ich füge allerdings zur Klärung hinzu, daß die Vorherrschaft des Staates als des Organisators der Gesellschaft zwar zu einer solchen Einschränkung subjektiver Rechte führt; daß diese Einschränkung aber mit dem freiheitlich sein wollenden Charakter des subjektiven Rechts übereinstimmt, wenn der Einzelne sich ihr freiwillig unterwirft. Wiederum: ich spreche nicht von einem theoretischen Kon-strukt, sondern von der Wirklichkeit eines als Modellfall geltenden Deutschland. Diese Situation dürfte sich bei einem Regierungswechsel ebensowenig ändern wie bei einer Hinwendung der Grünen zu einer entschiedeneren Opposition.17 Das Problem ist im Kontext unserer Fragestellung ohnehin ein anderes. Wenn die Bürgerrechte in den Dienst der konstituierten Macht gestellt und für die Verfahrenskorrektheit der Institutionen funktionalisiert werden, fallen ihre Verteidigung (die Rechtsgarantien) und die Verteidigung des verfaßten Staats zusammen. Sie werden zu einem Element des Staatsschutzes. Ich werde noch einmal darauf zu sprechen kommen. Halten wir zunächst fest, daß auch hier der Staat sich durchaus als Rechtsgarant behauptet: er garantiert förmlich sich selbst, gewiß nicht als totalitäre Wesenheit, als Hegeische objektivierte Idee oder als Spinozische Substanz. Vielmehr gewährleistet er in seiner technischen, sozioökonomischen und normativen Formbestimmtheit die materiellen Strukturen, deren Funktionär er ist. Der materielle Aspekt selbst braucht nicht weiter erörtert zu werden. Er soll auch nicht in einer Richtung vertieft werden, die auf den „Staat des Kapitals” zurückweist.18 Der Genauigkeit halber sei aber daran erinnert, daß nicht alle Angriffe und alle Kritik der „Bürger” an Politik und Machtmißbrauch, an Widrigkeiten des Marktes und an ökonomisch-politischem Schwindel als direkt staatsgefährdend gelten, sondern nur solche Formen der Kritik, des Angriffs und des Protestes, die sich unbefangen und unverhohlen gegen Kapital und Staat wenden. Nicht zufällig trafen die Berufsverbote, die amtlich beide Extremismen (von rechts und von links) meinen sollten, in Wirklichkeit vor allem die Linke. Dies aus gutem Grund, einer politischen Logik folgend, die sich bruchlos in die Logik des Kapitals einfügt. Denn faktisch greift die Rechte, vor allem die offen faschistische (die Lipset übrigens soziologisch als „Extremismus der Mitte” bezeichnete) fraglos bestimmte Regeln der Politik und des institutionellen Spiels, also die berühmten „Spielregeln der Demokratie” an. Sie versucht sich in der totalen Wachablösung und will im Kontext einer durchgängigen Auswechselung innerhalb der politischen Klasse an die Stelle der bisherigen Machthaber treten. Und sie „macht” ihre institutionelle Revolution, wie andere ihre Reformen „machen”. Bei aller noch so extremen Änderung der politischen Form (und im historischen Faschismus trotz des Übergangs zu terroristischen Maßnahmen) läßt die Rechte die Produktionsweise unangetastet und will sie sogar durch einen lückenlosen sozialen Frieden, das heißt durch Ausschaltung sprengender Konflikte zusätzlich sichern. Die Rechte läßt die „Form der Zusammenfassung” der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nicht nur in Ruhe. Sie zementiert sie überdies. Kein Faschismus setzt sich je ein Ende des allgemeinen Tauschverhältnisses zum Ziel und führt einen radikalen Kurswechsel im Produktionszweck selbst herbei, geschweige denn das Ende der Herrschaftsstrukturen. Er will also von einer Aufhebung des Staates nichts wissen und negiert selbst die Möglichkeit einer sofortigen oder allmählichen Überwindung des objektiven Zwangscharakters gesellschaftlicher Prozesse.”翻译为中文","completion":"不过，这里已经出现了另一原则的基本元素：“平等之间的自由劳动合同”，这对于资本主义生产是构成性的，对于资产阶级宪法而言是标志性的。众所周知，资本方始终只将劳动力的销售条件作为自由合同的对象，而不是合同本身对经济关系及基于平等的社会关系的规定。简单来说：双方就劳动的价格达成合同；对于劳动的指挥结构则保持不变。通过这种方式，资产阶级根据自己的利益和自由逻辑，扩展了自己权力的体系。宣布了所有人的权利之后，资产阶级“成为国家”，并以这种方式构建了第二个决定性的宪法原则。自由权利的确认和编纂通过补充和重组那些规范，这些规范规定了社会的组织和再生产，保证了资本本身的持续存在。这是一个必要的宪法规定，因为资本拥有大多数的金钱，而非票数。 奇怪的是，这里已经展示了让法治国家处于十分微妙位置的整个问题。这在政治阶级面对最终选择的前景时尤其如此：要么履行其理想任务并捍卫主观权利（数目上的多数对抗有支付能力的少数）；要么完成其社会任务，组织特定类型的社会关系的再生产，保证特定的经济目的。 怎么办呢？是扩大自主性、个体和集体自由的领域；还是加强安全机构并加强对社会的控制？更多的解放还是更多的秩序力量？无疑，向资产阶级国家提出积累或解放的选择是种修辞。对它来说——对于国家的形式来说——解放被视为一种仅值得控制和限制的解体元素。然而，在中间路径上存在一种调解：对自主权的每一个让步，都对应着权力螺丝的新一轮拧紧。必要时，这些让步会再次被吞噬，某种程度上通过税收再次收回主观权利，并让人们明白，法治国家随时有权将暴力垄断转化为日常结构的决定，其中只有公民才能享受自己的存在。那么，是“国家中的一切，国家之外的无”，如墨索里尼所说吗？但是历史的回忆可能会误导人，即使在联邦共和国，政治批评的处境始终是不稳定的。当然，它似乎已经通过“绿色”的成功而稳定下来，即：通过一种虽然不完全是激进的异议，但至少是一种模糊不安的机构化存在。 然而，悬而未决的是鲜为人知的基本法第18条的威胁，该条可能会将激进的反对派置于精心保护的宪法框架之外。对我来说，特别值得注意的是，正是第18条在政治讨论中很少被考虑，即使是在科学分析中也是如此。它规定了“宪法的敌人”的基本权利的丧失，并通过宪法规范规定了放弃基本法序言中声明为不可剥夺的权利的可能性。本质上，第18条证明了宪法框架内权力对保障的支配。它是权力在现实中存在的法治国家中，所强调的权利最终被视为让步因此是可撤销的，的规范证明。我还要补充说明，国家作为社会的组织者虽然导致了对主观权利的这种限制；但这种限制与主观权利希望自由的本质一致，如果个人自愿服从。 再次强调：我所讨论的不是理论构造，而是作为范例的德国实际状况。这种情况在政府更迭或绿党转向更坚决的反对立场时都不太可能改变。在我们的问题背景下，问题本质上是另一个。如果公民权利被置于已建立权力的服务中，并为机构的程序正确性功能化，其防御（法律保障）与已构建国家的防御合二为一。它们成为国家保护的一个元素。我将再次讨论这一点。首先，我们注意到，这里国家确实呈现为权利的保障者：它确实保障了自己，当然不是作为一个极权实体，不是作为黑格尔式的客观化理念或斯宾诺莎式的实质。而是作为其技术、社会经济和规范形式确立的物质结构的保障者。 物质方面本身不需要进一步讨论。也不打算深入探讨指向“资本的国家”的方向。但准确地说，不是所有“公民”对政治和权力滥用、市场困境和经济政治骗局的攻击和批评都被视为直接威胁国家，只有那些公然、毫不掩饰地反对资本和国家的批评、攻击和抗议形式才是如此。并非偶然，职业禁止被官方称为针对两种极端主义（右翼和左翼），实际上主要针对的是左翼。这是有充分理由的，遵循一条与资本逻辑无缝对接的政治逻辑。因为实际上，右翼，尤其是公开的法西斯主义（顺便说一下，利普塞特社会学上将其称为“中间的极端主义”）无疑是在攻击政治和制度游戏的某些规则，即著名的“民主游戏规则”。它试图进行彻底的更换，意图在政治阶层内部进行彻底更换，取代之前的统治者。并且，“制造”了它的制度革命，就像其他人“制造”改革一样。 尽管政治形式发生了极端变化（并且在历史上的法西斯主义中，尽管转向恐怖主义措施），右翼还是保持了生产方式不变，甚至通过全面的社会和平——即通过消除破坏性冲突——来进一步保障它。右翼不仅不打扰资产阶级社会的“整合形式”。它还加强了这种形式。没有一种法西斯主义设定了结束一般交换关系的目标，并引入生产目的的根本性转变，更不用说结束统治结构了。因此，它不想知道国家的废除，甚至否认社会过程的客观强制性质的立即或渐进性克服的可能性。"},{"prompt":"gerçek, zihni özgürleştiren en güçlü ilaçtır. horace. bu sözün Latince orijinali nedir, hangi kitapta geçer?","completion":"Horace'ın \\"gerçek, zihni özgürleştiren en güçlü ilaçtır\\" şeklinde ifade edilen sözü Latince orijinal olarak \\"veritas liberabit vos\\" şeklinde bilinir.

One effective way to work with such large datasets is to read the data in chunks and use batch processing. Below, I'll guide you through the process of handling a large dataset like yours and training a model efficiently. 1. **Reading the Data in Chunks**: You can use \`pandas\` to read the data in smaller chunks, then process each chunk individually. This helps in minimizing memory usage. 2. **Preprocessing**: Before training, decide how you will preprocess your data (e.g., normalization, categorical encoding). This should be consistent across all chunks of data. 3. **Model Training with Batches**: Utilize a framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that supports batch training. This will allow you to efficiently feed your data into the neural network in manageable sizes. Here's a step-by-step example using \`pandas\` for chunk processing and TensorFlow for model training: # Step 1: Install Required Libraries Make sure you have TensorFlow installed. If not, install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install tensorflow \`\`\` # Step 2: Define a Data Generator We'll create a Python generator that yields data in batches suitable for training. This assumes you've already preprocessed your dataset or will do so on-the-fly. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from tensorflow.keras.utils import Sequence # Adjust these paths and parameters according to your dataset and system dataset_path = r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\" chunk_size = 10000 # This depends on your available memory batch_size = 32 # Adjust based on your model's needs # Assuming a binary classification problem target_column = 'target' # Specify the name of your target variable def preprocess_features(chunk): # Example preprocessing: just select numerical features and fill NA values features = chunk.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).fillna(0) # Example: Normalize features here if needed return features def data_generator(): reader = pd.read_csv(dataset_path, chunksize=chunk_size) for chunk in reader: # Preprocess the chunk: Feature selection, scaling, etc. features = preprocess_features(chunk) labels = chunk[target_column].values # Further processing, like normalization, can be done here # Yield batches for i in range(0, len(features), batch_size): X_batch = features.iloc[i:i+batch_size] y_batch = labels[i:i+batch_size] yield np.array(X_batch), np.array(y_batch) # Note: Depending on your task, you might need to split your data into training/validation/test sets # and adjust the generator to handle each subset. \`\`\` # Step 3: Define and Compile Your Model Assuming a simple model for demonstration. Adjust the model according to your specific problem. \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense def build_model(input_shape): model = Sequential([ Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape), Dense(32, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # Assuming binary classification ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) return model \`\`\` # Step 4: Train the Model Before fitting the model, ensure your generator (from Step 2) correctly outputs the batches. \`\`\`python # Example: Assuming we know the input shape beforehand input_shape = (10,) # Example input shape, adjust based on your actual data features model = build_model(input_shape) # Since we are using a generator, we can use the \`fit_generator\` method # Note: In recent versions of TensorFlow, you can simply use \`fit\` # Example: model.fit(data_generator(), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10) # Adjust steps_per_epoch based on how you partition your data \`\`\` # Important Notes: - **Preprocessing and Data Handling**: This example performs very basic preprocessing. You'll need to adjust data handling and preprocessing based on your specific dataset and task (e.g., handling categorical variables, text data, etc.). - **Dataset Splitting**: Ideally, you should split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. The generator or your data loading strategy should accommodate this. - **Model Architecture**: The provided model architecture is a simple example. For best results, customize the architecture according to your problem. You might also consider using advanced techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or different architectures for better performance. Handling large datasets requires carefully managing memory and efficiently processing your data, so make sure to monitor your system's resource usage throughout the process."},{"prompt":"ok i wrote and this is my full code: error: { \\"name\\": \\"KeyError\\", \\"message\\": \\"('y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d')\\", \\"stack\\": \\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------- KeyError Traceback (most recent call last) Cell In[13], line 5 1 model = build_model() 3 # history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, 4 # validation_data=(X_dev, y_dev)) ----> 5 history = model.fit(data_generator(), steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10) File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packageskerassrcutilstraceback_utils.py:122, in filter_traceback.<locals>.error_handler(*args, **kwargs) 119 filtered_tb = _process_traceback_frames(e.__traceback__) 120 # To get the full stack trace, call: 121 # \`keras.config.disable_traceback_filtering()\` --> 122 raise e.with_traceback(filtered_tb) from None 123 finally: 124 del filtered_tb Cell In[8], line 11, in data_generator() 3 for chunk in reader: 5 X = chunk.drop([ 6 'Date', 'Symbol', 7 'y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 8 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 9 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 10 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d'], axis=1).values ---> 11 Y = chunk['y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 12 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 13 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 14 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d'].values 15 xScaler = StandardScaler() 16 yScaler = StandardScaler() File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreframe.py:4102, in DataFrame.__getitem__(self, key) 4100 if self.columns.nlevels > 1: 4101 return self._getitem_multilevel(key) -> 4102 indexer = self.columns.get_loc(key) 4103 if is_integer(indexer): 4104 indexer = [indexer] File c:UsersarisaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython310libsite-packagespandascoreindexesbase.py:3812, in Index.get_loc(self, key) 3807 if isinstance(casted_key, slice) or ( 3808 isinstance(casted_key, abc.Iterable) 3809 and any(isinstance(x, slice) for x in casted_key) 3810 ): 3811 raise InvalidIndexError(key) -> 3812 raise KeyError(key) from err 3813 except TypeError: 3814 # If we have a listlike key, _check_indexing_error will raise 3815 # InvalidIndexError.

However, I can offer a review based on the snippets you've shared and common practices. Here are some considerations and potential improvements: 1. **Data Scaling**: It looks like you're attempting to scale your features (\`X\`) and targets (\`Y\`) within the data generator, which is a good practice for neural network models. Just make sure that you fit the \`StandardScaler\` (or any other scaler) on the training data only and then use it to transform both the training and validation/test sets to avoid data leakage. If your generator is meant to handle both training and validation data, ensure the scaling is done appropriately. 2. **Data Generator Yielding**: Assuming the corrected portion for selecting \`Y\`, the rest of the data generator logic seems reasonable as long as it matches the expected input and output shapes of your neural network. Ensure that each batch (\`X_batch\`, \`y_batch\`) yielded by the generator has the correct dimensions expected by your model. 3. **Model Architecture and Compilation**: Ensure that your \`build_model()\` function is correctly setting up a neural network for your specific problem. This includes choosing an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics. For instance, if you're dealing with a regression problem, your final layer should not have a \`sigmoid\` activation function and you would use a loss function such as \`mean_squared_error\`. Conversely, for a binary classification problem, your setup with \`sigmoid\` and \`binary_crossentropy\` is correct. 4. **Training Invocation**: When you call \`model.fit()\`, using \`data_generator()\`, ensure that \`steps_per_epoch\` is correctly calculated. It should ideally be the total number of samples divided by the batch size. However, since you're using a generator and may not know the exact size beforehand, your approach of specifying a fixed number works, but it might need adjustment based on the size of your dataset to ensure that the model has seen all the data. 5. **Memory Management**: Reading and processing data in chunks is a good strategy for large datasets. Just ensure that the chunk size and batch size are optimized for your system's memory to avoid out-of-memory errors. 6. **Validation Data**: If you intend to monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training, you'll need to either split your data beforehand and create a separate generator for the validation data or use the \`validation_split\` argument if your data size allows for it. Given the large size of your dataset and the chunked reading approach, the former option with a separate generator might be more applicable. Without the full view of your code, especially how you handle train/validation splits, model architecture specifics, and exact task details (regression, binary classification, multiclass classification), these points are based on common practices and assumptions. Ensure each step, especially data preprocessing and scaling, is tailored to your specific problem for optimal model performance."},{"prompt":"veritas vos liberabit. bu söz gibi \\"gerçek\\" hakkında 50 tane motto, atasözü, deyim, özdeyiş, ayet yaz.","completion":"1. \\"Gerçek er ya da geç ortaya çıkar.\\" - La Fontaine 2. \\"Gerçeğin zamanı gelmiştir, onun zamanı her zaman vardır.\\" - Victor Hugo 3. \\"Cesur insanlar gerçek karşısında eğilir.\\" - Sophokles 4. \\"Gerçekten kaçmak, yalnızca ona daha fazla yaklaşmaktır.\\" - Jiddu Krishnamurti 5. \\"Bir insanın büyüklüğü, gerçeğin hizmetindedir.\\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 6. \\"Yalnızca gerçek güzelliktir, güzellik ise yalnızca gerçekliktir.\\" - Ralph Waldo Emerson 7. \\"Gerçek, zamanın testinden geçendir.\\" - Francis Bacon 8. \\"Gerçeği söylemek, özgür bırakır.\\" - Euripides 9. \\"Gerçek bilmek isteyen, her zaman cesur olmalı.\\" - Thomas Carlyle 10. \\"Her gerçek iki yanlıdır; bilmek zorundasın ona ne zaman doğru, ne zaman yanlış bakacağını.\\" - Hazrat Inayat Khan 11. \\"Gerçek, hiçbir zaman zarar vermez; yanlış olan bizim ona nasıl yaklaştığımızdır.\\" - Mahatma Gandhi 12. \\"Gerçeği ara, ama mutluluğu orada bulamazsan, geri dön.\\" - Elbert Hubbard 13. \\"Gerçek ne kadar acı olursa olsun, yalandan daha iyidir.\\" - Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 14. \\"Gerçeğin sesi, sessizlik içinde en güçlüdür.\\" - T.S.

Uns interessiert hier die Fassung des Problems, die der Form Staat eigen ist. In der behandelten Perspektive, während die Verdinglichung als allgemeine Qualität durchschlägt und sich die Produktionsweise samt ihren Erfordernissen hinter den Institutionen versteckt, gewinnt die Verteidigung des Staats durchgängige Priorität. Die Bürgerrechte verwandeln sich (um es mit Parson oderLuhmann zu sagen) in systemische Funktionen der Stabilität. Eine beispielhafte konstitutionelle Übersetzung dieses Sachverhalts finden wir im Grundgesetz, das im vollen Umfang (also nur zur Hälfte, nämlich in den Grenzen entsprechender Gesetze)19 das Koalitionsrecht „zur Wahrung und Förderung der Arbeits¬und Wirtschaftsbeziehungen” (Art. 9 GG) anerkennt. Obwohl diese Norm nun in der Konsequenz auch den gewerkschaftlichen Arbeitskampf zuläßt, wird das Streiken nicht als Verfassungsrecht sanktioniert - anders übrigens als in anderen vergleichbaren Staaten. Der Streik wird vielmehr (so in den Urteilen des Bundesarbeitsgerichts) als ultima ratio betrachtet, die schon am äußersten Rand der Legalität angesiedelt ist. Damit stellt jeder spontane, von den vorgegebenen Ritualien abweichende Streik einen beinahe kriminellen Akt dar, der rechtlich verfolgt werden kann - zumindest eine Übertretung mit zivilrechtlichen Folgen.20 Im Zuge der Funktionalisierung vollzieht sich eine weitere Transformation. Das subjektive „Bürgerrecht”, Emblem des freien politischen Wollens des Einzelnen im Staat und gegebenenfalls gegen ihn, wird zu einer Funktion des Staats: zur Pflicht des Bürgers, sich selbst in der Verfassung wiederzuerkennen und sie zu verteidigen. Die Verteidigung des Staats, so wie er existiert - also um Mißverständnisse zu vermeiden: als verfassungsmäßige Ordnung, und nicht als totalitäres Gebilde - übersteigt die bloß moralische Dimension und wird zur „Gewißheit des Gesetzes”. In der Bundesrepublik verwandelt sie sich für den öffentlichen Dienst sogar in die präzise Pflicht, die Verfassung „auch außerhalb der Berufsausübung” zu schützen. So verfügte es ein Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zur Begründung der Legitimität des Radikalenerlasses. Im Zusammenprall von Verteidigung des Rechtsstaats und Wahrung des eigenen Handelns verkehren sich die Begriffe. Dies läßt sich in jenem, die Wirklichkeit allerdings zuweilen trübenden Spiegel der gesellschaftlichen Produktionsverhältnisse erkennen, den die Verfassungsentwicklung darstellt. Ich beziehe mich hier auf eine der bedeutendsten Änderungen des Grundgesetzes, die 1968 mit dem Einbau der Notstandsgesetze verabschiedet wurde - einem wahren Meisterstück der Politik, das auch dem bekannten Dreggerschen Vorgehen den ideologischen Boden bereitete. Die Verabschiedung der Notstandsgesetze wurde durch die Zustimmung der sozialdemokratischen Opposition zu den Entwürfen Adenauers ermöglicht. Der Zustimmung der SPD gingen langwierige Verhandlungen voraus, die auch unter dem Druck der außerparlamentarischen Opposition standen. Sie erfolgte schließlich durch die Übernahme eines sozialdemokratischen Vorschlags, zusammen mit dem Notstandsrecht auch ein Widerstandsrecht konstitutionell zu verankern. Wahrlich ein historischer Kompromiß: die Sozialdemokraten stimmten also den Notstandsgesetzen zu nur bei gleichzeitiger Bestätigung des Rechts, Widerstand zu leisten. Aber: wogegen denn? Der Kompromiß erwies sich einzig als hoffnungslose Kompromittierung der Sozialdemokraten mit dem Machtsystem - vermutlich das Schicksal aller historischen Kompromisse. Ich will die ganze Problematik des Widerstandsrechts nicht wieder aufgreifen. Es sei nur daran erinnert, daß in der Geschichte der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft (aber auch fortgeschrieben in eine zukünftige Gesellschaft der Emanzipation) das Widerstandsrecht in der Möglichkeit gründet, sich in legitimer Weise gegen die legale Macht zur Wehr zu setzen, gegen die Anmaßungen des Staats, der Staatsorgane, der Herrschenden. Kurz gesagt: ein Recht „in tyrannos”. Es ist nicht nötig, Marat zu bemühen, und ein denkbares Grundrecht der Rebellion und Revolution zu postulieren, das immer dann in Kraft träte, wenn der Staat elementare Bedürfnisse der Bürger nicht befriedigte. Solche Vorstellungen trieben schon über die Grenzen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft hinaus, die durchaus andere Sorgen hat als die „Bedürfnisse” der Einzelnen oder der Massen. In gewis- ser Hinsicht hat Marat aber doch etwas damit zu tun. Tatsäch- lich bildete sich das Widerstandsrecht schon seit seinem Anfang mit antistaatlichen Merkmalen heraus. Es bedeutete die Ablehnung einer blinden Unterwerfung unter die bestehende Macht ebenso wie die Legitimität des Aufstands gegen Übermacht und Depravation der Institutionen. Um die Frage zuzuspitzen: im Fall einer Nichterfüllung klar bestimmter Aufgaben, wenn der Staat historisch nicht in der Lage oder nicht gewillt ist, beispielsweise seinen Rechtsgarantien nachzukom- men; wenn die politische Klasse sich in Geplauder über Moral, Anstand und Gerechtigkeit ergeht, ohne konkret zu handeln, hat der Bürger Möglichkeit und Recht, sich das Monopol auf den Gebrauch von Macht und Gewalt wieder anzueignen und -um argumentativ in den Grenzen der bürgerlichen Ideologie zu bleiben - die vertraglichen Ursprungsbedingungen der Staatlichkeit wieder herzustellen21. Genauer, konkreter und stärker klassenbezogen verstanden, tritt dabei die Macht des Volkes wieder in Kraft, die nur widerruflich an die staatliche Politik delegiert worden war und nunmehr zu ihrem materiellen Sub- jekt zurückkehrt, wenn sich die Politik gegen den Mandante tellt. Hier ist die (linke Gretchenfrage zweitrangig, ob es sich um ideale oder idealistische oder materialistische Vorstellungen handelt; wenngleich ihre materialistische Basis recht deutlich zu sein scheint. Ich beschränke mich auf die Feststellung, daß die ursprüngliche Beziehung zwischen „Volk” und „Staat”, zwischen Citoyen und Macht durch die Normierung des Widerstandsrechts im Grundgesetz buchstäblich umgekehrt wird. Gewährt wird in der Tat dem einzelnen Bürger oder sozialen Gruppen das Recht, auch gewaltsamen Widerstand zu leisten, weder gegen Mißbräuche der Staatsordnung noch gegen Nichterfüllung ihrer Aufgaben, sondern „gegen jeden, der es unter- nimmt, diese Ordnung zu beseitigen ..., wenn andere Abhilfe nicht möglich ist” (das heißt in Abwesenheit gleichwie gearteter legaler Ordnungsorgane). Ein Einwand wird gewiß kommen: das traditionelle Widerstandsrecht richte sich eben in tyrannos, hätte also mit der besonderen Situation frei gewählter Regierungen und durch allgemeine Zustimmung abgesegneter Staatsformen nichts zu tun. Indessen: die von den Monarchomachen der Ausgrenzung und der Ermordung freigegebenen Könige galten nur ihren Widersachern als Tyrannen. In der normativen Wirklichkeit, in der Objektivität der damaligen Ordnung herrschten sie in aller Form und im Inhalt der religiösen Fundierung legitim. Gottes-gnadentum und allgemeine Zustimmung der Untertanen stellen keine bloß legale Begründung dar. Das macht auch den tieferen Sinn und die philosophische Dignität des Widerstands aus, sich gegen eine mit Legitimität ausgestattete und abgesicherte Macht zu richten. Gegen sie erhebt sich die subjektive Wirklichkeit des Aufstands. Kehrt man dieses Verhältnis um, so betreibt man geschicht lich, politisch und selbst rechtsgeschichtlich Unfug. Eben diesen Unfug machte der Bonner Gesetzgeber zur Verfassungsnorm. Es kommt dabei etwas Merkwürdiges hinzu. Widerstandsrecht be deutet offensichtlich die Delegation des Gewaltmonopols an die „Bürger” zu dem Zweck, den Staat, und paradoxerweise auch dessen Gewaltmonopol, zu verteidigen. Es wird also gegen alle europäische Tradition zu einer Funktion des Staatsrechts, mit einer solchen Sorglosigkeit und Unbefangenheit, daß sogar die heilige Kuh der bürgerlichen Politik geopfert wird: die aus schließliche Befugnis des Staates, Gewalt anzuwenden. Erstaun licherweise wurde in der Öffentlichkeit diese Kapitulation des Staats gar nicht wahrgenommen. Zusammenfassend: Zweck des Widerstands ist nach dem Grundgesetz die Verteidigung der ver fassungsmäßigen Staatsmacht; Objekt der zivilen Gewaltaus übung sind deren Feinde. Und nur ein Feind des Staates könnte auf den Gedanken kommen, die normative Gültigkeit dieser überaus einmaligen Lösung zu bestreiten.”翻译为中文","completion":"公民捍卫权力 为了正确引导国家，我绕过了所有强制性的要求，并假定经济与政治之间关系的问题是已知的。我们在这里关注的是国家形式固有的问题表述。在所讨论的视角中，当物化作为一种普遍性质贯穿始终，并且生产方式及其要求隐藏在制度背后时，国家的防御成为了首要优先事项。公民权利转变为（用帕森斯或卢曼的话说）系统稳定的功能。在基本法中，我们找到了这一情况的典型宪法表述，它在完整的范围内（也就是说，只有一半，即在相应法律的范围内）承认了“保护和促进劳动与经济关系”的结社权（第9条）。尽管这一规定现在也允许工会进行劳动斗争，但罢工并没有作为宪法权利受到制裁 - 与其他类似国家不同。相反，罢工（如联邦劳动法院的判决所示）被视为极限手段，位置已经位于合法性的最边缘。因此，任何偏离既定程序的自发罢工都被视为几乎是犯罪行为，可以被法律追究 - 至少是带有民事后果的违法行为。 随着功能化的进行，发生了进一步的转变。主观的“公民权”，作为个人在国家中的自由政治意志的象征，有时甚至是针对国家的，变成了国家的一个功能：公民的责任，是在宪法中重新认识自己并且捍卫它。对现存的国家的防御 - 为了避免误解：作为宪法秩序而非极权结构 - 超越了单纯的道德维度，变成了“法律的确定性”。在德意志联邦共和国，它甚至转变为公共服务的具体责任，即“在职业活动之外”也保护宪法。这是根据联邦宪法法院的判决来证明对激进分子令的合法性所采取的措施。 在捍卫法治国家与维护自己行动的碰撞中，概念发生了逆转。这可以在宪法发展呈现出的、有时会使现实模糊不清的社会生产关系的镜子中看到。我在这里指的是基本法最重大的修改之一，即1968年加入紧急状态法的通过 - 这是政治的真正杰作，也为著名的德雷格尔行为提供了意识形态基础。紧急状态法的通过是在接受社会民主党反对派对阿登纳草案的支持下实现的。社会民主党的同意是在外部反对派的压力下经过漫长谈判最终达成的。它最终是通过采纳一个社会民主党的提议实现的，即在紧急权力的同时，也将抵抗权宪法化。这真是一个历史性的妥协：社会民主党因此支持紧急状态法，只有在同时确认抵抗权的条件下。但是：抗议什么呢？这一妥协唯一表现为社会民主党与权力体系的绝望妥协 - 这可能是所有历史妥协的命运。 我不想重新讨论抵抗权的全部问题。只需提醒一下，在市民社会的历史中（但也写入未来的解放社会中），抵抗权基于合法地抵抗合法权力的可能性，抵抗国家、国家机构、统治者的专横。简而言之：一项“反抗暴君”的权利。没有必要援引马拉，并假设一种基本权利的叛乱和革命，每当国家不满足公民的基本需求时就生效。这样的想法已经超越了市民社会的界限，市民社会关心的是除了“需求”之外的其他忧虑。某种意义上，马拉确实与此事有关。实际上，抵抗权从一开始就具有反国家的特征。它意味着拒绝盲目地服从现有权力，以及反对机构的暴政和堕落的合法性。为了使问题更加尖锐：在无法完成明确任务的情况下，如果国家历史上无法或不愿例如履行其法律担保；当政治阶层只是在道德、礼仪和正义方面空谈而不采取具体行动时，公民有权利和权力重新夺回对权力和暴力的使用，并且 - 为了在市民意识形态的界限内进行论证 - 恢复国家性的合同原始条件。更准确、更具体、更加阶级意识的理解是，人民的权力重新生效，该权力只是被临时委托给国家政策，现在返回其物质主体，如果政策背离了委托人。在这里，（左翼的格雷琴问题是次要的，无论是理想的还是唯心主义的或是唯物主义的概念；尽管它们的唯物主义基础似乎相当明显。我限于指出，在“人民”与“国家”、“公民”与权力之间的原始关系，通过在基本法中规范化抵抗权，被字面上颠倒了。实际上，它确实授予了个别公民或社会团体权利，即在其他救济措施不可能的情况下，也可以进行暴力抵抗，不是针对国家秩序的滥用或其任务的不履行，而是“针对任何企图消除这一秩序的人……，如果没有其他救济措施”（即在缺乏任何合法秩序机构的情况下）。 一个反驳肯定会来：传统的抵抗权是针对暴君的，因此与自由选举的政府和通过普遍同意确认的国家形式的特殊情况无关。然而：被排除和刺杀的君主只对他们的对手来说是暴君。在当时的规范现实中，他们在所有形式和宗教基础的内容中完全合法地统治。神授权和臣民的普遍认可不仅仅构成法律上的理由。这也构成了抵抗的更深层含义和哲学尊严，即反对具有合法性和保障的权力。对抗它的是起义的主观现实。 如果颠倒这种关系，那么在历史上、政治上甚至是法律历史上都是胡说八道。正是这种胡说八道被波恩立法机构制定为宪法准则。与此同时，还有一点奇怪的现象。显然，抵抗权意味着向“公民”授权使用暴力的垄断，以保卫国家，也就是说，保卫其暴力垄断。这与所有欧洲传统背道而驰，成为国家法的一个功能，处理得如此轻率和随意，以至于甚至牺牲了市民政治的圣牛：国家行使暴力的专有权。令人惊奇的是，这种状态的投降在公众中几乎没有被注意到。总结：根据基本法，抵抗的目的是捍卫宪法规定的国家权力；文明使用暴力的对象是其敌人。而只有国家的敌人才会反对这个极其特殊解决方案的规范有效性。"},{"prompt":"请将“Der Vorrang des Rechts und die Vormacht des Staats Die Gewaltanwendung von freien Bürgern gegen andere mit einer rechtlichen Absegnung auszustatten ist keine Kleinigkeit. Daraus einen Verfassungsartikel zu machen22 bedeutet, ihrer Vorbereitung und Ausführung die Qualität eines allgemeinen Gesetzes zu verleihen. Die Verteidigung des Staats wird nicht anbefohlen. Sie ist geboten. Ihr liegt also keine bloße Verordnung, aber auch keine zwingende Verfügung zugrunde: keine Maßnahme, die die Gewaltanwendung freigäbe. Carl Schmitt und der Faschismus bleiben gänzlich außen vor; die Verfassungsänderung schafft es: der Staat bleibt Gesetzesstaat23 und das Recht behauptet seinen Vorrang. Nicht Zerrüttung ist also die Folge der Reduzierung garantierter Freiheiten, sondern das Gegenteil: die sich voll durchsetzende Ordnung und das gesicherte Wertesystem. Eines ist aber klar: der Bürger, der sich als Freier verflüchtigt und in einen Polizisten verwandelt; der klassische Schutzwall gegen die Herrschaft in sein Gegenteil verkehrt - all dies entstammt nicht der Unbekümmertheit der Wirklichkeit gegenüber der Norm, deren Geringschätzung seitens der Macht. Dagegen steht das Recht als Macht, als Herr der Gesellschaft. Freilich kommt es darauf an, was sich in ihm selbst - keineswegs hinter seinem Rücken - abspielt. Sein Vorrang kommt nicht von ungefähr, ist genausowenig wie Vicos Heroen „coelo demissus\\". Er fügt sich vielmehr in die anscheinend unumgängliche, nüchterne und irdische Tendenz unserer heutigen Gesellschaft, den Bereich der juristisch geregelten Materie auszuweiten. Also die Tendenz zur Verrechtlichung. Hatte Marx erkannt, daß in bürgerlichen Gesellschaften alle Zustände und Vorgänge „eine politische Form annehmen\\", so können wir dies heute präzisieren: alles wird in rechtliche Regelung überführt. Selbstredend auch die Politik. Daher der häufige Kurzschluß, in der Ausweitung der juristischen Materie eine Stärkung des Rechtsstaats zu sehen. Es findet also sowohl eine Verringerung, eine Einkreisung rechtsfreier Räume für die Bürger statt, wie auch eine Einkreisung der Handlungsspielräume der Staatsmacht. Gäbe es kein Stück Dasein mehr, das sich der Normierung durch ein übergeordnetes Prinzip entzieht, gäbe nur heteronome Zonen, verlöre auch der Staat seine Autonomie. Und in der Tat heißt es im Grundgesetz, der Gesetzgeber sei an Recht und Gesetz gebun den. Anders gesagt: das Recht erhält die sonst dem Staat zugeschriebene totalisierende Macht und überträgt - gewissermaßen als Gegenleistung - dem Staat seine „aristotelische\\" Eigenschaft, unparteiisch und desinteressiert zu sein. Der Rechtsstaat ist kein Klassenstaat, weil der Herr der Gesellschaft keine Klassenschranken kennt. Ob das Recht sich auch als Herr über die Ökonomie behauptet, ist marxistisch gesehen ohne Zweifel die wesentliche Frage. Aber sie gehört nicht hierher. Nur trügt der Schein der Desinteressiertheit. Er trügt auch uns oft über die wirkliche Bedeutung und die strategische Reichweite des Phänomens. Die legale Ordnung gibt der Macht die formbestimmte Richtung, richtet sich aber nicht gegen sie. Von ihr verlangt sie nur den legitimatorischen Kernpunkt der proze-duralen Korrektheit. Der Vorrang des Rechts gilt der Gesellschaft: sie wird in Zucht genommen, nicht der Staat. Solche Überlegungen gehen offensichtlich über die Thematik berechtigter subjektiver Ansprüche hinaus und betreffen auch nicht die Probleme des Ausnahmezustands. Der Zusammenprall von gesellschaftlicher Autonomie und Form Staat findet im Normalzustand statt und tangiert die objektive Seite der Reproduktion. Ich will es kurz erläutern. Was ich (mit einem nicht sonderlich eleganten Begriff) Verrechtlichung nenne, stellt eine komplexe strategische Operation dar, die über die rein juristische Welt hinausgeht und auf herkömmlich-gängige Weise nicht gefaßt werden kann. Sie versucht, das gesellschaftliche Gewebe wieder zusammenzunähen, das durch Interessenkonflikte, Klassenauseinandersetzungen und durch die negative, teilweise destruktive Handlungsweise neuer sozialer Subjekte zerrissen und überdies von ökonomischen Krisen zersetzt wird. Daß dieser Versuch nicht durch willkürliche Aktionen vorangebracht wird, sondern in institutionell abgesicherter Weise erfolgt, vermindert allerdings seinen Zwangscharakter nicht. Das muß betont werden, weil man angelegentlich und gerne den Zwangscharakter mit offener oder versteckter Despotie zu verbinden und derart die Normalität eines bürgerlichen Staats davon freizusprechen pflegt.24 Im Gegenteil: Zustände und Vorgänge gründen sich auf Zwang, auch wenn dieser die Form der allgemeingültigen und allgemein akzeptierten Disziplinierung annimmt. Darin liegt gerade der Triumph des Rechts, dem Zwang den Anschein der Unterdrückung zu nehmen. Das Erfordernis der Verrechtlichung kennt nun wieder keine nationalen Grenzen. Was in Deutschland schon längst vollzogen ist, meldet sich auch in Italien an. Nicht, daß Form und Formel sich bereits hinlänglich durchgesetzt hätten. Aber im Zusammenhang mit Streikregulierung und Marktderegulierung, mit Neufassung des Parteiensystems und Umpolung der gewerkschaftlichen Aufgaben, mit fiskalischer Umverteilung und Neuordnung der sozialen Ausgaben wächst die Versuchung, den gesellschaftlichen Antagonismus und die Konfliktualität gesetzlich zu steuern. Nicht ohne Lärm kündigt sich eine „große Wende” zum modernen Staat hin an: die Wandlung eines nicht ganz in den Fugen gebliebenen bürgerlichen Staats in einen legalen, legalisierenden, fugengerechten. Es ist eine Versuchung oder ein Projekt, vielleicht ein Traum - oder vermutlich der Ausdruck eines politischen Machtbedürfnisses zur ideologischen Überfahrt von Locke zu Luhmann25, nicht ohne zuerst den Weber-schen, sodann folgerichtigerweise den Schmittschen Engpaß zu durchqueren. Schwierig dürfte sich die Überfahrt nicht gestalten. Was in Italien das Kapital in ökonomischer Absicht braucht, wünschen sich die Leute in alltäglicher Absicht: einen Staat, der endlich seinen Namen verdient, endlich effizient ist, mit wirksamer Führung und geklärter Machtverteilung, weniger gebeutelt durch Regierungskrisen und dunkle Obstruktionen - einen Staat ohne Lächerlichkeit; einen Staat jedenfalls, der nach soviel Mühen endlich eine modern¬kapitalistische, fortschrittliche Häutung erfährt. Nur möchten die Leute einen Garanten der sozialen Rechte, des ruhigen mehr denn des geordneten Zusammenlebens, und einer bedürfnisgerechten Verteilung; das Kapital hingegen fordert die staatliche Absicherung der Akkumulation, des freien Markts, der freien Verfügungsgewalt, nebenher auch der gewerkschaftlich nicht gestörten Freiheit des Arbeitsvertrags - alles im Zeichen des vorrangigen Rechts. Ich kehre zur deutschen Erfahrung und zu unserem Problem zurück. Die ausgeweitete Herrschaft des Rechts führt, oder soll führen, auch zur Lückenlosigkeit der sozialen Kontrolle. Sprichwörtlich heißt es: „Nichts entgeht dem Auge des Gesetzes” - in der eindeutigen Zweideutigkeit des Wortes, das mit dem Auge die Rechtsordnung, aber auch die gerichtliche Verfügung; die lückenlose Normativität, aber auch den höchstalltäglichen Blick eines Polizisten meint.26 Daß übrigens das Auge des Gesetzes wie die Augen des Gerichts in Fragen möglicher Dissidenz nach links schielen, ist bekannt und wird auch stets kritisch betont, bleibt aber sekundär. In der angestrebten oder behaupteten Identität von Rechtsstaat und realem Staat ist die Frage wichtiger, ob sich aus dem Vorrang des Rechts wirklich eine Unterordnung der Staatsmacht ergibt. Wer ist also der wahre Kaiser? Entweder sind Rechtsstaat und Vorrang des Rechts lediglich Herrschaftsformeln, die Forderung nach erweiterter juristischer Regelung und nach allgemeingültiger Bindung nur ideologische Vorwände, und dann bliebe dem leibhaftigen Kaiser seine volle Macht. Oder wir nehmen die Rechtsordnung ernst, erkennen ihre Machtvollkommenheit in der und für die Gesellschaft, dann müßte das Recht selbst der Kaiser sein und bräuchte keine Rücksicht auf andere Instanzen zu nehmen. Ihm wäre ein Jeder und Alles unterworfen.”翻译为中文","completion":"法律优先与国家权力 将自由公民对其他公民使用暴力的行为通过法律认可，绝非小事。将之制成宪法条款意味着给予其筹备和执行过程一种普遍法律的质量。国家的保卫不是被建议的，而是被命令的。因此，它既不基于单纯的指令，也不基于强制性的规定：没有任何授权使用暴力的措施。卡尔·施密特和法西斯主义完全被排除在外；宪法修正案做到了：国家仍然是法治国家，法律维持其优先地位。因此，减少保障的自由并非导致瓦解，而恰恰相反：是完全贯彻的秩序和确保的价值体系。 但有一点是明确的：那些隐退并转变为警察的自由公民；将抵御统治的防线转变为反面的事实——这些都不源于对规范现实的无视或权力对规范的轻视。相反，法律作为权力，作为社会的主宰存在。当然，关键是在法律内部——绝非在其背后——发生的事情。其优先地位并非无缘无故，也绝不像维科的英雄那样“天降”。它更是融入我们当今社会看似不可避免、清醒和世俗的趋势中，那就是扩大法律调整领域的范围。即法律化的趋势。马克思曾认识到，在资产阶级社会中，所有状态和过程“都采取政治形式”，今天我们可以准确地说明：一切都转化为法律规则。包括政治在内。因此常常误认为，扩大法律规范领域是法治国家的加强。 因此，既有对公民无法律约束空间的减少和限制，也有对国家权力行使空间的限制。如果再没有生存的领域能逃避高于一切的原则的规范化，只存在异质的区域，国家也将失去其自主性。事实上，基本法规定，立法者受到法律的约束。 换句话说：法律获得了通常归于国家的全面权力，并且作为回报——某种程度上——将其“亚里士多德式”的特性，即公正无私，转让给国家。法治国家不是阶级国家，因为社会的主宰不认识阶级界限。无论法律是否能够主宰经济，从马克思主义的角度看，这无疑是一个关键问题。但这不在我们的讨论范围内。 只是无兴趣的假象是虚假的。它也经常使我们对现象的真正意义和战略范围误解。合法秩序给予权力以明确的方向，但并不反对权力。法律只要求其提供程序正确性的合法性核心。法律的优先适用于社会：是对社会进行约束，而非对国家。 这样的考虑显然超出了合法主观权利的主题，并且不涉及紧急状态的问题。社会自主性与国家形式的冲突发生在常态下，并触及再生产的客观方面。 我将简要阐释。我所说的“法律化”（用一个不太优雅的术语）是一种复杂的战略操作，它超出了纯法律领域的界限，以传统的方式无法捕捉。它试图重新缝合因利益冲突、阶级斗争以及新社会主体的负面、部分破坏性行为和经济危机瓦解而撕裂的社会组织。这种尝试并非通过任意行为推进，而是以制度化的方式进行，但这并不减少其强制性。这需要强调，因为人们倾向于将强制性与公然或隐秘的专制联系起来，并试图将资本主义国家的常态与此区分开。相反：状态和过程基于强制，即使这种强制采取了普遍有效和普遍接受的纪律形式。其中正是法律的胜利之处，即去除了强制的压迫性外观。 法律化的需求不认识国界。在德国早已实现的，在意大利也在显现。不是说形式和公式已经充分实施。但在与罢工规则和市场放松管制、政党系统的重新构造和工会任务的重新定位、财政再分配和社会支出的重新排序相关联的背景下，通过法律调控社会对立和冲突的诱惑正在增长。不无动静地宣告着向现代国家的“大转变”：从一个不完整的资产阶级国家，转变为一个合法的、法律化的、合缝的国家。这是一种诱惑或计划，或许是一个梦想——或可能是政治权力需求向洛克至卢曼的意识形态过渡的表达，而不是在越过韦伯、然后自然而然地穿过施密特的瓶颈之前。这次旅程不应难以完成。在意大利，资本以经济意图需要什么，人们在日常生活中也有所期待：一个终于名副其实的国家，终于高效，具有有效的领导和明确的权力分配，不再被政府危机和阴暗的阻碍所困扰——一个没有荒谬性的国家；在经历了如此多困难之后，终于实现了现代资本主义、进步的转变的国家。只是人们想要的是社会权利的保障者，宁静甚至有序共处的保护者，以及需求适当分配的守护者；而资本则要求国家保障积累、自由市场、自由支配权的安全，还有劳动合同的不受工会干扰的自由——一切都在法律优先的标志下进行。 我回到德国的经验和我们的问题上来。法律的扩大统治导致或应导致社会控制的无缝。俗话说：“法律的眼睛无所不见”——在这个词的明确的双关性中，既指法律秩序，也指法庭裁决；指无缝的规范性，也指警察最日常的目光。 顺便提一下，众所周知，法律的眼睛和法庭的眼睛在可能的异议问题上往往向左倾斜，这一点也经常受到批评强调，但这是次要的。在追求或声称的法治国家与实际国家的身份问题中，重要的是是否由于法律的优先真的导致了国家权力的从属。那么，真正的皇帝是谁呢？要么法治国家和法律优先只不过是统治的口号，对扩大法律规定和普遍约束的要求只是意识形态的借口，那么真正的皇帝保留其全部权力。或者我们认真对待法律秩序，认识到其在社会中和为了社会的权力完备性，那么法律本身就应是皇帝，不需要考虑其他因素。人人和一切都应服从它。"},{"prompt":"my code: #

Specifically, the model expects inputs of shape \`(None, 72, 6427)\`, but it's receiving inputs of shape \`(None, 6427)\`. This mismatch arises because your model is configured to expect 3-dimensional input data due to this line: \`\`\`python input_shape = (72, 6427) \`\`\` However, your \`data_generator\` is yielding batches of data with shape \`(batch_size, 6427)\` instead of \`(batch_size, 72, 6427)\`. To fix this issue, you have to make sure that the shape of the input data matches the model's expected input shape. There are a couple of ways to approach solving this problem: 1. **Adjust the data shape to match the model's expectations**: This would mean modifying your data generator to yield data with an additional dimension that matches the model's expected input shape. However, adding an artificial dimension doesn't seem appropriate unless you have a specific reason to model the data in such a format (like sequences or time steps which aren't evident in your current setup). 2. **Adjust the model to match your data's shape**: It's likely more appropriate to change the model's expected input shape to match the data you're actually working with. If your data instances are indeed meant to be vectors of length 6427 (and not sequences of 72 steps), modify your model's input shape accordingly: Change this line: \`\`\`python input_shape = (72, 6427) \`\`\` To: \`\`\`python input_shape = (6427,) \`\`\` Given the structure of your model and the way you've designed your \`data_generator\`, the second approach makes more sense. You're dealing with high-dimensional input data, not sequential data that would necessitate the original \`(72, 6427)\` shape. Furthermore, there seem to be problematic usages of layers directly without calling them on an input in the model definition. Each layer (except the input layer) must be called with the previous layer as its input, like so: \`\`\`python x = Dense(6427, activation='relu')(inputs) x = Dropout(0.25)(x) # Note: Now correctly passing x through Dropout \`\`\` These errors need to be fixed for all layers in your model where you've just declared layers without actually using the functional API correctly by not providing the previous layer's output as the input to the next layer.

Here are some potential resolutions to address this issue: # Ensure Eager Execution is Enabled First, ensure TensorFlow is running in Eager execution mode, which is the default mode from TensorFlow 2.x onwards. You can check and enable Eager execution explicitly as follows: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf if not tf.executing_eagerly(): tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() \`\`\` # Verify Your Data Generator Given that this error surfaced while using the \`.fit()\` method with a generator (\`data_generator()\`), it's crucial to confirm that your generator yields the data in the correct format. Specifically, the generator should yield two items per iteration: one for the inputs (features) and one for the outputs (labels/targets). Each item should be a tuple or a list where the first element corresponds to the input data batch, and the second to the corresponding target data batch. Ensure your \`yield\` line in \`data_generator\` looks similar to this: \`\`\`python yield np.array(X_batch), np.array(y_batch) \`\`\` Considering you were encountering shape-related issues earlier, ensure that when you manipulate shapes to address the previous issues, the yielded batches from the generator match the model's input and output expectations. # Decorate Functions with @tf.function While not directly related to the error message, if there are custom functions or parts of your code where you manipulate TensorFlow operations, consider using the \`@tf.function\` decorator to convert Python functions into TensorFlow graph-compatible functions. This is more relevant for custom training loops or if you've modified the data handling in a way that integrates TensorFlow operations directly. # Inspect Model's Expected Input and Output Shapes Ensure your model's input and output layers are correctly specified for the shapes of the data being passed. You can inspect the model's expected input and output shapes with: \`\`\`python model.summary() \`\`\` Make sure the shapes in your \`data_generator\` match these expectations, particularly after addressing the initial shape mismatch issue. # Conclusion Given the information, resolving the shape mismatch in your data generator and ensuring the generator yields data in the correct format are the most likely solutions to your problem. Double-checking the eager execution mode and inspecting the model summary can also provide insights into potential discrepancies in expected data formats."},{"prompt":"уравнение нормали к функции y=2(x^2)+3 в точке x=-1","completion":"Чтобы найти уравнение нормали к функции (y=2(x^2)+3) в точке (x = -1), сначала найдем производную данной функции, которая покажет нам угловой коэффициент касательной в любой точке. Производная (y) по (x): [y' = d(2x^2 + 3)/dx = 4x.] Теперь подставим (x = -1) в производную, чтобы найти угловой коэффициент касательной в этой точке: [y'(-1) = 4(-1) = -4.] Касательная и нормаль в любой точке кривой взаимно перпендикулярны, следовательно, их угловые коэффициенты (m_1) и (m_2) удовлетворяют условию (m_1 cdot m_2 = -1). Так как угловой коэффициент касательной (m_1 = -4), то для нормали он будет: [m_2 = -frac{1}{m_1} = -frac{1}{-4} = frac{1}{4}.] Теперь, зная угловой коэффициент нормали и точку, через которую она проходит ((x = -1), подставим в исходную функцию (y = 2(-1)^2 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5), т.е. точка ((-1, 5))), мы можем написать уравнение нормали. Используем точечно-угловую форму уравнения прямой: [y - y_1 = m(x - x_1),] где (m) – угловой коэффициент, а ((x_1, y_1)) – координаты данной точки. Подставляя значения (m = frac{1}{4}), (x_1 = -1), и (y_1 = 5), получаем: [y - 5 = frac{1}{4}(x + 1).] Это и есть искомое уравнение нормали к функции (y=2(x^2)+3) в точке (x = -1)."},{"prompt":"knapa sg terompet kya eek","completion":"Saya mohon maaf, tapi saya butuh sedikit lebih banyak konteks atau klarifikasi mengenai pertanyaan Anda.

Kecerdasan ini melibatkan kemampuan mempersepsikan, mensintesis, dan menalar informasi, seperti bagaimana yang dijelaskan oleh Nabeel (2023).

Ini memungkinkan performa besar dalam kecerdasan model bahasa, seperti yang ditunjukkan model AI bahasa seperti BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). Teknologi NLP (natural language processing) pada AI bahasa berkembang dengan dikeluarkannya berbagai dataset, seperti LogiQA (Liu et al., 2023) and Reclor (Yu et al., 2020).

Berikut ini adalah beberapa cara yang bisa membantu Anda bangun lebih cepat, terutama ketika Anda harus pergi ke sekolah: 1. **Pergi tidur lebih awal.** Usahakan untuk mematikan semua perangkat elektronik setidaknya satu jam sebelum waktu tidur dan coba untuk pergi tidur lebih awal sehingga Anda dapat mendapatkan cukup istirahat. 2. **Atur jam alarm.** Atur jam alarm di smartphone atau jam weker Anda dan letakkan sedikit jauh dari tempat tidur, sehingga Anda harus bangun untuk mematikannya. 3. **Rutinitas malam hari.** Membuat rutinitas sebelum tidur bisa membantu tubuh Anda menyiapkan diri untuk waktu istirahat, seperti membaca buku atau mendengarkan musik yang tenang. 4. **Hindari kafein di sore dan malam hari.** Minuman yang mengandung kafein seperti kopi, teh, dan soda bisa membuat Anda lebih sulit untuk tidur jika dikonsumsi di sore atau malam hari. 5. **Letakkan segala kebutuhan pagi hari secara strategis.** Menyiapkan pakaian sekolah, tas, dan perlengkapan lainnya pada malam hari bisa mengurangi keburu-buru di pagi hari dan memberikan Anda beberapa menit ekstra untuk bangun dan bersiap. 6. **Buka tirai atau gorden.** Cahaya alami pada pagi hari bisa membantu mengatur jam internal tubuh Anda dan membuat Anda lebih mudah untuk bangun. 7. **Rutinitas pagi yang menyenangkan.** Buatlah rutinitas pagi yang Anda nikmati, seperti menyiapkan sarapan favorit atau mendengarkan musik, agar Anda memiliki motivasi untuk bangun dari tempat tidur. 8. **Latihan fisik ringan.** Melakukan peregangan atau latihan ringan setelah bangun bisa membantu menghilangkan rasa kantuk dan membuat Anda lebih siap untuk memulai hari. Ingat, konsistensi adalah kunci untuk membangun kebiasaan bangun pagi. Mungkin sulit pada awalnya, tetapi dengan terus berlatih dan mengikuti tips-tips ini, Anda bisa menjadi lebih mudah untuk bangun lebih awal dan merasa lebih siap untuk menghadapi hari. Semoga sukses!"},{"prompt":"Give me a list of Authors with almost the exact same writing style as this sample: In the sprawling metropolis of Featherstone—a city that prided itself on being as average as a Tuesday afternoon—a peculiar phenomenon unfolded, one that would shake the very foundations of the Internet and test the boundaries of human credulity. The catalyst of this digital tempest? A photo. But not just any photo. You see, Featherstone was home to Gerald, a middle-aged, balding accountant with a penchant for perfectly ordinary suits and a life so mundane that even his goldfish seemed to yawn in his presence. Gerald, by all accounts, led a life as thrilling as watching paint dry on a humid day. That is, until the day he unwittingly became a viral sensation. On an exceptionally ordinary Wednesday—so ordinary, in fact, that even the weather couldn't be bothered to be anything other than “meh”—Gerald decided to spice up his life by ordering a sandwich from a new delicatessen instead of his usual ham and cheese from the corner shop whose owner perpetually looked like he’d witnessed the decline of Western civilization. This sandwich, an avant-garde assembly of ingredients known to few and mastered by fewer, was christened “The Gastronomic Enigma.” It boasted layers of exotic meats and cheeses, a secret sauce rumored to be crafted under the light of a full moon, and greens that Gerald suspected might just be regular lettuce trying its best to look exotic. Gerald, in a burst of unprecedented spontaneity, decided to commemorate the occasion with a photo. There he stood, beside his desk, adorned with nothing but a stapler and a despondently wilting potted plant, holding aloft The Gastronomic Enigma. The sandwich, in a twist of fate, looked remarkably like a smirk. A well-meaning colleague snapped the photo, which Gerald, feeling a peculiar blend of pride and excitement, uploaded to his seldom-visited social media profile with the caption, “Braving the unknown. #LunchAdventures.” What happened next was equivalent to tossing a lit match into a barrel of fireworks. Somehow, the photo of Gerald, an ordinary man about to engage in the extraordinary act of eating an overly ambitious sandwich, captivated the internet’s collective imagination. Perhaps it was the way the fluorescent lighting haloed his bald spot, or maybe the undeniable charisma of The Gastronomic Enigma, but the photo transcended its mundane origins to become a viral sensation overnight.","completion":"The writing sample provided features a combination of whimsy, satire, and an attention to mundane detail that is then turned on its head to reveal the extraordinary within the ordinary. Authors and works that share a similar style, blending the everyday with the absurd, sharp humor, and a penchant for exploring the human condition through a slightly distorted lens include: 1. **Douglas Adams** - Known for \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\\" Adams' style is characterized by its blend of science fiction, dry wit, and contemplations on the absurdity of human (and alien) existence. 2. **Terry Pratchett** - His \\"Discworld\\" series offers a satirical take on fantasy tropes, real-world issues, and an exploration of humanity with humor and depth, all while playing with language in a way that might remind one of the sample's playful tone. 3. **Neil Gaiman** - While his tone can range from darkly serious to whimsically humorous, works like \\"Good Omens\\" (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) showcase his ability to blend the ordinary with the fantastical in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking. 4. **Christopher Moore** - An author of comic fantasy and satire, Moore’s novels, such as \\"Lamb\\" and \\"Fool,\\" often take an irreverent look at the mundane and mythological worlds, making the extraordinary accessible and funny. 5. **Jonas Jonasson** - Known for \\"The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared,\\" Jonasson mixes historical events with absurdity and humor, focusing on ordinary characters who find themselves in extraordinary circumstances. 6. **David Wong** - In \\"John Dies at the End\\" and its sequels, Wong blends horror, science fiction, and comedy to explore bizarre, supernatural happenings in the lives of very ordinary and somewhat flawed characters. 7. **Kurt Vonnegut** - With a unique blend of satire, science fiction, and dark humor, Vonnegut’s works, such as \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" and \\"Cat’s Cradle,\\" explore the absurdity of human existence in a style that plays with narrative form and convention. 8. **Tom Robbins** - Offering vibrant characters, playful language, and plots that twist the mundane into the magical, Robbins’ novels, like \\"Still Life with Woodpecker\\" and \\"Jitterbug Perfume,\\" celebrate the whimsy and weirdness of life. 9. **Nick Harkaway** - In works like \\"The Gone-Away World\\" and \\"Gnomon,\\" Harkaway weaves complex narratives that mix the bizarre with the deeply human, all wrapped in a distinctively wry tone. 10. **Matt Haig** - Particularly in \\"The Humans,\\" Haig uses humor and tenderness to explore what it means to be human, focusing on the extraordinary aspects of our mundane world through an outsider’s perspective. These authors, like the sample, excel in creating worlds where the line between the mundane and the magical is blurred, where humor and human insight intertwine, and where the storytelling invites readers to view the ordinary in extraordinary ways."},{"prompt":"6.4*10^6 + 3.5*10^6 in sintifc notofcation","completion":"9.9*10^6"},{"prompt":"Error in predict.xgb.Booster(den.resid.xgb, as.matrix(Grid5_xgb[, all.vars(formulafullden)[-1]]), : Feature names stored in \`object\` and \`newdata\` are different!什么意思","completion":"这个错误意味着对象和新数据中存储的特征名称不相同。这可能是因为数据集中的列名与模型中使用的列名不匹配。要解决这个问题，您需要确保新数据集中的列名与模型训练时使用的列名完全一致。您可以检查列名，确保它们匹配，然后重新运行预测。"},{"prompt":"ortu ku sibuk kerja gmna donk","completion":"Kalau orang tua kamu sibuk bekerja dan kamu merasa membutuhkan lebih banyak waktu bersama mereka, ada beberapa cara yang bisa kamu coba untuk meningkatkan kualitas waktu yang kamu punya bersama mereka. Berikut adalah beberapa tips yang bisa kamu pertimbangkan: 1. **Jadwalkan Waktu Berkualitas**: Coba minta untuk menjadwalkan waktu berkualitas bersama. Waktu ini tidak harus lama, tapi buatlah menjadi berkualitas, seperti makan malam bersama tanpa gangguan gadget, melakukan aktivitas luar bersama di akhir pekan, atau menonton film favorit bersama. 2. **Komunikasi adalah Kunci**: Ungkapkan perasaanmu kepada orang tua dengan cara yang baik dan dewasa. Jelaskan bahwa kamu mengerti mereka sibuk bekerja demi keluarga, tapi kamu juga merindukan waktu bersama mereka. Kadang-kadang, orang tua mungkin tidak menyadari bahwa kamu merasa seperti ini. 3. **Buat Mereka Terkejut**: Kamu juga bisa membuat kejutan kecil bagi mereka, seperti menyiapkan makan malam, atau merapikan rumah. Hal-hal kecil bisa membuat perbedaan besar dalam menunjukkan kasih sayang kamu pada mereka. 4. **Bantulah Mereka**: Dengan membantu pekerjaan rumah atau pekerjaan lainnya, kamu bisa mengurangi beban orang tuamu. Ini juga bisa memberi mereka lebih banyak waktu luang yang mungkin bisa dia habiskan bersama kamu. 5. **Manfaatkan Teknologi**: Jika orang tuamu sering bepergian atau kamu tidak bisa bertemu dengan mereka secara langsung, manfaatkan teknologi seperti video call untuk berkomunikasi. Ini bisa membuat kamu merasa lebih dekat dengan mereka walaupun secara fisik terpisah. Ingatlah bahwa orang tua kamu bekerja keras, mungkin, untuk memberi keluarga kondisi hidup yang lebih baik. Jadi, mencoba memahami posisi mereka juga penting. Tapi tidak salah juga mengutarakan perasaanmu karena keluarga seharusnya merupakan tempat untuk berbagi suka dan duka."},{"prompt":"cara kuat kaya hulk","completion":"Untuk menjadi kuat seperti Hulk dalam kehidupan nyata, tentu saja kita tidak bisa berubah menjadi raksasa hijau dengan kekuatan super. Namun, kita bisa mengambil inspirasi dari karakter Hulk untuk membangun kekuatan fisik dan ketahanan tubuh melalui praktek dan dedikasi. Berikut adalah beberapa saran untuk memulainya: 1. **Latihan Rutin**: Rencanakan rutinitas latihan yang mencakup latihan beban dan latihan kekuatan untuk membangun massa otot. Latihan seperti squat, deadlift, dan bench press sangat efektif untuk membangun kekuatan dasar. 2. **Pola Makan Sehat**: Untuk mendukung pertumbuhan otot dan pemulihan, pastikan Anda mengonsumsi cukup protein, karbohidrat, dan lemak sehat. Konsultasikan dengan ahli diet atau nutrisi untuk menyusun diet yang sesuai dengan kebutuhan dan target Anda. 3. **Istirahat Cukup**: Otot membutuhkan waktu untuk pulih dan tumbuh setelah latihan. Pastikan Anda mendapatkan cukup tidur dan memberikan waktu untuk otot Anda untuk pulih dengan tidak melatih grup otot yang sama setiap hari. 4. **Hidrasi Tubuh**: Minum cukup air sangat penting untuk kesehatan secara umum dan untuk memaksimalkan performa saat berolahraga. Air membantu dalam pemulihan otot dan menjaga tubuh tetap terhidrasi. 5. **Disiplin dan Konsistensi**: Sama seperti Hulk yang memiliki kekuatan luar biasa, Anda juga perlu memiliki komitmen dan disiplin tinggi dalam menjalankan rencana latihan dan pola makan yang telah ditentukan. 6. **Pendekatan Mental**: Hulk memiliki kemarahan yang menjadi sumber kekuatannya. Dalam konteks nyata, gunakan motivasi dan mental positif sebagai sumber tenaga Anda. Tetapkan tujuan yang realistis dan tetap fokus terhadap pencapaian tersebut. 7. **Konsultasi dengan Profesional**: Pertimbangkan untuk bekerja sama dengan pelatih pribadi yang dapat membantu Anda menentukan program latihan dan nutrisi yang paling efektif sesuai dengan kondisi fisik saat ini dan tujuan Anda.

ZPL allows the designing of complex labels that can include barcodes, text, lines, and graphics. This particular piece of ZPL code is designed to configure a label and print it. Let's break down what each command does: - \`U1 setvar \\"device.languages\\" \\"zpl\\"\`: This command is setting the device language to ZPL. - \`N\`: Clear the image buffer. This command initializes the start of a new label format; it clears the printer's buffer of any previous commands or formats. - \`ZB\`: Change the printing direction to backfeed before print. It controls whether the label will backfeed before printing, which can be useful for ensuring the starting print position is correct after peeling off the last printed label. - \`S3\`: Sets the speed of the printer. The number after 'S' represents the print speed. Speeds can vary by printer model. - \`D10\`: Sets the density (print darkness). The density levels can range with different values affecting how dark the printout will be. - \`R02,0\`: Sets the reference point for the print position on the label. The numbers indicate the x and y coordinates in dots. - \`q240\`: Sets the label width to 240 dots. - \`Q160,120\`: Sets the label length to 160 dots, with a gap length (for label separation) of 120 dots. - \`A05,135,3,2,1,1,N,\\"\\"\`: Defines a text field with specific font, size, and rotation settings but, as the text content is empty (\\"\\"), no text will be printed for this command. - \`B30,10,0,1C,2,7,75,B,\\"9930348263\\"\`: This is a barcode command. It specifies the position (30 dots from the left and 10 dots from the top), barcode type (Code 128 here, indicated by \\"1C\\"), magnification factors, the height of the bar code, and finally the barcode data (\\"9930348263\\"). - \`I8,C,001\`: This command is not standard ZPL and may be intended for printer-specific feature or configuration, often related to media handling or print job control. - \`A30,118,0,1,1,1,N,\\"\\"\` and \`A20,137,0,1,1,1,N,\\"\\"\`: These commands are for additional text fields similar to the first \`A\` command but positioned differently and also with no text to be printed. - \`P1\`: Print one copy of the label. Overall, this ZPL script configures a label with a specific barcode (\\"9930348263\\"), but it also includes some placeholder commands for text that don't actually print any text because the content is empty. The specific purpose seems to be to demonstrate barcode printing with certain parameters, possibly for a label used for products or inventory."},{"prompt":"Does not this need to have ^ character in the beginning of each line?","completion":"Yes, you're correct. In standard Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) syntax, commands typically start with a caret (^) character (e.g., \`^XA\`, \`^FO\`, \`^FD\`, \`^FS\`). The code snippet provided in the question does not include the caret (^) symbols that are usually required at the beginning of each command line in ZPL. It's possible that the snippet provided was simplified or transcribed in a way that omitted these characters. A valid version of the snippet, following standard ZPL formatting, would look more like this (assuming a direct translation of your original commands into standard ZPL format and making reasonable assumptions for some of the commands that don't translate directly): \`\`\`zpl ^XA ^FWB ^PW240 ^LL160 ^LS120 ^FO05,135^A0N,30,30^FD^FS ^FO30,10^BCN,75,Y,N,N^FD9930348263^FS ^PQ1 ^XZ \`\`\` Here's a breakdown with the caret (^) included and some adjustments for standard syntax: - \`^XA\`: Begin the label format. This marks the start of a ZPL script. - \`^FWB\`: Sets the default field orientation. In the original code, \`ZB\` seems to intend to backfeed, but in the standard ZPL, field orientation and backfeed are handled differently. This command might not directly correspond but is an approximation. For backfeeding, commands like \`^LS\` for label shift or specific media handling commands are used. - \`^PW240\`: Label width. Sets the print width to 240 dots. - \`^LL160\`: Label length. Sets the label length to 160 dots. - \`^LS120\`: Shifts the label content, could be used as an alternative to set a gap, but usually, it's for shifting the start of print on the label. - \`^FO30,10\`: Field origin. Sets the position where the next field is printed. - \`^BCN,75,Y,N,N\`: Barcode 128 command. The \`N\` stands for normal rotation, \`75\` for the bar height, and the \`Y\` indicates that human-readable text is printed below the barcode. - \`^FD\`: Field data. This is used to define the data for text fields or barcode content but was not correctly represented in the original snippet provided. - \`^FS\`: Field stop. Marks the end of the data for a particular field. - \`^PQ1\`: Print quantity. Specifies how many labels to print. - \`^XZ\`: End of the label format. Adjustments were made to closely align with standard ZPL usage and to correct for typical syntax requirements. However, without the leading carets or additional standard commands (\`^FO\`, \`^FD\`, \`^FS\`) in your original snippet, the provided commands would not work as intended on a Zebra printer. The corrected version above adheres to these standards and provides a more accurate representation of how ZPL is usually written."},{"prompt":"rewrite this code with carrets: U1 setvar “device.languages” “zpl” N ZB S3 D10 R02,0 q240 Q160,120 A05,135,3,2,1,1,N,“” B30,10,0,1C,2,7,75,B,“9930348263” I8,C,001 A30,118,0,1,1,1,N,“” A20,137,0,1,1,1,N,“” P1","completion":"To rewrite the provided code using the correct syntax with carets (\`^\`) for ZPL (Zebra Programming Language), we need to approximate some of the commands as not all lines in the original snippet directly map to standard ZPL commands or the specified functionality may not exist as described.

Sets the reference point for the label format. This corresponds to the 'R02,0' instruction. - \`^PW240\`: Label width. Sets the print width in dots. - \`^LL160\`: Label length. Sets the label length in dots. - \`^FO05,135\`: Field origin. Specifies the position at which a field is placed on the label. - \`^A0N,30,20\`: Font and size. This command specifies the font orientation (normal in this case), and font size. The numbers are placeholders as the original command didn't translate directly. - \`^FS\`: Field stop. Ends the definition of a ^FO command. - \`^FO30,10\`: Field origin for the barcode. Specifies where the barcode begins on the label. - \`^BCN,75,Y,N,N\`: Barcode Code 128 with normal orientation, height of 75, and human-readable interpretation printed. - \`^FD9930348263\`: Field data for the barcode. - \`^PQ1\`: Print quantity. Specifies that one copy of the label format will be printed. - \`^XZ\`: End of the label format. Each line of code starts with a caret symbol (\`^\`), denoting a ZPL command. The original commands such as \`U1 setvar “device.languages” “zpl”\`, \`ZB\`, and \`I8,C,001\` do not have direct ZPL II command counterparts or are configurations that would be executed outside of a label format (e.g., through printer settings or a programming manual/script). The Zebra Programming Guide provides details on setting printer language or other configurations, often through SGD (Set-Get-Do) commands or Zebra Setup Utilities, rather than within the ZPL label format script itself."},{"prompt":"How to change font using ^CF","completion":"The \`^CF\` command in Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) is used to change the default font and font size for text fields in a label format. The syntax for the \`^CF\` command is as follows: \`\`\` ^CFf,h,w \`\`\` Where: - \`f\` is the font to be used. - \`h\` is the font height in dots. - \`w\` is the font width in dots. # Font Selection (\`f\`) The \`f\` parameter specifies the font to be used. This can be any of the pre-defined fonts in the Zebra printer, such as \`A\` through \`Z\` and \`0\` through \`9\`. The availability of fonts can vary between printer models, so you'll want to consult your printer's documentation for a list of supported fonts. # Font Height and Width (\`h\`,\`w\`) - The \`h\` parameter specifies the height of the font in dots. - The \`w\` parameter specifies the width of the font in dots. If you want the width to be automatically adjusted based on the height, you can omit this parameter or set it to \`0\`. # Examples 1. **Change font to A with height and width** To change the font to type A with a height of 30 dots and a width of 20 dots: \`\`\` ^XA ^CF0,30,20 ^FO100,100^FDThis is a test.^FS ^XZ \`\`\` This command sets the default font to \\"A\\" (specified by \`0\`) with a height of 30 dots and a width of 20 dots for the text \\"This is a test.\\" which starts at coordinates (100,100). 2. **Change font to B with height only** If you only want to set the height and allow the printer to automatically adjust the width, you might use: \`\`\` ^XA ^CFB,40 ^FO100,150^FDAnother test.^FS ^XZ \`\`\` This sets the default font to \\"B\\" with a height of 40 dots. The width is automatically adjusted to maintain font proportions. 3. **Change back to default settings** If you want to switch back to the printer's default font settings after changing them: \`\`\` ^XA ^CF0 ^FO100,100^FDDefault font and size.^FS ^XZ \`\`\` This resets the font to the printer's default (usually \\"0\\" or the A font). # Important Notes - When changing font sizes with \`^CF\`, subsequent text fields in your label format (\`^FD\` commands) will use these settings until you specify another \`^CF\` command with different settings. - The exact appearance of fonts and how they are scaled might vary depending on your printer model and its DPI (dots per inch). - Always test your label designs to ensure that the font sizes and types meet your requirements."},{"prompt":"After executing this code on printer all barcodes are shifted to the left.

В.\\" A20,137,0,1,1,1,N,\\"\\" P1","completion":"If after executing the code on your Zebra printer you notice that all barcodes (and possibly text or any other fields) are shifted to the left and you want to undo these changes, there are mainly two things you should consider to rectify the situation: 1. **Resetting Label Home Position (\`^LH\`)**: - The original code you provided had an \`R02,0\` command that doesn't directly correlate with standard ZPL II commands. However, assuming it was meant to adjust the reference (home) position for the label to \`X=2\`, \`Y=0\`, this could be why your content is shifted. In standard ZPL II, the \`^LH\` command sets the label home position (the point of origin for the label). To reset this to the default (usually \`0,0\`), you can use the \`^LH\` command without the parameters or with \`0,0\` parameters. - Example to reset: \`^XA^LH0,0^XZ\` 2. **Reviewing and Adjusting the Field Position (\`^FO\`)**: - The \`^FO\` command sets the field origin (i.e., where a label element starts), and it's possible the shifts are due to specific \`^FO\` settings in the code. Review the coordinates in your \`^FO\` commands to ensure they are correct for your desired layout. If the issue is persisting because of some configuration changes that got saved into the printer (which seems less likely given your script, but could happen with other settings), you might want to consider: 3. **Restoring Printer to Factory Defaults**: - Be cautious with this step as it will remove all custom settings. You can restore your Zebra printer to factory defaults by using the Zebra Setup Utilities or by entering a command manually if your printer supports it. This can typically be done through the printer's menu or a specific command such as \`^JUF\` or \`^JUN\` for some models, but it's essential to consult your printer's user manual as this varies by model. 4. **Consult the Printer Manual for Specific \`setvar\` Commands**: - The \`U1 setvar \\"device.languages\\" \\"zpl\\"\` command suggests you are setting a variable, possibly changing the printer language to ZPL. To undo any specific settings changes made via \`setvar\`, you will need to identify the default or desired value and set it back. If you are unsure, refer to the printer's manual or use the Zebra Setup Utilities. 5. **Checking Other Commands for Side Effects**: - If your script contained other configuration commands (\`S3\`, \`D10\`, \`q240\`, \`Q160,120\`, etc.), make sure these are set to values that align with your printing needs. Adjusting them back to their previous settings or default may solve the issue. Always ensure to test with a simple label design first to isolate the cause of the shift and verify that your adjustments correct the issue. If the problem persists, consulting the printer’s user guide or reaching out to Zebra's technical support can provide additional guidance tailored to your specific model."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These could include: 1. **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: This is one of the most common and serious causes of chest pain in older adults. CAD occurs when the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become hardened and narrowed due to the build-up of cholesterol and plaque. This can reduce blood flow to the heart, especially during activities like fast walking or jogging, leading to chest pain or angina. 2. **Hypertension-induced angina**: High blood pressure can put extra strain on the heart, possibly leading to angina under physical exertion. 3. **Aortic stenosis**: This condition involves the narrowing of the aortic valve, which can restrict blood flow from the heart into the aorta and onward to the rest of the body. Exertion can exacerbate symptoms, leading to chest pain. 4. **Pulmonary conditions**: Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary hypertension can also cause chest discomfort during physical activities due to decreased oxygen exchange or increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries. 5. **Myocardial bridge**: A congenital condition where a band of heart muscle lies over a section of a coronary artery, typically not causing symptoms until later in life. Physical exertion can precipitate chest pain due to the coronary artery's inability to adequately supply blood during periods of increased demand. 6. **Microvascular disease**: This condition affects the heart's smallest coronary artery blood vessels and can lead to chest pain during exercise or stress. 7. **Anemia**: Low levels of hemoglobin in the red blood cells can lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the heart muscle during increased physical activity, resulting in chest pain. 8. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Though not related to the heart, GERD can cause a burning sensation or pain in the chest, which may be mistaken for angina. Physical activity can exacerbate GERD symptoms. 9. **Musculoskeletal problems**: Chest pain can also arise from issues with the muscles and bones in the chest wall, especially if the individual has recently increased their exercise intensity or changed their routine. It is critical for anyone experiencing new or worsening chest pain, especially during physical activity, to seek medical evaluation promptly. This is essential not only for diagnosing potentially life-threatening conditions like CAD but also for identifying other treatable causes of their symptoms. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve outcomes in conditions leading to chest pain upon exertion."},{"prompt":"What tests would you recommend to do to narrow down the causes","completion":"When investigating the cause of mild to moderate chest pain in a 65-year-old individual, especially one previously capable of jogging with no issues, a physician will typically recommend a series of tests. These tests are designed to assess cardiovascular health, rule out serious conditions, and identify any potential causes of the symptoms. A comprehensive approach may include: 1. **Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG)**: This is often the first test done to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart that might indicate ischemia (lack of blood flow), previous heart attacks, or other heart conditions. 2. **Exercise Stress Test**: Also known as a treadmill test, this evaluates how well the heart functions under physical stress. It can help determine if the pain is related to heart disease, especially coronary artery disease. 3. **Echocardiogram**: This ultrasound of the heart provides images that show the heart's chambers, valves, and the pumping action of the heart. It can identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart, areas of the heart that aren't contracting normally, and previous damage to the heart muscle. 4. **Blood tests**: Specific tests can detect enzymes and other substances in the blood that are associated with heart muscle damage. Also, tests like a complete blood count (CBC) can identify anemia, and lipid profiles can help assess cardiovascular risk factors. 5. **Chest X-ray**: To view the lungs, heart, and chest wall, helping to rule out other conditions that could cause or contribute to the patient's symptoms, such as pneumonia or heart failure. 6. **Coronary Angiography**: If noninvasive tests suggest coronary artery disease, coronary angiography, which involves using X-ray imaging to see the heart's blood vessels, may be warranted. This is often done in conjunction with cardiac catheterization, which can measure pressures in the heart chambers. 7. **CT Coronary Angiogram**: A less invasive test than traditional coronary angiography, this uses CT imaging to visualize the coronary arteries and can detect plaque build-up and blockages. 8. **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs)**: To assess lung function and rule out conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially if symptoms like shortness of breath are present. 9. **Gastrointestinal evaluation**: If a gastroesophageal cause like GERD is suspected, tests such as an upper endoscopy may be recommended to examine the esophagus and stomach lining. 10. **Musculoskeletal examination**: For chest wall pain, a detailed physical examination or imaging tests like MRI may be used to identify musculoskeletal issues. The specific combination of tests will depend on the individual's medical history, risk factors, and the characteristics of their chest pain. The physician will use these results to guide diagnosis and treatment plans, addressing the underlying cause of the chest pain. It's important to follow medical advice and complete the recommended testing to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."},{"prompt":"Pick the top most likely causes","completion":"For a 65-year-old who previously had no issues with jogging and now experiences mild to moderate chest pain when walking fast, the top most likely causes, considering commonality and risk factors associated with age, would include: 1. **Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**: Given the age and the symptom of chest pain during exertion, CAD is a leading concern. It occurs due to the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. 2. **Hypertension-induced Cardiovascular Changes**: High blood pressure over time can lead to changes in the heart's structure and function, including left ventricular hypertrophy, which can increase the risk of chest pain during exertion due to increased heart muscle demands. 3. **Aortic Stenosis**: This condition, often related to age, involves the narrowing of the aortic valve, which can restrict blood flow from the heart and cause chest pain during activities that increase the heart's workload. 4. **Microvascular Disease**: Particularly in women, microvascular disease affects the heart's smaller coronary arteries and can lead to chest pain during exertion despite the main coronary arteries being clear. 5. **Anemia**: In the elderly, anemia can be a common issue due to various factors including nutritional deficiencies and chronic diseases. Anemia reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, which can manifest as chest pain during increased physical activity. These conditions are considered highly relevant for an individual in this age group presenting with these symptoms. It's critical to undergo a thorough medical evaluation to determine the exact cause, as many of these conditions share similar symptoms but require different treatments. Initial investigations would likely include an assessment of the patient's medical history, a physical examination, and basic diagnostic tests such as an ECG, echocardiogram, and exercise stress test, with further testing guided by these initial results."},{"prompt":"How to diagnose cad","completion":"Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is diagnosed through a combination of medical history assessment, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests that evaluate the heart's function and the condition of its blood vessels. The following steps and tests are commonly employed to diagnose CAD: # 1. **Medical History and Physical Examination** - **Medical History**: The healthcare provider will ask about symptoms (such as chest pain, breathlessness), risk factors (like smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease), and lifestyle habits. - **Physical Exam**: Listening for sounds that indicate heart issues, checking for signs of circulatory problems, or physical manifestations of heart disease. # 2. **Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG)** An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart. It can show abnormal heart rhythms, areas of ischemia (poor blood flow), and evidence of previous heart attacks. # 3. **Blood Tests** Blood tests can detect increased levels of certain substances like cardiac biomarkers (troponins) which leak into the blood when the heart is damaged. Lipid profiles to assess cholesterol levels and other blood tests to check for markers of inflammation can also be indicative of CAD. # 4. **Echocardiogram** An echocardiogram uses ultrasound waves to create images of the heart, showing how well the heart's chambers and valves are working. It can also identify areas of poor blood flow to the heart and areas of heart muscle that are not contracting normally. # 5. **Exercise Stress Test** Also known as a treadmill test, it monitors the heart's activity during physical exertion. It can reveal problems with blood flow within the heart that might not be noticeable otherwise. # 6. **Nuclear Stress Test** This involves injecting a radioactive dye and taking images of the heart while at rest and during exertion. It helps identify areas of the heart that may not be receiving enough blood flow. # 7. **Coronary Angiography and Cardiac Catheterization** A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the heart, where a dye that is visible by X-ray is injected to outline the arteries and heart chambers. This test can show blockages in the coronary arteries. # 8. **CT Coronary Angiogram** This non-invasive test uses a CT scanner to take detailed images of the heart arteries. It can detect plaque buildup and blockages in the coronary arteries. # 9. **Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA)** MRA is a type of MRI scan that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of the blood vessels. It can assess blood flow and detect blockages. # 10. **Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)** These can be performed during cardiac catheterization for a more detailed evaluation of the coronary arteries, providing information about the severity and specific locations of blockages. The choice of diagnostic tests depends on the individual's symptoms, risk factors, and overall health. A combination of these tests helps health care providers diagnose CAD, assess its severity, and plan appropriate treatment to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of heart attacks."},{"prompt":"Escriba 2 frases largas referidas a la amistad","completion":"\\"La amistad es un vínculo especial que une a dos personas mediante la confianza, el apoyo mutuo, la lealtad y la comprensión, creando un lazo inquebrantable que trasciende cualquier obstáculo o distancia, y que se nutre de momentos compartidos, risas, lágrimas y experiencias que se convierten en recuerdos imborrables.\\" \\"La amistad es un tesoro invaluable que nos acompaña en los momentos de alegría y tristeza, en las victorias y derrotas, en las risas y en las lágrimas, en las buenas y en las malas épocas, siendo un bálsamo para el alma y un refugio seguro donde podemos ser nosotros mismos sin miedo al juicio ni a la crítica, simplemente siendo aceptados y queridos por lo que somos.\\""},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Ich kann jedoch nicht per SSH vom physischen auf die VM verbinden. Ich vermute das das Physische system nicht im 192.168.56.0 Netz lieg","completion":"Wenn Sie Probleme haben, sich über SSH von Ihrem physischen Debian-Server zu einer in VirtualBox eingerichteten VM zu verbinden, und Sie vermuten, dass dies daran liegt, dass sich der physische Server nicht im gleichen Netzwerk wie die VM (typischerweise dem VirtualBox Host-Only Netzwerk mit dem Standard-IP-Bereich 192.168.56.0/24) befindet, gibt es mehrere Schritte, die Sie unternehmen können, um dieses Problem zu beheben. 1. **Überprüfen Sie das Netzwerkeinstellung der VM:** - Stellen Sie sicher, dass das Netzwerk Ihrer VM auf \\"Host-Only\\" eingestellt ist, wenn Sie möchten, dass sie nur vom Hostsystem erreichbar ist. Alternativ können Sie \\"Bridged\\" wählen, wenn die VM wie ein eigenständiger Host im gleichen Netzwerk wie der physische Server erscheinen soll. \\"NAT\\" ist normalerweise für den Zugriff auf das Internet von der VM aus gedacht, kann jedoch das Erreichen der VM vom Host oder vom Netzwerk komplizierter machen. 2. **Konfigurieren Sie die Netzwerkeinstellungen für VirtualBox:** - Gehen Sie zu den globalen Einstellungen von VirtualBox, wählen Sie \\"Netzwerk\\" und dann \\"Host-Only Networks\\". Stellen Sie sicher, dass ein Adapter existiert (wenn nicht, fügen Sie einen hinzu) und dass dessen Konfiguration mit Ihrem Zielnetzwerk übereinstimmt. Sie können hier auch die IP-Konfiguration anpassen, um sie in dasselbe Netzwerk wie Ihr physisches Gerät einzufügen, falls notwendig. 3. **Überprüfen Sie die Netzwerkkonfiguration auf Ihrem physischen Server:** - Stellen Sie sicher, dass Ihr physischer Server eine IP-Adresse hat, die mit dem Netzwerk Ihrer VM kommunizieren kann. Wenn Sie sich im Host-Only Netzwerk von VirtualBox befinden, benötigen Sie eine zusätzliche Schnittstelle oder eine angepasste Konfiguration, die in dieses Netzwerk passt. Nutzen Sie Befehle wie \`ip a\` oder \`ifconfig\` (abhängig von Ihrer Distribution), um die aktuellen Netzwerkeinstellungen zu überprüfen. 4. **Installieren und konfigurieren Sie SSH auf der VM:** - Stellen Sie sicher, dass der SSH-Server auf Ihrer VM läuft. Sie können dies in der Regel mit einem Befehl wie \`sudo systemctl status ssh\` überprüfen. Wenn der Service nicht läuft, starten Sie ihn mit \`sudo systemctl start ssh\` und ermöglichen Sie ihm, beim Systemstart mit \`sudo systemctl enable ssh\` automatisch zu starten. 5. **Vergewissern Sie sich, dass keine Firewall die Verbindung blockiert:** - Sowohl auf Ihrem physischen Server als auch auf der VM könnten Firewalls aktiv sein, die die SSH-Verbindung blockieren. Überprüfen Sie die Firewall-Einstellungen (z.B. mit \`iptables -L\` auf Linux) und stellen Sie sicher, dass der Port 22 (standardmäßiger SSH-Port) für eingehende Verbindungen zugelassen ist. 6. **Testen Sie die Verbindung:** - Sobald alles konfiguriert ist, versuchen Sie, sich von Ihrem physischen Server mit dem Befehl \`ssh user@vm-ip-adresse\` zu der VM zu verbinden, wobei \`user\` durch den Benutzernamen auf der VM und \`vm-ip-adresse\` durch die tatsächliche IP-Adresse der VM ersetzt wird. Falls es nach diesen Schritten immer noch Probleme gibt, könnte eine detailliertere Fehlermeldung oder die Überprüfung von Log-Dateien (wie \`/var/log/auth.log\` auf der VM für SSH-Versuche) weitere Hinweise auf die Ursache des Problems geben."},{"prompt":"4.

Wie soll ich das tun, wenn ich keine Shell Verbindung zur VM habe?","completion":"Wenn Sie derzeit keinen Shell-Zugang zu Ihrer VM haben, um SSH zu installieren oder zu konfigurieren, können Sie alternative Methoden verwenden, um Zugriff zu erlangen und die notwendigen Einstellungen vorzunehmen. Hier sind einige Optionen: 1. **Direkte Konsole in VirtualBox:** - VirtualBox bietet eine direkte Konsole für jede VM. Sie können Ihre VM starten und dann das VirtualBox-Fenster der VM verwenden, um sich direkt anzumelden, als ob Sie an einem physikalischen Monitor angeschlossen wären. Von hier aus können Sie auf die Shell zugreifen und die benötigten Befehle ausführen. 2. **Verwenden eines Installationsmediums in Rescue- oder Live-Modus:** - Wenn das Betriebssystem Ihrer VM noch nicht vollständig konfiguriert ist oder Sie Zugang zu einem System benötigen, das nicht vollständig bootet, können Sie ein Linux-Installationsmedium (wie eine Debian-ISO) im \\"Live-Modus\\" starten. Mounten Sie dazu die ISO-Datei in VirtualBox als CD/DVD-Laufwerk der VM und starten Sie die VM so, dass sie von dieser ISO bootet. Viele Distributionen bieten einen \\"Rescue-Mode\\" oder \\"Live-Mode\\", der Ihnen ermöglicht, ein temporäres System zu booten und Zugriff auf die Festplatten Ihrer VM zu erhalten. Von dort können Sie die notwendigen Installationen oder Konfigurationen durchführen. 3. **Ändern der Netzwerkeinstellungen zur vorübergehenden Vereinfachung des Zugriffs:** - Wenn das Problem in den Netzwerkeinstellungen liegt, könnten Sie die Netzwerkkonfiguration Ihrer VM temporär auf NAT oder Bridged umstellen, um einfacheren Zugang zu ermöglichen. Insbesondere der Bridged-Modus kann hilfreich sein, wenn Sie der VM eine IP-Adresse aus demselben Netzwerk wie Ihr physisches Gerät zuweisen möchten. Dies könnte es Ihnen ermöglichen, sich über SSH oder eine ähnliche Remote-Verbindung zu verbinden, falls der SSH-Server bereits läuft. 4. **Manuelles Einbinden der VM-Festplatte und Bearbeiten von Konfigurationsdateien:** - Ein weiterer fortgeschrittener Ansatz wäre, die virtuelle Festplatte (VDI-Datei) Ihrer VM in ein anderes Linux-System einzubinden, sei es eine andere VM oder den Host selbst, wenn dieser Linux ausführt. Sobald die Festplatte eingebunden ist, können Sie Systemdateien direkt bearbeiten, z. B. Netzwerkeinstellungen anpassen oder SSH-Konfigurationsdateien ändern. Diese Methode erfordert jedoch ein gutes Verständnis von Linux-Dateisystemen und -berechtigungen. Bitte beachten Sie, dass einige dieser Methoden fortgeschrittene Kenntnisse erfordern und möglicherweise Risiken bergen, insbesondere wenn Sie mit Systemdateien arbeiten. Es ist immer ratsam, Backups zu erstellen, bevor Sie tiefgreifende Änderungen an Ihrem System vornehmen."},{"prompt":"Ich arbeite mit VirtualBox nur in der CI, eine GUI steht mir nicht zu verfügung. \\"2.

Um eine VM in VirtualBox unter Debian (oder jedem anderen Linux-System) im Rescue- oder Live-Modus mittels einer ISO-Datei zu starten, müssen Sie einige Schritte über die Kommandozeile durchführen. # 1. ISO-Datei herunterladen Zunächst müssen Sie eine ISO-Datei des Debian-Installers oder einer anderen Live-CD herunterladen, die Sie verwenden möchten. Angenommen, Sie haben bereits eine ISO-Datei zur Hand. # 2. VirtualBox VM konfigurieren Zu Demonstrationszwecken nennen wir Ihre VM \`MeineVM\`.

VM im Live-Modus starten Sobald die ISO eingebunden ist, können Sie die VM starten. Dies erfolgt auch über die Kommandozeile mit: \`\`\`bash VBoxHeadless --startvm \\"MeineVM\\" \`\`\` # 4. Auf das System im Live-Modus zugreifen Jetzt, wo die VM von der Live-CD bootet, möchten Sie wahrscheinlich Zugriff auf das System erhalten, um die notwendigen Konfigurationen durchzuführen. Da Sie keinen GUI-Zugriff haben, könnten die Optionen hier limitiert sein. Eine Möglichkeit besteht darin, im Voraus zu planen, indem Sie ein Automatisierungsskript auf der ISO haben, das ausgeführt wird, oder indem Sie SSH-Zugriff im Live-System einrichten (wenn die Live-CD dies unterstützt und Sie in der Lage sind, die Netzwerkkonfiguration automatisch zu konfigurieren). # Fehlerbehebung und Alternativen In einer CI-Umgebung ohne GUI-Zugriff kann das Starten einer VM in einem Live-Modus und das Ausführen von Anweisungen oder Reparaturen komplex sein, insbesondere ohne direkten Zugriff auf die Systemkonsole der VM. Eine Alternative ist es, vor dem Hochfahren Ihrer VM die notwendigen Skripte oder Konfigurationen direkt in die VM-Image-Datei einzubetten. Tools wie \`virt-customize\` (Teil des \`libguestfs\`-Pakets) können dazu verwendet werden, Dateien zu einer VM-Image-Datei hinzuzufügen oder Skripte auszuführen, bevor die VM überhaupt gestartet wird. Dieser Ansatz erfordert, dass die VM-Image-Datei zugänglich und modifizierbar ist, bevor sie durch Ihre CI-Pipeline gestartet wird. Bearbeiten Sie VM-Images vorsichtig, da falsche Änderungen das Image beschädigen können.

Das Recht ist sicher kein bloßer ideologischer Überbau, mit dem der Kaiser (der ökonomische oder der politische) nach Belieben verfahren könnte. Dazu greift es zu spürbar in die Verhältnisse ein und kann sie formen. Seine Wirklichkeit und Wirksamkeit aber gründet in der Instanz, die ihm erst die juristische Qualität verschafft und die Kraft zur eigenen Durchsetzbarkeit verleiht; die also dafür sorgt, daß tatsächlich und tagtäglich „quisque jure subjicitur”27. Dem Vorrang des Rechts eignet nichts Originales, nichts Ursprüngliches. Er borgt seine Überlegenheit über Einzelne und Kollektive von der Form Staat. Das Recht besitzt keine Eigenmacht und bleibt ohne staatliche Autorität willenlos: die Willen-losigkeit der UNO, der (wie Hegel sagen würde) kein eigener „praetor” zur Verfügung steht. Das macht die Vormacht des Staats aus und bedingt die Verwandlung des Rechts vom Herrn über die Gesellschaft, ich will nicht sagen zum Knecht, doch zum Diener des Staats. Womit auch das Geheimnis der grundgesetzlichen Verkehrung des Widerstandsrechts enthüllt wäre. Dies bedeutet letztendlich: indem die Verrechtlichung kraft Staatsmacht die Reproduktion in ein ausgedehntes System hinein kanalisiert, geht sie über die einfache Formahsierung der Verhältnisse hinaus und bahnt den Weg für die umfassendere Verstaatung der Gesellschaft.28 Damit ist nicht gesagt, daß dies Schicksal, dieser Kurs schon festgelegt und das Orwellsche Ende, wenn auch verspätet, unvermeidlich wäre. Dagegen steht mindestens in Teilaspekten das Aufbrechen alternativer Projekte, auch wenn deren Träger auf dem sogenannten Parkett der großen Politik schüchtern und unsicher sich bewegen und immer Gefahr laufen, mit den ersten öffentlichen Erfolgen der Anziehungskraft bürgerlicher Institutionen zu erliegen und deren klebriger Faszination auf den Leim zu gehen. Diese Möglichkeit ist nicht von der Hand zu weisen. Nicht nur in Deutschland übt die Vormacht des Staats eine aufsaugende Wirkung aus, läßt die Anpassung an ihre Spielregeln als normales politisches Verhalten und als normativ richtiges Handeln erscheinen - erleichtert also den Übertritt von der radikalen Alternative zur systemimmanenten Alternanz. Vermutlich liegt dies an den Folgen eines theoretischen Mangels, kennzeichnend für Kräfte, die noch auf der Spur zu sich selber sind. Aber der Mangel läßt sich beheben. Nur muß es ihnen gelingen, die eigene, besondere, unvergleichliche Aufgabe, ihre eigene historische Qualität zu erkennen. Die Sache, die sie vertreten, hängt nicht von der Verwirklichung der Arbeitshypothese einer besserungsfähigen Staatsmacht ab, die sich für die Verbesserung der Welt in die Pflicht nehmen ließe; sondern mit der strukturellen Schiefheit und der Inhumanität der Gesellschaft zusammen. Kultur, Politik, Ökonomie, Weltreichtum und Weltmisere stehen nicht abstrakt nebeneinander; sie sind nicht einzeln zur Lösung abrufbar, sobald man an der praktizierten Politik, an der täglichen Aktualisierung der Staatsmacht teilhat. Da hilft der Rekurs auf den Vorrang des Rechts und auf die verbriefte Berechtigung zur gepriesenen Partizipation nicht viel. Diese Lage scheint auf einen Umstand hinzuweisen, der selbst zur ideologischen Schiefheit gehört und die klare Sicht auf das Problem trübt. Da die Vormacht des Staats - und hier liegt wieder ein Unterschied zum Recht vor - immer personalisiert erscheint, läßt sich das Denken leicht zu einer „Verschwörungstheorie” verführen. Gelegentlich habe ich schon davon gesprochen. In Wirklichkeit liegt nichts weniger als Konspiration vor: ein Komplott ideologischer, politischer, wirtschaftlicher Machtgruppen (z. B. der dafür stets bemühten multinationalen Konzerne) zur lückenlosen Manipulation und zur durchgängigen Herrschaft. Verrechtlichung und Verstaatung entspringen keinen dunklen Herrschaftsplänen, sie ergeben sich aus objektiven Bedingungen und scheuen das Licht der Öffentlichkeit nicht. Im Gegenteil: sie bilden sich öffentlich und bilden Öffentlichkeit. Damit ist nicht gesagt, daß es nirgends Absicht gäbe: keine hintergründigen Entwürfe, kein persönliches Streben und keine entsprechenden Praktiken. Es wäre absurd, ausgerechnet auf der Ebene der Staatsmacht den subjektiven Faktor abzustreifen, den man sonst auf der Ebene radikaler Veränderungen (zu deutsch: der Revolution) in den Vordergrund rückt. In der Vormacht des Staates kann jederzeit ein Wille handeln, der die Vormacht als Vollmacht usurpiert. Daher auch Phänomene wie politische Korruption und Mafia. Ihm fehlt aber in heutigen Zeiten das Merkmal der universalen Anmaßung (l'etat c'est moi), des rücksichts- und inhaltslosen Strebens, der reinen Despotie. Leider gerät die Verschwörungstheorie zum Mittel einer Kritik der Politik, die sich an der Personalisierung und der entsprechenden Psychologisierung festrennt, die Expansion der Staatsmacht parallel setzt mit der Expansion des Kapitals und beides dem individuellen Begehren zuordnet. Selbstredend bedarf die institutionelle Strategie der Personen, der Machtträger; gewiß bringen diese ihre eigenen Interessen und Ziele ein. Davon wird die Strategie selbst aber nicht strukturell bestimmt. Dem kann sich auch die Bourgeoisie nicht entziehen. Ich sehe in ihren Positionen, Entscheidungen, in ihrer Zielstrebigkeit keinen reinen „Willen zur Macht” am Werk, sondern das Durchschlagen einer listigen, objektiven Nötigung. Nach dem geschichtlichen Anlauf zur eigenen, ungehemmten Freiheit in der Herrschaft findet sie sich selbst in einer seltsamen Zwangslage wieder. Sie muß sich als herrschend durchsetzen, sonst verschwände sie von der weltgeschichtlichen Bühne. Allerdings, und Marx variierend: in dieser Zwangslage, in der spezifisch politischen Form der Entfremdung fühlt sie sich wohl. In gewisser Hinsicht liegt auch bei der Verstaatung eine Zwangslage vor. Die Ausweitung der staatlichen Vormacht fällt mit einem Prozeß zusammen, in dem die Schwierigkeiten der Reproduktion zum Ausdruck kommen: mit der Erweiterung der Staatsfunktionen im Bereich der gesellschaftlichen Organisation und Regulierung - wobei paradoxerweise selbst die Deregulierung, die poetisch besungene, von Staats wegen besorgt wird. Da braucht man sich durch neoliberale Ideologismen nicht verwirren zu lassen, ebensowenig über die vorgeblich wiederentdeckte Zurückdrängung des Staats zugunsten eines freien Tauschverhältnisses, das als „selbstheilendes” Mittel für die von ihm selbst verursachten Defizite wirken soll. Den modernistischen Strömungen der Neuen Rechten wird es sicher nicht gelingen, den längst verstorbenen Nachtwächterstaat ins Leben zurückzubefördern, der sich offiziell nur um die öffentliche Ruhe kümmerte, zugleich seine Truppen gegen Streikende losschickte. Vermutlich wird es nur Unbedarften gegenüber gelingen, die Wirklichkeit eines starken Staats zu verschleiern und als historischen Endzustand allgemein menschlicher Art ein politisches System auszugeben, das nur für Existenz und Fortdauer der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft sorgt - sie „regierbar” macht. In diesem organisatorisch-normativen Zusammenhang vollzieht sich der Übergang von der liberaldemokratischen Rechtsstaatsfiktion zu dem, was man die „autoritäre Demokratie” genannt hat. Ein Begriff, genauer: ein Wort, dessen Vieldeutigkeit eindeutig den Legitimationszweck hat, die wirkliche Transformation zum autoritären Rechtsstaat zu verdecken. Bekanntlich dient das Wort Demokratie heutzutage ur Rechtfertigung einer jeden Staatsmacht und aller politischen Unternehmungen, ob verfassungsgebunden oder nicht. Und in der Umkehrung gilt jede Kritik an der konstituierten Ordnung als „demokratiefeindlich”. Um uns recht zu verstehen: falsch ist der Vorwurf nicht, wenn die Identität Demokratie - real vorhandener Staat zutrifft. Trifft sie nicht zu, ist der Vorwurf kraftlos. Er läßt sich bestimmt nicht aus der Welt schaffen. Aber er läßt sich gelassen ertragen. Nicht bloß auf der Ebene theoretischer Überlegungen, sondern auch in der täglichen Gesetzgebungsarbeit hat eine Entwicklung begonnen zu dem Ziel hin, das System durch einen totalen Konsens langfristig zu stabilisieren. Auch hier liegt in gewisser Hinsicht eine Notlage vor. Erst der totale Konsens bildet die Voraussetzung für die Akzeptanz von reduzierten individuellen und kollektiven Freiheiten, der neuen, sozusagen disziplinierten Form subjektiver Rechte. Nehmen wir als Beispiel das Parteiengesetz der Bundesrepublik. ”翻译为中文","completion":"然而，事情并非如此。法律绝不是一种可供皇帝（无论是经济上的还是政治上的）随意处理的意识形态上层建筑。法律对现实有着深刻的介入，能够塑造现实。其真实性和有效性基于赋予其法律品质和自行实施的能力的实体；因此确保了“每个人都受法律约束”。法律的优先地位没有任何原创性，没有任何原始性。它从国家形式中借用了对个体和集体的优越性。法律没有自己的力量，没有国家权威就无能为力：联合国的无力，正如黑格尔所说，因为它没有自己的“裁判官”。这就是国家权力的主导地位，使法律从社会的主人，我不想说成为奴隶，但成为国家的仆人。这也揭示了基本法对抗权逆转的秘密。这最终意味着：通过国家权力的法制化将再生产引导到一个广泛的系统中，它超越了关系的简单形式化，并为社会的更加广泛的国家化铺平了道路。 这并不意味着这种命运、这种路径已经确定，奥威尔式的结局即使延迟也是不可避免的。至少在某些方面，替代项目的出现构成了对抗，尽管它们的支持者在所谓的大政治舞台上行动谨慎、不安，并且总是有随着第一次公众成功而被资产阶级机构的吸引力所俘获和陷入其迷人陷阱的风险。这种可能性是不容忽视的。不仅在德国，国家权力的主导地位具有吸收作用，使适应其规则看起来像是正常的政治行为和规范性正确的行动——从而容易地从激进的替代方案过渡到体系内的轮替。这可能是由理论缺陷的后果引起的，这是那些仍在寻找自己道路的力量的特征。但这种缺陷是可以克服的。他们必须认识到自己的特殊、独特的任务和自己的历史品质。他们所代表的事业不依赖于一种改善国家权力的工作假设的实现，该假设可以让其承担改善世界的责任；而是与社会的结构性歪斜和不人道相关。文化、政治、经济、世界财富和世界苦难并不是抽象地并存；它们不能单独解决，一旦参与实践的政治，参与国家权力的日常更新。在这种情况下，回归法律的优先权和对获得赞扬的参与权的认证没有多大帮助。 这种情况似乎指向一个属于意识形态歪斜本身的情况，它模糊了对问题的清晰认识。由于国家权力的主导地位——这里又与法律不同——总是以个人化的形式出现，所以人们很容易被引诱到“阴谋论”。我已经谈过这个问题。实际上，不存在任何阴谋：意识形态、政治、经济权力集团（例如，为此总是努力的跨国公司）的阴谋，以实现无缝的操纵和全面的统治。法制化和国家化不是源自暗黑的统治计划，它们源自客观条件，并不回避公众的关注。相反：它们在公开中形成并塑造公众。这并不是说没有任何意图：没有幕后策划、没有个人追求和相应的实践。在国家权力层面剥去主观因素，而在激进变革（用德语说：革命）层面强调主观因素，这将是荒谬的。在国家权力的主导地位中，随时可能有一种意志行动，该意志将主导地位当作全权。因此，有像政治腐败和黑手党这样的现象。但在今天，它缺乏普遍傲慢的特征（l'etat c'est moi）、无视一切且毫无内容的追求、纯粹的专制。不幸的是，阴谋论成为了政治批评的手段，这种批评坚持于个人化和相应的心理化，将国家权力的扩张与资本的扩张相提并论，并将两者都归因于个人欲望。当然，机构战略需要人，权力持有者；当然，这些人会带入他们自己的利益和目标。但这并不从根本上决定战略本身。资产阶级也无法摆脱这一点。我在她的立场、决策、目的性中看不到纯粹的“权力意志”，而是看到了一个狡猾的、客观的胁迫的体现。在历史上追求自己的、无拘无束的统治自由之后，她发现自己处在一个奇怪的困境中。她必须作为统治者立足，否则就会从世界历史的舞台上消失。尽管如此，变体马克思的话说：在这种特定的政治形式的异化中，她感到很舒适。 在国家化方面，也存在一种困境。国家权力的扩张与再生产困难的出现相一致：与国家在社会组织和调节领域功能的扩展相关——其中讽刺的是，即使是所歌颂的“非管制”也是由国家来负责。不必被新自由主义意识形态混淆，也不用担心所谓的国家权力的重新发现，以便有利于自由交换关系，这被视为治愈它自己造成的缺陷的“自愈”手段。新右翼的现代主义潮流肯定无法将早已消逝的守夜人国家带回生命，而守夜人国家正式只关心公共安宁，同时向罢工者派遣部队。可能只有对不明真相的人来说，能够模糊强国的实际情况，并将其作为一般人类性质的历史终结状态的政治系统——它只是为资本主义社会的存在和持续提供服务——使其“可治理”。 在这个组织性-规范性的背景下，从自由民主法治幻想向所谓的“威权民主”过渡的过程已经开始。一个词，确切地说，一个明确具有合法化目的的多义词，旨在掩盖向威权法治国家的真实转变。众所周知，如今，“民主”的词汇被用来为任何国家权力和所有政治企业辩护，无论它们是否符合宪法。反过来，对现有秩序的任何批评都被视为“民主的敌人”。让我们正确理解：如果民主-实际存在的国家这一身份成立，那么这种指控不是错误的。如果不成立，那么这种指控就没有效力。它绝对不是无中生有。但它可以被平静地接受。 不仅仅在理论考虑的层面，而且在日常的立法工作中，已经开始向通过全面共识长期稳定系统的目标前进。在这里也存在某种程度的紧迫情况。只有全面共识才能为接受减少的个人和集体自由、新的、所谓的纪律性的个人权利形式创造条件。以德国联邦共和国的政党法为例。"},{"prompt":"请将“Es untersagt in keiner Weise, politische Gruppen zu gründen und tätig werden zu lassen. Es erkennt sie jedoch nur als Parteien an, als Verfassungsorgane mit den entsprechenden Rechtsprivilegien29, soweit sie Konsensparteien sind und als solche nicht nur die „Spielregeln” der Verfassung bejahen, sondern auch die einzelnen institutionellen Vorschriften, die die Freiheit programmatischer Entscheidungen inhaltlich bestimmen und also (siehe oben) eingrenzen. Dies gilt auch für die mehrfach diskutierte Frage, ob bestimmte Organisationstypen oder Verfahrensweisen, die aus der Normalität heraustreten (zum Beispiel das Rotationsprinzip), mit der Verfassung Übereinkommen.30 Selbst die Teilnahme einer Partei an den Wahlen erfolgt nicht nur aus einer frei getroffenen politischen Entscheidung heraus; das Gesetz verlangt die Teilnahme, soll der juristische Status der Partei nicht verloren gehen. Das Parteiengesetz gehört in exemplarischer Weise zur Einzäunung, die die Stabilität und Sicherheit des politischen Systems gewährleistet. Tatsächlich wird die Teilnahme an Wahlen genau zu dem Zweck vorgeschrieben, das organische, langsame Wachsen neuer Parteien mit neuen, alternativen Forderungen von Anfang an zu behindern. Wie man weiß, ging die Regelung von der Annahme aus, solchen Parteien gelänge es nicht, die 5 % - Klausel zu überspringen und sich somit eine institutionelle Basis langfristiger Wirksamkeit zu verschaffen. Es wäre Aufgabe einer wirklich alternativen Bewegung, diese Verfassungsmauer zu durchbrechen, ohne sich dabei von der Vormacht des Staats in die Institutionen einfahren zu lassen.31 Spätkapitalismus und Transformation des Staates An dieser Stelle ist es angebracht, zur Transformation des Staats und zu ihren jenseits psychischer Motivationen wirkenden Gründen einige Überlegungen anzustellen. Die sachlichen Zwänge, die zur Ausweitung und Perfektionierung der staatlich durchherrschten Organisation der Gesellschaft führen (unter anderem in den Bereichen Technologie und Information), lassen sich mit zahlreichen Methoden und von vielfältigen Ansätzen her beschreiben. Ich beschränke mich auf einige Hinweise, die auf jeden Fall zu vertiefen wären. Ein erster faktischer Hinweis bezieht sich unmittelbar auf die Produktionsweise, genauer gesagt auf das unmittelbare Innenverhältnis des Kapitals (die „Kapitalbewegung\\") und seine Übersetzung in die Form der Politik.32 Der formalen und mate-rialen Veränderungen des Kapitalismus gibt es viele. Sie reichen von der partiellen Umkehrung in den Beziehungen zwischen den Kapitalen und ihrem Staat bis zu dessen Präsenz auf dem Markt als Einzelkapital in der Sprache bürgerlicher Ökonomie, als Unternehmer. Darüber findet eine geradezu buntscheckige wissenschaftliche Diskussion (an der ich mich anderswo beteiligt habe) statt nebst ideologischen Einfällen. Im Grunde kreist alles um die Möglichkeit immanenter Verschiebungen: ob die Präsenz des Staats im Akkumulationsprozeß und in der Mehrwertproduktion das „Wesen\\" des Kapitalismus schon übersteige; oder ob sie zumindest den Ausgangspunkt für Reformen bilde, die in der völlig staatsfreien Marktwirtschaft nicht möglich wären. Als Beispiel kann hier Umberto Cerronis interessanter Aufsatz „Demokratie als Problem der Massengesellschaft\\" genommen werden, schon weil dieser Autor sich ausdrücklich um den „Rechtsstaat und reifen Kapitalismus\\" sorgt - also um unser Thema. Sein Beitrag ist auf jeden Fall einschlägig, handelt er doch - wie Cerroni schreibt - vom „Übergang des Staates des Kapitals, wie jemand das ausdrückte\\" (dieser jemand wäre ich) „vom kapitalistischen Staat, vom Nachtwächterstaat zum Unternehmerstaat.\\"33 Nur bleibt Cerroni die Natur dieses Übergangs unerklärlich, da er verkennt, daß sich zwischen den beiden „Staaten\\" in Wirklichkeit nur eine Verschiebung in der Form, keineswegs jedoch eine Veränderung in der Funktion feststellen läßt. Der Staat als Unternehmer deckt sich in keiner Weise mit dem Staat, der die Gesellschaft organisiert (dem Staat des Kapitals). Er reformiert den Kapitalismus nicht, geschweige denn, daß er ihn überwände. Er kann es gar nicht, da er in diesem Fall überhaupt nicht mehr Staat, sondern nur ein Unternehmer neben anderen ist: staatlicher Eigentümer im Unterschied zum privaten Eigentümer; auf italienisch noch prägnanter: padrone di Stato statt padrone private Seine, meist schlecht geführten, Unternehmen gehören schlicht zur Realität des freien Markts und dienen nicht einer gleichwie gearteten Planung der Wirtschaft. Es ist zumindest mir nicht bekannt, daß in Italien Staatsbetriebe oder Unternehmen mit staatlicher Beteiligung eine Preis- und Produktionspolitik mit antiinflationären Tendenzen je gefördert hätten; noch hat der Staat als Unternehmer jene „neue Produktionsformen\\" ermutigt, von denen 1969 (in jenem schrecklich heißen Herbst, den man gerne aus der Geschichte streichen möchte) die Mirafiori-Arbeiter träumten. Noch weniger wurde und wird eine gebrauchtswertorien-tierte Zweckbestimmtheit (die bekannte „Finalität\\") der Produktion eingeleitet.34 Weit bedeutsamer als der „Staat als Unternehmer\\" schlagen jene Veränderungen durch, die aus der oligopolistischen Zentralisierung und der Bildung multinationaler Konzerne herrühren. Es braucht hier nicht sonderlich betont zu werden, daß alle diese neuen Formationen auch einen Wandel der staatlichen Strukturen und der rechtlichen Verfahren mit sich bringen. Ich meine damit nicht nur den Bedeutungsverlust der Nationalstaaten und die damit verbundene Notwendigkeit, andere politische Formen zu finden. Eher ist an das Verhältnis zwischen Staat und Gewerkschaften einerseits, andererseits zwischen Kapital und Arbeit zu denken, das auf internationaler Ebene sich anders stellt als im Rahmen nationaler Märkte und auch anders geregelt werden muß - nach Rechtsnormen, die bisher niemand erfand oder erdichtete.35 Dies hat noch nichts mit einer inneren Veränderung zu tun: im Innern einer jeden Form des Kapitals, der oligopolistischen wie der mittleren und kleinen, der verstaatlichten wie der multinationalen Form. Im Innern, das bedeutet: nicht in der Zirkulationssphäre (in der sich Monopole, Oligopole, Konzerne und dergleichen bilden), sondern in der Produktionssphäre selbst. Auch wenn ohne genaue Begrifflichkeit darüber viel geredet wird, vor allem im technologischen Zusammenhang. Es geht dabei um die Restruktuierung der ausgenutzten Arbeitskraft, um Automation, um neue Arten und Möglichkeiten industrieller sowie tertiärer Wertschöpfung. Im gegenwärtigen Kapitalismus (und hier entfällt jede Unterscheidung zwischen privatem und staatlichem Kapital, zwischen Agnelli und dem IRI36) wächst der Anteil der informatisch arbeitenden, computerisierten Maschinerie in immer schnellerem Rhythmus gegenüber der lastenden Langsamkeit und der technischen Nutzlosigkeit des variablen Kapitals. Die Komplexität des industriellen Apparats führt zu andersgearteten Beziehungen zwischen den Produktionsfaktoren und erfordert eine Neufassung des Verhältnisses zwischen Unternehmungsleitung und ausführender Arbeit. Wie Marx in seiner Analyse der Kapitalentwicklung vorausgesehen hat, provoziert in einem reiferen Stadium des Akkumulationsniveaus jede unkontrollierte, der Unternehmensleitung nicht anmanchmal zerstörerische Situationen. Das nicht steuerbare Verhalten der Arbeitskraft, das heißt: jede Form der Autonomie abhängig Arbeitender, die sich nicht um die Kapitalbewegung und ihre Profitrate schert, bedroht das Produktionssystem und schlägt hinüber in die Zirkulationssphäre. Da scheint es zwisehen dem sekundären und tertiären Sektor keine Unterschiede mehr zu geben, was sich umso schärfer auswirkt, als jene goldene Zeit der Akkumulation mit ihren belebenden, in novativen zyklischen Krisen anscheinend der Vergangenheit angehört. Sie ist längst durch eine Krise endemischer Art abgelöst worden, die nicht mehr auf der Ebene der Ökonomie und mit den Mitteln des Marktes zu lösen ist.37 Ich muß hier dem Präsidenten der Confindustria (dem italienischen Dachverband der Unternehmer), Merloni, beipflichten: „Wir wissen fast sicher, daß die ökonomischen Zyklen beendet sind. Es gilt nicht län ger, daß auf eine Phase der Krise eine des Wachstums folgt\\".38 Nur muß das ergänzt werden. Es kann heute ein Wachstum der Produktion eintreten, ohne daß es zur Überwindung gesellschaftlicher Defizite wie Arbeitslosigkeit, Armutsgrenze, Marginalisierung beitrüge.”翻译为中文","completion":"它绝不禁止成立政治团体并让其活动。但它只认可那些作为政党的团体，作为具有相应法律特权的宪法机构，只要它们是共识党派，并且作为这样的党派，不仅肯定宪法的“游戏规则”，而且还肯定单独的制度规定，这些规定在内容上确定了纲领性决策的自由，因此（如上所述）对其进行了限制。这也适用于多次讨论的问题，即是否某些组织类型或做法，因脱离常态（例如轮换制度）而与宪法不符。即使是一个政党参与选举，也不仅仅是出于自由作出的政治决定；法律要求参与，否则政党的法律地位将丧失。政党法在确保政治体系的稳定和安全方面，以示范性的方式充当围栏。实际上，要求参与选举正是为了阻碍新党派缓慢有机成长，并从一开始就阻碍提出新的、替代性要求。众所周知，这一规定是基于这样的假设，即这些政党无法跨越5%门槛，从而无法为自己长期的有效性建立制度基础。 真正的替代性运动的任务应该是打破这面宪法墙，同时避免被国家权力吸纳进制度之中。 晚期资本主义与国家的转型 在这里，有必要就国家的转型及其背后的理由——超越心理动机——进行一些思考。推动国家对社会进行全面和完善管理的实际压力（包括技术和信息领域在内）可以通过多种方法和从多种角度描述。我在此只提供一些需要进一步深入研究的提示。 第一个实际提示直接关系到生产方式，更确切地说，关系到资本的内部关系（“资本运动”）及其转化为政治形式。资本主义的形式和实质变化是多种多样的。它们从资本与其国家之间关系的部分逆转，到国家在市场上作为单一资本以资产者的语言出现。关于此，进行了丰富多彩的学术讨论（我在其他地方也有参与）和意识形态的想象。归根结底，一切都围绕着内在转变的可能性：国家在积累过程和剩余价值生产中的出现，是否已超越了资本主义的“本质”；或者至少是否为在完全无国家的市场经济中不可能实现的改革提供了起点。这里可以引用Umberto Cerroni的有趣文章“大众社会中的民主问题”，因为这位作者明确关心“法治国家和成熟的资本主义”——即我们讨论的主题。他的贡献无疑是相关的，如Cerroni所写，论及“国家的资本转型，正如某人所表达”（这个人就是我），“从资本主义国家、守夜人国家到企业家国家”。只是Cerroni对这种转变的本质不解，因为他没有认识到，两种“国家”之间实际上只是形式的转变，而非功能的变化。作为企业家的国家与组织社会的国家（资本的国家）完全不一致。它既不改革资本主义，更不用说克服它了。它根本就做不到，因为在这种情况下，它根本就不再是国家，而只是其他企业家之一：国家所有者与私人所有者之区别；用意大利语更为明显：国家老板而不是私人老板。它的、大多数管理不善的企业简直是自由市场现实的一部分，而不是任何经济规划的服务对象。至少据我所知，意大利的国营企业或具有国家参与的公司从未推动过具有抗通胀趋势的价格和生产政策；作为企业家的国家也从未鼓励过那些1969年（在那个人们愿意从历史中抹去的炎热的秋天）Mirafiori工人所梦想的“新生产形式”。更不用说引导生产的使用价值取向（著名的“最终目标”）了。 比“国家作为企业家”更深远的变化来自于寡头垄断的集中和跨国公司的形成。需要特别强调的是，所有这些新形态也带来了国家结构和法律程序的变化。我指的不仅仅是国家的意义丧失和需要寻找其他政治形式的必要性。更应该考虑的是国家与工会之间的关系，以及资本与劳动之间的关系，在国际层面上呈现不同于国家市场框架下的形式，也必须以迄今为止没有人发明或构想的法律规范进行调整。 这还不涉及到任何内在变化：在每一种资本形式内部，无论是寡头垄断形式还是中小型形式，无论是国有形式还是跨国形式。内部意味着：不是在流通领域（形成垄断、寡头垄断、企业集团等），而是在生产领域本身。 即便在技术背景下，人们对此广泛讨论并不严谨。这涉及到对被剥削劳动力的重组、自动化、以及工业及第三产业价值创造的新方式和可能性。在现代资本主义中（在这里，私人资本和国有资本之间，Agnelli和IRI之间没有任何区别），信息化工作、计算机化机械的比重与可变资本的缓慢和技术无用性相比，以越来越快的速度增长。工业装备的复杂性导致生产因素之间关系的变化，并要求重新定义企业管理和执行劳动之间的关系。如马克思在其对资本发展的分析中预见到的，在积累水平成熟阶段的每一个不受控制、不归企业管理的、有时候是破坏性的情况，都会引发问题。不可控制的劳动力行为，即：不关心资本运动及其利润率的依赖性劳动者的任何形式的自治，威胁到生产系统，并影响到流通领域。在此，二次和三次产业之间似乎没有区别，这种情况在那个曾经以其活跃、创新的周期性危机为特征的黄金时代看来已是过去，现已被一种内在性质的危机取代，这种危机不再能在经济层面上通过市场手段解决。我必须同意Confindustria（意大利工业联合会）主席Merloni的看法：“我们几乎可以肯定，经济周期已经结束。不再是经历危机阶段之后就会有增长阶段。”只是需要补充的是，如今生产的增长可能发生，但不会有助于克服社会缺陷，如失业、贫困线、边缘化等问题。"},{"prompt":"请将“Ist die Krise nicht länger zyklisch und gibt es keinen ökonomischen Aufschwung auf höherem gesellschaftlichem Niveau mehr, so können freie unternehmerische Entscheidungen, Investitionen, Innovationen und sonstige selbstheilende Kräfte des Marktes den Weitergang der Akkumulation und die geordnete Reproduktion nicht mehr leisten. Die Krise fordert nichtökonomische, präventive Interventionen, die vielleicht marktgerecht sind, aber nicht vom Markt ausgehen. Der Staat muß sich einschalten.39 Damit kehren wir zum komplexen Zusammenhang von objektiven Kapitalerfordernissen und gesellschaftlichen Bedürfnissen zurück. Was letztlich eine totale, wenn auch manchmal ideologisch maskierte Konfrontation darstellt: das Zusammentreffen endemischer Verwertungskrisen und neuer Technologien auf der einen Seite, mit dem autonomen Wiederaufleben einer Reaktion abhängig Arbeitender auf der anderen Seite (die immer gefürchtet wird, selbst in den bleiernen Jahren durchgängiger Anpassung und unterwürfig scheinender Integration) läßt sich am Ende nur dadurch bewältigen, daß alle Formen der Insubordination und der Unbotmäßigkeit in die produktive Disziplin zurückgeholt werden - selbst die unscheinbare alltägliche Form der Trägheit und der Nachlässigkeit beim Arbeiten. Der Kapitaleigner faßt zu Recht dieses Verhalten als Sabotage auf, weil das Kapital sich als einziges historisches Subjekt der produktiven Prozesse begreift, als Inhaber des „Kommandos über die Arbeit” (Marx), dem einzig und allein das Verfügungsrecht über die produktive Arbeit und also auch die Kontrolle über ihre Unterbrechung zusteht - wie der Staat der einzige Inhaber des Rechts auf Gewaltanwendung und des Kommandos über die Bevölkerung ist. So können wir auch verstehen, weshalb die Mailänder Richter Canosa und Santosuosso mit ihrem Urteil, die auf Arbeitslosengeld gesetzten Arbeiter seien bei Alfa wieder einzustellen, eine skandalöse Situation heraufbeschworen. Der wahre Skandal besteht keineswegs (wie mehrfach behauptet) darin, daß Canosa und Santosuosso den Vertretungsanspruch der Gewerkschaften in Sachen Entlassung beiseite geschoben, oder die Berechtigung eines Einverständnisses zwischen Gewerkschaft und Unternehmensleitung abgewiesen hätten. Alle Kritik dieser Stoßrichtung versucht nur, die wirkliche „Missetat” der beiden Richter zu verbergen oder jedenfalls zu verharmlosen. Ihre Urteile bestritten schlichtweg das Recht des Kapitals, eben als einziges Subjekt des Handelns einer Klasse gegenüberzutreten, die sich weigert, nur Objekt restriktiver, vom Gesetz ökonomischer Rentabilität diktierter Maßnahmen zu sein; und die es ablehnt, in ihren eigenen Organisationen nur das institutionelle Instrument des eigenen Zustands von Objekthaftigkeit und Verfügbarkeit zu sehen. Sich auf die Seite derer zu stellen, die der ökonomischen oder politischen Macht widerstehen, ist offenkundig eine unverzeihliche Sünde. In einem Rechtsstaat, der sich ernst nimmt, wären Canosa und San-tosuosso ihrerseits vermutlich selber Objekte geworden: eines Radikalenerlasses - nicht nur wegen ihrer juristischen Ansichten, sondern auch wegen der offen zu Tage tretenden professionellen Unfähigkeit zu erkennen, was eine wohlgeordnete Gesellschaft von ihren Richtern erwartet. In diesem konkreten Fall trug ihr Urteil überdies zur Vertiefung schon vorhandener gesellschaftlicher Widersprüche bei. Aber Widersprüche, Zusammenstöße, Kontraste und eine ausgeprägte Konfliktorientierung können in einer sogenannten Industriegesellschaft nicht geduldet werden.40 Dieser Sachverhalt weist also auf die Notwendigkeit eines Eingriffs mit planendem Charakter hin - nicht Planung des Marktes, sondern der gesellschaftlichen Bedingungen der Produktion, zum Beispiel des Arbeitsmarktes. Daraus folgt nicht, daß die in eine endemische Krise geratene Produktionsweise das Verbot der Konfliktualität erforderlich machte (das wäre unmöglich, denn wir befinden uns in einem Rechtsstaat). Erfor- derlich ist ihre Regulierung (sind wir nun in einem Rechtsstaat oder nicht?). Die Permanenz und der selbstbestimmte Charakter des Konflikts sollen gezügelt, alle seine Möglichkeiten gekappt werden, zum offenen und bewußten Antagonismus durchzubrechen. Vorhin erwähnte ich den Korporativismus. Sicher nicht aus wissenschaftlich abgehobenen Gründen kehrt derzeit das korporativistische Modell ins Rampenlicht zurück, angelegentlich verharmlost in dem Ausdruck „new corporatism\\", also „Neokorporatismus\\". Mit diesem Neologismus versucht man wohl die Nabelschnur zu den historischen Ursprüngen der Sache terminologisch zu durchtrennen. Die korporativistische Versuchung enthüllt genau die schroffe Grenze, die die ökonomische Zwangslage des Spätkapitalismus der freien Artikulation von Konflikten setzt. In einer Krisensituation wie der heutigen kann sich der Kapitalismus im weltweiten Bereich seiner Geltung weder „Abweichungen\\" leisten, noch, daß sie von Rechtsstaats wegen gefördert werden. Er ist allerdings inzwischen um eine Erfahrung reicher geworden, die uns allen zugute kommt. Um Bruchsituationen zu schlichten und zu neutralisieren, um gerade auch aus ihnen sozusagen systemisch Elemente einer normalen und normalisierten Entwicklung zu machen, braucht er den historischen Faschismus nicht. Es kann auch ein korporatives System „ohne Mussolini\\" geben.41 Von einem negativen Blickpunkt her gesehen (im dialektischen Verstand, negativ also zum Kapital) erhebt sich dagegen eine andere Art von Widerspruch, die die allgemeine Perspektive ergänzt und teilweise auch ändern kann. Konfliktualität, erst recht in der radikalen Fassung, ist kein Dauerzustand. Schon aus diesem Grund gilt ihr die Vorsorge des Staats, ihr zuvorzukommen - die präventive, es versteht sich: streng institutionelle Konterrevolution. Der Konfliktualität vorgelagert und eher dauerhaften Charakters sind Protestformen, die sich nicht gegen Ausbeutung und Herrschaft im Kapitalismus richten, sondern aus Unbehagen und Überdruß an seinen Zwecken entstehen. Allerdings schaltet sich auch hier das spezifische Problem der Arbeitswelt ein. Der Überdruß bekundet sich bei den Arbeitern in Italien auch in den bekannten Formen von Absentismus und Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Arbeit; in Deutschland übersetzt sich diese spezifische Art von Verweigerung in den Untergang des Mythos vom ruhigen, rührigen und gehorsamen Arbeiter.42 Diese Art der Absage greift aber auch auf die Sphäre der Reproduktion über und wird von den sogenannten „neuen sozialen Subjekten\\" vorangetrieben. Im Grunde tendieren alle abhängigen Klassen ohne beruflich-traditionelle Festlegung oder Diskriminierung dazu, die harte Schale der Waren-förmigkeit ihres täglichen kollektiven Lebens zu sprengen, wie bequem und verlockend Waren auch sein mögen. So kümmern sie sich nicht um moralische Vorhaltungen und Appelle, in denen von ihnen Opfer und Austerität eingefordert werden. Paradox klingt es schon, wenn hier die Verweigerung der Austerität mit der Absage an die Warenform verbunden wird. Aber unter dem Firnis einer Bedürfnisbefriedigung, die sich um ökonomische Krisen nicht kümmert, kommt deutlich ein kritischer Gedanke zum Vorschein. Nur intellektuelle Leichtfertigkeit, vielleicht auch Heuchelei will als Indifferenz und Wurstigkeit (menfreghismo) in der italienischen, als Egoismus in der deutschen Version hinstellen, was in Wirklichkeit den Protest gegen einseitig diktierte Opfer mit dem legitimen Streben vermält, die Gebrauchswerte, die die eigene Arbeit geschaffen hat, auch zu genießen. (Es lohnt sich, Vergeßliche daran zu erinnern, daß die Politik der Austerität nie die oberen Ränge der Gesellschaft trifft; jene also verschont, die von Opfern reden, seit Jahrhunderten aber in der Befriedigung ihrer Wünsche und Bedürfnisse leben). Die Tendenz zur Bedürfnisbefriedigung (ein Wort, dessen mögliche Eignung zur konservativen Verwendung und Interpretation ich hier unberücksichtigt lasse)43 koppelt sich manchmal mit konkreteren Inhalten an das allgemeine Unbehagen. Sie kann dem Kapitalismus, wenn auch in Grenzen, gefährlich werden, sofern sie - wie ansatzweise in Deutschland - alternative Produktionsformen und -typen vorschlägt oder versucht. Daß dahinter auch eine bloß ideologische Dimension stecken kann, braucht nicht in Abrede gestellt zu werden. Sie läßt sich ohnehin leicht in die schiere institutionelle Logik einer Ökonomie und eines Staats einbauen, die Randerscheinungen ohne umfassende soziale Wirksamkeit durchaus vertragen können. Wichtiger erscheint mir die Tatsache, daß der Beweggrund der „Bedürfnisse” einen intensivierten Bewußtseinsprozeß auf Massenebene bewirken kann. Treffen dabei, und vernünftigerweise, die Kritik an der Zweckbestimmtheit des Kapitalismus und die Kritik am bürgerlichen Staat zusammen, so kann es am Ende zur Bildung und politischen Konkretisierung der gesellschaftlichen Negation kommen. Dazu kann allerdings mit Goethe nur gesagt werden: „Ich lasse euch hoffen”.”翻译为中文","completion":"如果危机不再是周期性的，并且不再有在更高社会水平上的经济复苏，那么自由企业家的决策、投资、创新和市场其他的自愈力量就不能再保持积累的继续进行和有序的再生产了。危机需要非经济性的、预防性干预，这些干预可能符合市场规则，但并非来自市场本身。国家必须介入。 这使我们回到了客观资本要求和社会需求之间复杂关系的话题上。最终这表现为一种全面的，尽管有时被意识形态掩饰的对抗：一方面是根深蒂固的利用危机和新技术的汇合，另一方面是依赖性劳动者自发反应的复苏（即使在持续适应和表面屈从融合的铅灰色年代，这种反应也总是被恐惧）最终只能通过将所有不服从和违抗形式重新纳入生产纪律中来解决——即使是工作中微不足道的日常形式的懒散和疏忽。资本所有者完全有理由将此行为视为一种破坏行为，因为资本自视为生产过程中唯一的历史主体，作为“对劳动的指挥权”（马克思）的持有者，唯一有权对生产性劳动进行支配，因此也有权控制其中断——就像国家是唯一拥有使用暴力和对人口指挥权的实体一样。因此，我们也可以理解为什么米兰的法官Canosa和Santosuosso以裁决让被置于失业金状态的工人重新进入Alfa岗位，激起了一场丑闻。真正的丑闻绝不是（如多次声称的）Canosa和Santosuosso推翻了工会在解雇问题上的代表权要求，或者驳回了工会与公司管理层之间的共识的合法性。所有这类批评都只是试图掩盖或至少淡化这两位法官的真正“罪行”。他们的裁决直接否认了资本作为一个阶级行动的唯一主体的权利，这个阶级拒绝仅作为受限制的、由经济效益法则所决定的措施的对象；并拒绝在自己的组织中仅看到自己被动性和可支配状态的制度性工具。站在抵抗经济或政治权力的一方显然是一个不可原谅的罪过。在一个认真对待自己的法治国家中，Canosa和Santosuosso自己可能会成为对象：因为他们的法律观点，也因为他们明显无法认识到一个有序社会期望其法官们做什么的职业无能。在这个具体案例中，他们的裁决还加深了已经存在的社会矛盾。但是，在所谓的工业社会中，矛盾、冲突、对立和明显的冲突倾向是不被容忍的。 这种情况因此表明了需要进行具有规划性质的干预的必要性——不是对市场的规划，而是对生产的社会条件的规划，例如对劳动力市场的规划。这并不意味着陷入内在危机中的生产方式需要禁止冲突（这是不可能的，因为我们处于一个法治国家）。必需的是其规范（我们现在处于法治国家还是不处于？）。冲突的持久性和自我确定性应该被遏制，它所有的可能性，演变为开放和有意识的对抗性都要被切断。我之前提到了法西斯主义。这并非出于学术上脱离实际的原因，当前法西斯模式以“新法西斯主义”之名重新进入公众视野，有时被轻描淡写地提及。这个新词旨在从术语上切断与该事物历史起源的联系。 法西斯主义的诱惑正好揭示了晚期资本主义的经济困境对冲突自由表达设置的严格界限。在当今这样的危机情况下，全球范围内的资本主义既不能容忍“偏 deviations”，也不能得到法治国家的支持。不过，它已经因我们所有人而获得了更多的经验。为了平息和中和断裂情况，为了将它们就像制度性地变为正常和标准化的发展的一部分，它不需要历史上的法西斯主义。可以有一个没有墨索里尼的企业体系。 从一个对资本来说是负面的（以辩证的理解，对资本是负面的）观点看，另一种类型的矛盾出现了，这种矛盾补充并部分改变了总体视角。冲突性，尤其是在其激进形式下，不是一种永久状态。正因为此，国家的预防措施是预先采取行动——预防性的，当然是：严格的制度性反革命。冲突性之前且更为持久的是抗议形式，它们不是针对资本主义的剥削和统治，而是出于对其目标的不满和厌倦。在意大利，工人的厌倦也表现为众所周知的旷工和对工作的冷漠；在德国，这种特定形式的拒绝转化为安静、勤奋和服从的工人神话的终结。但这种拒绝的表达也扩展到了再生产领域，并被所谓的“新社会主体”推动。归根结底，所有没有职业-传统束缚或歧视的从属阶级都倾向于打破其日常集体生活的商品化的硬壳，无论商品有多舒适和诱人。因此，他们不关心那些要求他们牺牲和节约的道德训斥和呼吁。将节约的拒绝与拒绝商品形式联系起来听起来或许有些矛盾。但在对经济危机漠不关心的需求满足的外表下，清晰地显现出一种批判性的思考。只有轻率或许还有伪善才会将意大利人的冷漠和自私（在德国版本中是自私）视为实际上是拒绝单方面强加的牺牲与合理追求享受自己劳动创造的使用价值的合法努力。（提醒那些健忘的人，节约政策从未触及社会上层；因此，它饶恕了那些谈论牺牲的人，但几个世纪以来他们一直生活在满足自己的欲望和需求中）。 满足需求的倾向（我在这里不考虑这个词可能适用于保守使用和解释的能力）有时会与更具体的内容一起加强普遍的不满。它在一定程度上可能对资本主义构成威胁，只要它——如在德国那样——提出或尝试替代的生产形式和类型。这当然可以有一定的意识形态维度，不需要否认。它无论如何都可以轻松地融入到一个经济和国家的制度逻辑中，这些经济和国家可以完全容忍没有全面社会效应的边缘现象。对我来说，更重要的事实是，“需求”的动机可以在大众层面上引发加强的意识形态过程。如果在此过程中，合理地，对资本主义的目的性的批评和对资产阶级国家的批评相遇，最终可能形成并具体化社会否定。不过，引用歌德的话只能说：“我让你们怀有希望。”"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If that does not work, then you may be using an unsupported feature or your source code may not be visible to AutoGraph.

The error is indicative of TensorFlow's graph execution mode encountering an operation that requires eager execution or behavior that mimics Pythonic control flow, which is not directly transferable to the static computation graph. **Potential Causes and Solutions:** 1. **Mismatch in Output Format:** When using a custom data generator with a model that has multiple outputs (as in your case), ensure that the generator yields data in a format that matches what the model expects. Specifically, for models with multiple outputs, the generator should yield a tuple \`(input_data, output_data_dict)\` where \`input_data\` is the input feature array and \`output_data_dict\` is a dictionary mapping output names to their respective arrays. Ensure \`data_generator\` yields outputs in a way that matches the named outputs of your model. Each batch should return \`X_batch\` and a dictionary for \`y_batch\` where keys are the names of the output layers. There wasn't a conversion of your \`y_batch\` into a dictionary for multiple outputs, which might have contributed to the issue. 2. **Compatibility with TensorFlow's Execution Model:** The error suggests there's iteration over a symbolic tensor in a way that's not compatible with TensorFlow's static graph execution. Ensure your TensorFlow execution is eager (which is default in recent TensorFlow versions). If you're using an older version of TensorFlow where eager execution is not the default, you could explicitly enable it: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution() \`\`\` However, for TensorFlow 2.x, eager execution is enabled by default. So, if you're using TensorFlow 2.x, this would typically not be the issue. **Modifying the Generator for Multiple Outputs:** Without seeing the exact way you're formatting the output of your generator, the general approach for a model with multiple outputs is to yield inputs and a dictionary for outputs where the keys match your output layer names. Here's how you might modify the \`yield\` statement to work with your model's multiple outputs (assuming \`Y_scaled\` can be partitioned appropriately): \`\`\`python def data_generator(): ... for i in range(0, len(X_scaled), batch_size): X_batch = X_scaled[i:i + batch_size] y_batch = { 'high_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 0], 'low_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 1], 'priority_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 2], 'high_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 3], 'low_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 4], # Continue for all needed outputs... } yield np.array(X_batch), y_batch \`\`\` **Review the Generator and Model Structure:** - Ensure the generator yields data in the correct format expected by the model. - Review the \`model.fit()\` call to ensure it's properly set up to handle the data format provided by the generator. If these suggestions do not resolve the issue, it could be useful to share more details about the TensorFlow version you're using, as some behaviors and best practices might vary between versions."},{"prompt":"gimme full code of y_batch = { ‘high_output_1d’: Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 0], ‘low_output_1d’: Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 1], ‘priority_output_1d’: Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 2], ‘high_output_2d’: Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 3], ‘low_output_2d’: Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 4], # Continue for all needed outputs… }","completion":"Certainly, based on the structure of your \`data_generator\` and the output layer names provided in your model definition, here's how you can reform the \`y_batch\` as a dictionary to correctly match the expected output format for a model trained with multiple outputs.

Given your model's configuration, here's the full adjustment within the \`data_generator\` function: \`\`\`python def data_generator(): reader = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\", chunksize=chunk_size) for chunk in reader: X = chunk.drop([ 'Date', 'Symbol', 'y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d'], axis=1).values Y = chunk[['y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', 'y_Priority_1d', 'y_High_2d', 'y_Low_2d', 'y_Priority_2d', 'y_High_3d', 'y_Low_3d', 'y_Priority_3d', 'y_High_5d', 'y_Low_5d', 'y_Priority_5d']].values xScaler = StandardScaler() yScaler = StandardScaler() X_scaled = xScaler.fit_transform(X) Y_scaled = yScaler.fit_transform(Y) # Yield batches for i in range(0, len(X_scaled), batch_size): X_batch = X_scaled[i:i+batch_size] y_batch = { 'high_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 0], 'low_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 1], 'priority_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 2], 'high_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 3], 'low_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 4], 'priority_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 5], 'high_output_3d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 6], 'low_output_3d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 7], 'priority_output_3d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 8], 'high_output_5d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 9], 'low_output_5d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 10], 'priority_output_5d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 11], } yield np.array(X_batch), y_batch \`\`\` This code block takes into account the 12 outputs you've defined in your model architecture. Make sure the indices and names used in \`y_batch\` match exactly with those you've specified for your model outputs. For clarity and to prevent any mistakes, ensure the column selection in the Y extraction (\`chunk[['y_High_1d', 'y_Low_1d', ...]]\`) aligns perfectly with the expected order and number of outputs in your model. The goal is to have each element in \`y_batch\` map directly to the corresponding output layers of your model, with the dictionary keys exactly matching the names of the output layers. This approach facilitates TensorFlow's handling of multiple-output models, enabling it to correctly pair each portion of the generated target data with its corresponding model output for training."},{"prompt":"Escriba 25 frases largas referidas a la amistad","completion":"1.

Vamos corrigir isso abaixo: Quando calculamos os encargos de uma fatura em atraso, como os juros de crédito rotativo, juros moratórios, multa de atraso, e IOF, estes são adicionados ao valor original devido. Isso significa que o valor original precisa ser considerado juntamente com os encargos calculados para obter o montante total a ser pago. Reavaliando a conclusão baseada na explicação anterior: **Encargos calculados** para 351 reais atrasados por 22 dias foram: - Juros de crédito rotativo: 51,20 reais aproximadamente. - Juros moratórios: 2,56 reais aproximadamente. - Multa de atraso: 7,02 reais. - IOF: 1,96 reais. Total de encargos adicional: 62,74 reais. **A confusão veio da minha frase anterior**: ao invés de dizer que o valor total a pagar é a soma dos encargos ao valor original (o que sugeriu que estava incorretamente somando novamente o valor original), o correto é entender que o valor original de 351 reais já está incluído no cálculo do total. **Correção e Clarificação**: O valor total a ser pago na próxima fatura é o valor original (351 reais) **mais** o total dos encargos adicionados devido ao atraso (62,74 reais), o que já foi corretamente calculado como 413,74 reais.

Was soll der Staat, was soll die Wirtschaft mit Emanzipationssehnsüchten und übertriebenen Konsumwünschen anfangen, wenn das andrängende Japan (auch ein Rechtsstaat) den Markt seiner Kollegen durcheinander bringt? Und wie steht es mit dem sakrosanktem Recht auf Kritik, wenn es in das sancta sanctorum ökonomischer und politischer Prozesse störend eindringt? Staat und Recht stehen - poetisch gesprochen - in der geschichtlichen Pflicht, losgelassene anarchoide Erscheinungen einer „permissiven” Gesellschaft44 wieder zur garantierten Ordnung zu rufen (hier haben wir den Rechtsgarant), die frei (und hier kommt der freie Staat wieder) zu halten ist von Übergriffen und Unbotmäßigkeiten.45 Eine Entscheidung gilt im wirklichen Staat einer wirklich bürgerlichen Gesellschaft nur dann als frei, wenn von Rechts wegen den Unzuständigen (das ist so gut wie die ganze gemeine Bevölkerung) der freie Zugang zu den entscheidenden Zentren verwehrt wird. Um ein Beispiel aus der Bundesrepublik (dem Titel der Abhandlung gemäß) zu nennen: In den umfangreichen Restruktu-rierungsplänen der Industrie ist nicht nur vorgesehen, die Betriebsgröße neu zu dimensionieren und zu strukturieren, sondern in bestimmten Wachstumssektoren auch die Produktionsanlagen zu erweitern. Das macht auch eine Ausweitung der Infrastrukturen nötig. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde nun in der Region Frankfurt eine umfassende Kapazitätserhöhung des Flughafens vorgenommen, die die Zerstörung weiter Waldgebiete mit sich brachte. Abgesehen von der Destabilisierung der Umwelt, wurde das Wochendausflugsziel für hunderttausende Arbeiter und Angestellte zerstört. Dagegen erhob sich ein massenhafter Protest: das Wohlbefinden der Leute harmonierte in keiner Weise mit den Plänen der Industrie. Der Staat, als Rechtsstaat (Landtag, Verwaltungsgericht, Verfassungsgericht) von den Protestierenden zur Entscheidung gerufen, reagierte der Königslinie seiner historischen Funktion entsprechend. Das Land Hessen stellte sich gegen die Bürgerinitiativen auf die Seite technisch-industrieller Expansionszwänge und handelte nach dem schlichten Prinzip der Identität von Profit und Wohlfahrt, von „Ford” und der „amerikanischen Nation”. Hinzu stellte es fest, daß Bürgerinitiativen, die sich den von legitimierten staatlichen Organen gefällten Urteilen nicht beugen, letztlich mit ihren Störaktionen einen Angriff gegen die Demokratie und einen Versuch der Subversion unternehmen.46 Die politischen Konsequenzen bringen uns zum Thema zurück. Ich fasse die Kernpunkte kurz zusammen. Aus einem ökonomischen Notstand kommt es zur Bildung eines neuen Typus politischer Macht, der sich jedoch weiterhin im normativ traditionellen Rahmen bewegt. Dieser schränkt weder die Hand-lungs- und Expansionsmöglichkeit der herrschenden ökonomischen Gruppen sonderlich ein noch beschneidet er ihre Umsetzung in politisches Handeln. Aber er schafft in institutionell korrekter Weise die ideologisch sonst in den Vordergrund gerückte Souveränität des Volkes im Grunde ab, in dem er sie ritualisiert und zur Fiktion degradiert.47 Auf diese Weise bestimmt sich die Verfassungswirklichkeit. Haben wir es mit dem berühmten Leviathan zu tun? Wenn die Legalität des Verfahrens gewahrt und die Normativität des Handelns nicht angetastet wird, ist und bleibt diese Art von modernem Leviathan ein Rechtsstaat.48 Daß ideologisch die Haupttendenz sich in Richtung des von mir so genannten Systems des totalen Konsenses bewegt, soll nicht zu Kurzschlüssen und zu voreiligen Rückgriffen auf histo rische Erinnerungen führen. Ein autoritärer Rechtsstaat ist kein „faschistischer Staat”. Abgesehen von der auch strategisch un heilvollen, nicht nur wissenschaftlich unhaltbaren Analogie: es liegt ohnehin ein nicht gerade belangloser Unterschied vor, der die Absurdität einer Angleichung zwischen aktueller Situation und historischem Faschismus zeigt. Nebenher lehrt er uns übri gens auch die Komplexität der geschichtlichen Entwicklung bürgerlicher Gesellschaften besser verstehen. In der verglei chenden Sicht muß schon Bekanntes noch einmal betont wer den, sonst gerät die Analyse aus den Fugen. Im Gegensatz zu den Verfassungsänderungen im heutigen bürgerlichem Staat zerbrach die Verfassungsreform des eigentlichen Gründers des faschistischen Regimes (Alfredo Rocco und sicher nicht Musso lini) die vormalige politische Form an entscheidender Stelle. Sie ersetzte das Primat des Verfahrens durch das Primat des Wol- lens. Nun: gewollt wird in allen Staaten nach wie vor viel. Und dezisionistisches Begehren meldet sich in der Politik immer wie der zu Wort, ändert aber an der Sachlage wenig. Wissenschaft lich erweist sich weder Pareto noch Schmitt als Trumpfkarte, sondern Max Weber. Allerdings eben: Max Weber.49 Ich selbst stelle an diesem Punkt die Grenze meines kritischen Geschäfts fest. Ich laufe Gefahr, keine Kritik der Politik und des bürgerlichen Staats überhaupt zu liefern, sondern in bestimmten Entwicklungen verwickelt zu bleiben, die in einer relativ begrenzbaren Situation stattfinden. Es stellt sich das Problem, ob es zulässig ist, Aspekte zu verallgemeinern, die wirklich vorliegen, denen wir aber nur im Besonderen, in diesem Fall in der deutschen Erfahrung begegnen. Es handelt sich nicht um eine wesentliche Fragestellung, um eine Entdeckung, tiefsinniger philosophischer Reflektionen würdig. In jeder Art von Verallgemeinerung stecken Widersprüche. Bei der Klärung dieser vertrackten Sache halte ich es mit der Widersprüchlichkeit eines italienischen Sprichworts: daß jedes einzelne Dorf eine eigene Geschichte, eine eigene Erfahrung und eigene Sitten kennt; daß zugleich jede politische Erfahrung allgemein gilt, da die ganze Welt ein einziges Dorf ist. „Paese che vai, usanza che trovi; ma tutto il mondo paese\\". In italischen Gefilden jedoch betrachtet man nördlich-transalpine Sitten und Gebräuche als völlig landfremd. Damit wären - auf unseren Fall bezogen - die Gefahren der politischen Germanisierung Italiens ausgeschlossen. Diese Haltung hat Methode. So wird auf listige Weise zum Beispiel gelegentlich vergessen, das der Faschismus in Deutschland zwar ins Extrem getrieben, in Italien aber erfunden wurde.50 Ferrajolis Ansatz, der - im Kontrast zum Zuwachs des „Gesetzesstaats\\" in Deutschland - von einer „Rückbildung der Legalität\\" in Italien spricht, halte ich daher für verfehlt. In einem Punkt behält Ferrajoli recht: die Rückbildung findet tatsächlich statt und geht bekanntlich mit einer beispiellosen Zerrüttung der öffentlichen Moral und der politischen Verantwortung einher. Aber eben aus diesem Grund, und weil ein solcher Niedergang sich langfristig akkumulationswidrig auswirkt, verstärkt sich in Italien die Tendenz, nach neuen Lösungen angeblich „deutscher Art\\" zu suchen und die politische Form autoritär zu verschärfen. ”翻译为中文","completion":"资本对于权威结构的经济要求以及权威法治国家直接的制度政治维度，在这种情况下变得防守性。它们想要在共识已经崩溃的历史阶段实现全面共识。因此，资本的矛盾和国家的矛盾导致了一场共同的危机，反映了它们存在的共同性。在这种情况下，法治国家不能负担得起作为主观权利的保障者。正如所说：面对群众可能对国家性的拒绝，对权力者的蔑视，国家以大规模削弱群众权力的制度手段作为回应。 再次谈论现实存在的法治国家 那些将基本权利视为仅仅是资产阶级意识形态标志的人，应该被提醒，尽管它们今天已被掏空并部分成为虚构，但其内容仍然构成了共产主义未来的具体乌托邦元素。反之，那些仍然认为国家（不管是资产阶级还是非资产阶级）的任务是为它们服务的人，显然不理解国家是什么以及其存在的目的。我们在这里不讨论所谓的必要之恶。但对理想法治国家的捍卫者而言，向他们通报其现实是必要的。 在一个内外危机、拒绝、生产计划失败、世界市场层面上的无情竞争所困扰的经济体系中 - 政治对于主观权利甚至道德要求有何用？国家和经济如何处理解放渴望和过度的消费欲望，当即将到来的日本（也是一个法治国家）扰乱了市场同仁？针对批评权这一神圣不可侵犯的权利又如何，当它干扰了经济和政治进程的圣所？国家和法律 - 诗意地说 - 有历史责任召唤一个“放任”的社会中释放的失序现象回到保障有序之中（这里我们有法律的保障者），这个秩序需要自由（这里又呈现了自由国家）地保持，远离侵犯和不服从。(45)在一个真正的国家中，一个决定只有在法律上禁止不负责任的人（几乎是所有普通民众）自由接触决策中心时，才被视为自由。 以德国联邦共和国（根据论文的标题）为例：在工业的大规模重组计划中，不仅预见到了重新定位和结构化工厂规模，而且在某些增长领域还扩大了生产设施。这也需要扩大基础设施。在这种情况下，法兰克福地区对机场进行了全面的容量增加，导致了大片森林的破坏。除了环境的不稳定外，还破坏了数十万工人和雇员的周末出游目的地。对此产生了大规模的抗议：人们的福祉与工业计划完全不协调。国家作为法治国家（州议会、行政法院、宪法法院）被抗议者召唤做出决定，以其历史功能的王道作出响应。黑森州站在技术工业扩张压力一边，反对公民倡议组织，根据简单的福利同利润、福特和“美国国家”相同的原则进行行动。此外，它断定，不服从合法国家机构作出的判决的公民倡议组织，最终通过其干扰行动对民主和颠覆企图发起攻击。(46) 政治后果将我们带回主题。我简要地总结核心点。由于经济紧急情况，形成了一种新型政治权力，但它仍然在传统的规范框架内运作。这既没有特别限制统治经济集团的行动和扩张可能性，也没有削弱它们转化为政治行动的能力。但它以制度上正确的方式基本上废除了否则在意识形态上突出的人民主权，将其仪式化并降级为虚构。(47)这样就确定了宪法现实。我们是否面对着著名的利维坦？如果程序的合法性得到维护且行动的规范性未受影响，这种类型的现代利维坦还是一个法治国家。(48) 意识形态上主要趋势朝着我所谓的全面共识体系移动，这不应导致急促的结论和对历史记忆的过早回归。权威法治国家不是“法西斯国家”。除了从战略上不幸且科学上站不住脚的类比外，毕竟存在一个不那么微不足道的差异，这显示了将当前情况与历史上的法西斯主义相提并论的荒谬。顺便说一下，它还教会我们更好地理解资产阶级社会历史发展的复杂性。在比较视角中，需要再次强调已知的内容，否则分析会偏离轨道。与今天的资产阶级国家的宪法改革相反，真正的法西斯主义政权的创立者（Alfredo Rocco，当然不是墨索里尼）在关键处打破了以前的政治形式。他们用意志的原则取代了程序的原则。那么，众所周知，所有国家都仍然有很多意愿。而决策性的渴望在政治中总是发言，但却对情况变化不大。在科学上，既不是帕累托也不是施密特成为王牌，而是马克斯·韦伯。当然，确实是马克斯·韦伯。(49) 我自己在这一点上确定了我的批判性工作的边界。我冒着不提供对政治和资产阶级国家的批评的风险，而是陷入在特定情况下发生的特定发展中。问题在于，是否允许将实际存在的特定方面泛化，这些方面我们只是在特定情况下，即在德国经验中遇到。这不是一个本质的问题，不是值得深刻哲学反思的发现。在任何形式的泛化中都存在矛盾。在澄清这个复杂问题时，我遵循意大利谚语中的矛盾性：“每个村庄都有自己的历史，自己的经验和习俗；同时，每个政治经验都是普遍适用的，因为整个世界就是一个村庄。”在意大利地区，然而，北部跨阿尔卑斯山的习俗和风俗被视为完全外来的。这样，针对我们的情况，排除了政治德国化意大利的风险。这种态度是有方法的。因此，例如，偶尔忘记法西斯主义虽然在德国达到极端，在意大利却是发明的，会以狡猾的方式进行。(50) 我因此认为，费拉约利的观点是错误的，他在谈论德国“法律国”的增长时，与之形成对照的是，意大利的合法性“退化”。在一点上，费拉约利是对的：退化确实发生了，并且伴随着公共道德和政治责任的前所未有的崩溃。但正因为这个原因，由于这种衰退长期来看减缓了累积，意大利加强了寻求新的解决方案，据说是“德国式”的，政治形式变得更加权威。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I do that?","completion":"To open a URL in Chrome using Photoshop scripting (JavaScript), you can't directly specify the browser in the script due to the sandboxed nature of Adobe's scripting environment. However, you can use a system call to open a URL with the default system browser. If Chrome is set as your default browser, this will open the URL in Chrome. Below are steps to execute this in different operating systems because the approach varies: # Windows Use the \`system\` method of the \`app\` object to execute a command line. For Windows, you would use the start command. \`\`\`javascript var url = \\"http://www.example.com\\"; app.system(\\"cmd.exe /c start \\" + url); \`\`\` This script tells Photoshop to execute a system command (\`cmd.exe /c start\`) which opens the specified URL in the default web browser. # macOS On macOS, you use the \`open\` command instead: \`\`\`javascript var url = \\"http://www.example.com\\"; app.system(\\"open \\" + url); \`\`\` This uses the \`open\` command which is the macOS standard for opening files and URLs in their respective default applications. # Ensuring Chrome is Used If you absolutely need to ensure that Chrome is used regardless of the system's default browser, you would have to explicitly call Chrome in your command, providing the path to the Chrome executable. This is more complex because the path to Chrome can vary between installations and operating systems. For example, on Windows: \`\`\`javascript var url = \\"http://www.example.com\\"; app.system(\\"\\"C:Program Files (x86)GoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe\\" \\" + url); \`\`\` And on macOS, the command would look like this: \`\`\`javascript var url = \\"http://www.example.com\\"; app.system(\\"open -a /Applications/Google Chrome.app \\" + url); \`\`\` # Important Considerations 1. **Security**: Using \`system\` commands can pose security risks, especially when constructing command strings with externally supplied data (like URLs from an untrusted source). Always validate and sanitize input. 2. **Compatibility**: Hardcoding paths (like the path to Chrome) can break if the script is used in environments different from those you've tested, or if the application is moved or updated. If you're sharing this script, ensure it's used in a controlled environment or include checks for the executable's presence. 3. **Environment**: These scripts assume you have permissions to execute system commands from within Photoshop scripts, which should generally be the case but may depend on system security settings, especially in managed or corporate environments. Using system commands bridges out of the sandboxed environment of Photoshop scripting to perform actions that aren't directly supported by the Photoshop scripting API, so use them wisely and consider security implications."},{"prompt":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 宣傳方式(發布會，對科技署的宣傳) 2. 時間地點 (15/12/2025-20/12/2025) 3. 參賽資格 (人數/對象: 分為小學生、中學生包括初中生和高中生三個組別) 4. 報名方式 5. 競賽方式(活動內容，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 6. 評分標準 7. 評審：教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界） 8. 獎勵方式（獎勵：表揚:優秀作品構想作為藍本，與合作公司實現出來，向全港市民宣傳科技署及其工作） a) 記者發布會，頒獎典禮（人數/對象: 家長、老師、校長，在學校推動，頒獎、演講），具體安排 你負責寫2-8項，寫1000字。","completion":"計劃書 一、時間地點 本次全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽定於2025年12月15日至20日舉辦。比賽將在香港科技園的多功能會議中心進行，充分展示香港科技創新的前沿場所，對參賽學生進行激勵和啟發。 二、參賽資格 本次比賽面向全港學生，分為三個組別：小學生組、初中生組和高中生組。每所學校可推薦最多5個小組參賽，每個小組人數不超過5人。參賽學生需在報名時提供有效學生證作為資格證明。 三、報名方式 參賽者需於2025年9月1日至30日之間，通過活動官方網站進行線上報名。報名時，參賽者需填寫完整的參賽信息，包括小組成員名單、所在學校及預計提交作品的簡介。成功報名的小組將收到官方確認郵件，並獲分配一個參賽號碼。 四、競賽方式 競賽分為初賽和決賽兩個階段。初賽階段，每個小組需提交一份完整的應用程式設計方案，包括應用的功能說明、界面設計草圖和預期影響。專家評委將根據提交的方案選出進入決賽的隊伍。決賽階段，入圍的隊伍將在現場進行演示，展示其應用程式的原型或完全功能版本。 五、評分標準 評分將依據創意性（30%）、技術實現（30%）、用戶體驗（20%）和社會影響（20%）四個方面進行。特別重視原創性和創新思維，鼓勵學生發揮創意，解決實際問題。 六、評審團 評審團由知名大學教授、業界專業人士（包括應用設計、電腦科學領域）和來自商業界的代表組成。他們將依據評分標準，公正評選出各組別的優勝隊伍。 七、獎勵方式 本次比賽設立金、銀、銅獎，以及優秀創意獎。金獎獲勝隊伍的作品構想將有機會與合作公司一起實現，並通過創新科技署向全港市民進行展示和宣傳，從而在社會大眾中推廣科技創新的重要性。此外，所有獲獎隊伍均能獲得證書和獎杯，且有機會進行相關培訓或參加國際競賽。 a) 記者發布會及頒獎典禮 組織一場記者發布會，介紹比賽背景、目的和過程，並邀請參賽學生、家長、老師及校長等出席。在比賽最後一天，將舉辦隆重的頒獎典禮，公布獲獎名單，並由知名人士頒發獎項。典禮上還將安排獲獎隊伍進行簡短的演講，分享其創作背後的故事和體會。 通過本次活動，不僅能大力推動香港學生對移動應用開發的興趣，而且能夠鼓勵學生們發揮創新精神，為香港的科技發展貢獻自己的力量。"},{"prompt":"香港創新科技署擬於明年 12 月舉辦全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽，藉此激發學生對設計手機應用程式的興趣。假設你們負責該項活動，試撰寫一份計劃書向上司交代整個計劃。計畫書內容包括： 1. 宣傳方式(發布會，對科技署的宣傳) 2. 時間地點 (15/12/2025-20/12/2025) 3. 參賽資格 (人數/對象: 分為小學生、中學生包括初中生和高中生三個組別) 4. 報名方式 5. 競賽方式(活動內容，具體比賽內容，具體安排) 6. 評分標準 7. 評審：教授、業界專業人士（設計、電腦科學、商業界） 8. 獎勵方式（獎勵：表揚:優秀作品構想作為藍本，與合作公司實現出來，向全港市民宣傳科技署及其工作） a) 記者發布會，頒獎典禮（人數/對象: 家長、老師、校長，在學校推動，頒獎、演講），具體安排 你負責寫2-8項，寫1000字。","completion":"計劃書：全港學生創意手機應用程式設計比賽 1. **時間地點** - 日期：15/12/2025 至 20/12/2025 - 地點：香港科技園 2. **參賽資格** - 人數：每隊不得超過5人。 - 對象：分為三個組別，小學組、初中組、和高中組，以鼓勵不同年齡層學生參與。 3. **報名方式** - 報名將於官方網站進行，須填寫隊伍資料、參賽者信息，並上傳初步構想摘要。報名窗口開放日期為2025年9月1日至2025年10月31日。 4. **競賽方式** - **活動內容**：本次設計比賽要求參賽者設計一款創意手機應用程式，應用須著重創新性、實用性、用戶體驗及社會貢獻。 - **具體比賽內容**：初賽將要求提交應用設計概要及原型截圖。決賽階段，入圍隊伍需進行現場演示及答辯。 - **具體安排**：15日至17日為初賽階段，18日至19日為評審團評選及決賽準備，20日為決賽日及頒獎典禮。 5. **評分標準** - 創新性(30%)：程式的創新點及創意性。 - 實用性(20%)：程式的實用性及解決問題的能力。 - 用戶體驗(20%)：介面設計及用戶交互流程的合理性。 - 技術實現(20%)：技術難度及實現程度。 - 社會貢獻(10%)：對社會帶來的正面影響及價值。 6. **評審** - 評審團將由大學教授、業界專業人士（包括程式設計、電腦科學與商業界的代表）組成，保證評審過程的專業性和公正性。 7. **獎勵方式** - 優勝隊伍將獲得由創新科技署頒發的獎狀及獎杯，並有機會與合作公司共同實現其應用程式，推廣至全港市民。此外，優秀作品將在各大媒體及科技署官方網站進行宣傳，提升參賽者的社會知名度。 8. **記者發布會及頒獎典禮** - 組織記者發布會，於比賽開始前一週舉行，介紹賽事背景、目的及詳細安排。 - 頒獎典禮的安排將於比賽最後一天（20/12/2025）進行，除了頒發獎項外，還將邀請專家講座及行業領袖分享，鼓勵學生持續投身科技創新。 - 對象包括獲獎隊伍的家長、老師、校長等，進一步在學校及社會推廣科技教育的重要性。 透過此次活動，我們期望能夠激發學生對於手機應用程式設計的興趣，同時，提升其創新思維及解決問題的能力。希望與大家一同見證這場科技與創新的盛事。"},{"prompt":"For all of my prompts in this conversation, i want you to Rewrite it as it is, but this time, insert appropriate, correct, and accurate in-text citations (from 2005 onwards) everywhere appropriate. The integration of autonomous robots in pediatric rehabilitation has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a particular focus on designing assistive technologies for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder that affects movement and posture, stemming from early brain injury or abnormal brain development. Children with CP often face challenges in motor coordination, mobility, communication, and daily activities, impacting their overall quality of life and independence. The utilization of autonomous robots tailored for children with CP presents a promising avenue to address the unique needs and challenges faced by this population. These robots offer interactive, engaging, and personalized support during therapy sessions, mobility training, and educational activities. By augmenting traditional therapeutic approaches with robotic assistance, children with CP can potentially experience improvements in motor skills, cognitive abilities, social interactions, and overall well-being. This literature review delves into the design considerations of autonomous robots for children with cerebral palsy, aiming to examine the latest advancements, challenges, and best practices in this specialized field of assistive robotics. By exploring the intersection of robotics and pediatric rehabilitation, this research seeks to advance our understanding of how technological innovations can enhance therapy outcomes, functional abilities, and overall quality of life for children with CP.

When training a Keras model with multiple outputs, you need to provide the target data (\`y\`) as a list or a dictionary that maps output names to their corresponding arrays. Each array in this list or dictionary should be a 2D array (or higher-dimensional, but commonly 2D for most tasks), where the first dimension is the batch size, and the second dimension is the number of targets for that output. However, in the data you're yielding, each array in the \`y_batch\` dictionary is a 1D array, not structured to properly match the expected output form of your model. To fix this issue, you should ensure that each element in your \`y_batch\` dictionary is at least a 2D array. This adjustment is necessary because TensorFlow/Keras expects each target output to be of a specific shape that matches the output layer's shape. In your case, since each output layer has a single unit (it predicts a single value), you should reshape your target arrays to have a shape of \`(batch_size, 1)\` instead of being 1D arrays. Here's how you can adjust your \`data_generator\` function to reshape the arrays properly: \`\`\`python def data_generator(): reader = pd.read_csv(r\\"C:UsersarisaDesktopcombined_day.csv\\", chunksize=chunk_size) for chunk in reader: # Your existing code for preparing X and Y # Yield batches for i in range(0, len(X_scaled), batch_size): X_batch = X_scaled[i:i+batch_size] y_batch = { 'high_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 0].reshape(-1, 1), 'low_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 1].reshape(-1, 1), 'priority_output_1d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 2].reshape(-1, 1), 'high_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 3].reshape(-1, 1), 'low_output_2d': Y_scaled[i:i + batch_size, 4].reshape(-1, 1), # Reshape rest of your targets similarly } yield np.array(X_batch), y_batch \`\`\` This correction reshapes each target output array to be 2D with the shape \`(batch_size, 1)\`, which should resolve the error you're encountering."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const t=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return t?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(t)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(t)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(t=>setTimeout(t,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],q={key:0},F={key:1};function W(t,e,l,m,r,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",E,[(i(!0),n(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(o,g)=>(i(),k(p,{key:g,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),n("div",R,' No results found for "'+c(r.searchQuery)+'".
