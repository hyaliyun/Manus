I still do not know what that means?","completion":"In discussing the shape of the universe, cosmologists often explore different geometries that the universe could exhibit. One of the possible shapes is called a \\"3-torus\\" or \\"three-dimensional torus.\\" To understand a 3-torus, let's start with lower dimensions: - A 1-dimensional torus can be thought of as a circle. It is simple: you move in one direction, and eventually, you end up where you started. - A 2-dimensional torus is a doughnut (toroid) shape. If you live on a 2D surface like the surface of a doughnut, and you move in a straight line in either the direction around the hole or the direction around the doughnut's main body, you would eventually return to your starting point, having traversed the entire surface. Now, a 3-dimensional torus (or 3-torus) is a bit harder to visualize because it involves a third dimension wrapped around itself in a similar way. Just as a 2D being on a 2D torus would come back to the same point by traveling in a straight line, in a 3-torus universe, you could start moving in any of the three spatial dimensions, and if you could go far enough without being obstructed, you would eventually return to your starting point without ever having turned around. This is equivalent to taking a 3D space (like a cube) and \\"gluing\\" opposite faces together. If you go out through the right-hand side, you'd reappear on the left-hand side. If you go off the top, you'd appear at the bottom. If you move forward through the front face, you re-enter through the back face. A 3-torus topology for our universe is one of the possible solutions for the shape of the universe according to general relativity, and it implies a finite but unbounded universe. This means that while the universe has a finite volume, there are no edges or boundaries; it wraps around itself. You would never actually encounter a physical boundary, but the universe would not be infinitely extending either. It's important to note that this is purely a topological description of the universe and that it's one of several models being considered by cosmologists.

List复制：虽然你用\`res.addAll(dataList);\`创建了一个新的\`ArrayList\`，但是实际复制的是引用的列表。这意味着\`res\`和\`dataList\`中的元素在物理上是相同的\`Map\`对象。因此，当你在\`res\`中的\`Map\`对象上进行操作时，实际上是在原始\`dataList\`中的对应\`Map\`对象上操作。 2. 引用数据类型：在Java中，\`Map\`是一个引用数据类型。当你对任何变量或集合里的\`Map\`做改动时，你实际上是在操作那个内存空间指向的实际对象。因此，即使是在不同的线程中，如果两个线程持有指向同一个\`Map\`对象的引用，其中一个线程对\`Map\`做出的改动将对另一个线程可见。 如果你希望在异步执行的方法中对集合进行操作而不影响原始的集合，你需要做一个深复制(deep copy)，意味着你需要创建集合中**每个元素的副本**。这可以通过遍历原始集合，对每个元素创建副本并添加到新集合中来完成。 例如： \`\`\`java List<Map<String, Object>> res = new ArrayList<>(); for(Map<String, Object> originalItem : dataList) { Map<String, Object> copy = new HashMap<>(originalItem); // 创建每个元素的副本 copy.remove(\\"channelDataVoList\\"); // 对副本进行操作 res.add(copy); } \`\`\` 现在，\`res\`包含了\`dataList\`的每个元素的副本，你可以在异步方法中自由地操作这些副本，无需担心会改变主线程中\`dataList\`中的元素。"},{"prompt":"java中， restful 风格的api 是什么样的？","completion":"RESTful API，即Representational State Transfer（表现层状态转化）风格的API，是指按照REST架构风格设计的网络应用程序接口。REST是一种软件架构风格，它侧重于网络应用的可伸缩性和互操作性，提倡无状态通信和资源的表现层状态转换。 在RESTful API中，资源（Resource）的概念是核心。资源可以是任何可以被命名的事物，比如文档、图片、服务中的实体等。资源通过URL（统一资源定位符）进行唯一标识。 RESTful API通常使用HTTP方法来表达对资源的操作，包括： - **GET**：用于检索资源的表示。GET请求应该是幂等的，不改变资源的状态。 - **POST**：用于创建新的资源。通常，POST请求会在服务器上创建或更新资源。 - **PUT**：用于更新现有资源的全部内容或创建一个新的资源。 - **PATCH**：用于更新现有资源的部分内容。 - **DELETE**：用于删除资源。 RESTful API设计的一些关键原则包括： 1. **无状态（Stateless）**：服务器不会保存任何客户端的上下文信息，每个请求都包含了处理该请求所需的全部信息。服务器可以存储请求的状态，但是在请求之间不应该维护客户端的状态。 2. **客户端-服务器（Client-Server）**：客户端和服务器之间的交互是松耦合的，客户端不需要知道业务逻辑，服务器也不需要知道用户界面逻辑。 3. **可缓存（Cacheable）**：资源的表示可以被缓存以提高网络效率。将资源和操作标记为可缓存或不可缓存。 4. **统一接口（Uniform Interface）**：定义了客户端如何与服务器进行交云，包括使用标准化的HTTP方法和媒体类型。 5. **分层系统（Layered System）**：客户端通常不知道它是否直接连接到最终服务器，或者通过中间层。每一层都可以添加额外的安全措施或负载均衡。 RESTful API的一个例子： \`\`\`http # 获取用户列表 GET /api/users # 获取单个用户 GET /api/users/123 # 创建一个新用户 POST /api/users # 更新用户信息 PUT /api/users/123 # 部分更新用户信息 PATCH /api/users/123 # 删除用户 DELETE /api/users/123 \`\`\` 以上是用户实体相关的操作，通过不同的HTTP方法和路径来标识不同的动作和资源。这种风格使得API易于理解和使用，同时也便于标准化和拓展。"},{"prompt":"navicat中，建立postgres数据库的连接报错，endpoint id is not specified","completion":"Navicat 报告 \\"endpoint id is not specified\\" 错误时，可能是由于在连接配置过程中遗漏了某些关键信息，或者配置不正确导致的。以下是建立 PostgreSQL 数据库连接的常见步骤和可能出现的问题： 1. **打开 Navicat**：打开 Navicat 应用程序。 2. **创建新连接**：点击工具栏上的“新建连接”按钮，然后选择“PostgreSQL”。 3. **配置连接信息**： - **连接名称**：为你的连接输入一个名称。 - **主机**：输入 PostgreSQL 服务器的 IP 地址或主机名。 - **端口**：输入 PostgreSQL 服务的端口，默认端口是 5432。 - **用户名称**：输入具有数据库访问权限的 PostgreSQL 用户名。 - **密码**：输入用户的密码。 4. **保存并测试连接**：保存你的设置，并尝试测试连接以确认所有信息无误。 如果你在配置连接时遇到了 \\"endpoint id is not specified\\" 这个错误信息，建议按照以下步骤排查问题： - **检查主机和端口**：确保你提供的是正确的主机地址和端口号。如果你使用的是云数据库服务，确保已经正确地配置了网络安全组规则或防火墙以允许 Navicat 访问。 - **检查数据库实例 ID**：如果你使用的是云服务提供的 PostgreSQL，确保在连接信息中包含了必要的数据库实例 ID 或其它识别信息。 - **使用标准连接方式**：如果 Navicat 提供了多种连接选项，例如标准、SSL、SSH 等，确保选择了适当的连接方式。 - **检查数据库用户权限**：确保你使用的数据库用户拥有足够的权限访问数据库，且没有受到IP地址或其他访问限制。 - **检查 SSL 设置**：如果你的 PostgreSQL 数据库需要 SSL 连接，确保你在 Navicat 的连接配置中启用了 SSL，并且正确地配置了 SSL 证书文件（如果需要）。 - **升级 Navicat**：如果你使用的是旧版本的 Navicat，请尝试更新到最新版本，以确保兼容性和安全性。 如果以上步骤都无法解决问题，建议查看 Navicat 的错误日志或联系 Navicat 的技术支持来进一步诊断问题。同时，确保你的 PostgreSQL 服务器是可以被访问的，比如没有网络隔离或服务未运行。"},{"prompt":"postgres数据库的url是\\"postgres://default:<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>:5432/verceldb\\"，我应该如何在navicat建立连接？","completion":"根据你提供的 PostgreSQL 数据库 URL，你可以按照以下步骤在 Navicat 中建立连接： 1. **打开 Navicat**：启动你的 Navicat 应用程序。 2. **创建新连接**：点击工具栏上的“连接”或“新建连接”按钮，然后选择“PostgreSQL”作为数据库类型。 3. **配置连接信息**：在新建连接的弹出窗口中输入以下信息： - **连接名称**：输入一个你选择的连接名称，这个不影响实际的连接，仅是为了在Navicat中标记。 - **主机名称/IP 地址**：这里是数据库的主机地址，对应你提供的 URL 中的 \`ep-steep-brook-06184564.us-east-1.postgres.vercel-storage.com\`。 - **端口**：PostgreSQL的默认端口是 5432，这已经在你的 URL 中指定了。 - **用户名称**：根据你提供的URL，用户名是 \`default\`。 - **密码**：密码是 \`aaabbbccc\`。 - **初始数据库**：这是你要连接的数据库名称，在你的URL中是\`verceldb\`。 4. **测试连接**：在填写完所有信息后，点击“测试连接”以确保所有参数都正确无误并且你的电脑可以连接到该PostgreSQL服务器。 5. **保存连接**：如果测试连接成功，那么你可以点击“确定”或“保存”来保存连接设置。 连接的配置界面应类似于以下内容： - **连接名称**：任意名称，如 VercelDB - **主机**：ep-steep-brook-06184564.us-east-1.postgres.vercel-storage.com - **端口**：5432 - **用户名称**：default - **密码**：aaabbbccc - **数据库**：verceldb 请记得，根据你的网络环境，你可能还需要进行额外的网络配置，比如配置防火墙或VPN，以确保可以成功连接到远端的数据库。 如果依然无法连接，请检查是否有网络防火墙、安全组设置或其他可能阻止外部连接的问题。另外，可能需要检查你所使用的PostgreSQL是否需要使用SSL连接，如果需要，则在Navicat的SSL设置中相应配置。"},{"prompt":"报错提示Endpoint ID is not specified","completion":"在提供的 PostgreSQL 数据库 URL 中包含了所需的所有信息，但是如果你在建立连接时收到错误 \\"Endpoint ID is not specified\\"，这通常意味着 Navicat 或连接配置缺少一些必要的信息或受到了其他约束。 由于这不是一个常见的错误信息，推测可能和 Navicat 版本或所连接服务的特定要求有关。以下是一些可能的解决措施： 1. **检查 Navicat 的版本**：确保你使用的 Navicat 版本是最新的。如果不是，尝试升级到最新版本。 2. **核对 URL 细节**：重新检查你提供的连接信息，确保没有错字或遗漏。 3. **额外参数**：考虑到错误信息中提到\\"Endpoint ID\\"，这暗示可能有额外的参数需要配置。这可能与 PostgreSQL 服务在特定的云环境中的特殊要求有关，比如需要附加的身份认证或者连接参数。 4. **查阅文档**：由于错误信息提到了一个不是 PostgreSQL 标准连接字符串的参数 (\\"Endpoint ID\\")，请查阅你所使用的 PostgreSQL 服务的文档，确认是否有特殊的连接要求。 5. **联系技术支持**：如果上述方法都不能解决问题，并且确定你填写的连接信息没有错误，那么可能需要联系 Navicat 的技术支持或你的 PostgreSQL 服务提供商的支持来解决问题。 6. **尝试其他工具**：作为一个临时的解决方案或用作参考，你可以尝试使用其他支持 PostgreSQL 的数据库连接工具（如 pgAdmin 或 psql 命令行工具）来测试连接情况。 最后，由于 \\"Endpoint ID is not specified\\" 不是常见的 PostgreSQL 错误信息，如果可能的话请提供更多的上下文信息或者完整的错误消息供进一步分析。"},{"prompt":"how to connect to vercel postgresSQL","completion":"Connecting to a Vercel PostgreSQL database typically involves using standard PostgreSQL connection methods. As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, Vercel managed PostgreSQL databases were not released to the public, so if you are using a managed PostgreSQL database by Vercel, you should refer to their official documentation or support for connection details and any specific instructions. However, if you are using standard PostgreSQL on a server that is deployed through Vercel or using Vercel Secrets to store sensitive information like connection strings, here's how you would generally go about connecting to the PostgreSQL database: # Via Command Line (\`psql\`): 1. Install the \`psql\` command-line tool if you don't already have it. 2. Use the connection string provided by your hosting or DB service to connect using the following format: \`\`\`shell psql \\"postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database\\" \`\`\` Replace \`username\`, \`password\`, \`hostname\`, \`port\`, and \`database\` with your actual credentials. # Via Application Code: If you're connecting from application code, use a PostgreSQL client library suitable for your programming language and pass the connection string or its individual components to the client. For example, in Node.js you might use the \`pg\` module like this: \`\`\`javascript const { Pool } = require('pg'); const connectionString = 'postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database'; const pool = new Pool({ connectionString, }); // Use the pool to query the database \`\`\` Make sure to replace the connection string with the one provided by Vercel or your DB host. # Via GUI Tools (e.g., pgAdmin or DBeaver): 1. Open your preferred GUI tool. 2. Create a new connection/profile. 3. Input the required details which will typically include: - Hostname: The server address where your database is hosted. - Port: The port PostgreSQL is listening on (usually 5432). - Database: The name of the database you want to connect to. - Username: Your PostgreSQL username. - Password: Your PostgreSQL password. # Common Parameters for PostgreSQL Connection Strings: - \`username\`: The database user's username. You might need to URL-encode special characters if they're part of your username or password. - \`password\`: The database user's password. - \`hostname\`: The network location (IP address or domain name) of your PostgreSQL server. - \`port\`: The port number that PostgreSQL is listening on; the default is typically 5432. - \`database\`: The name of the database you want to connect to. Always ensure that your connection is secure, especially if you’re connecting over the internet. Use SSL connections if supported by your PostgreSQL server. Remember, each PostgreSQL client, whether it's a tool, library, or command-line utility, might require slightly different formats or additional parameters for the connection. Always consult the specific tool's documentation for precise connection instructions. If Vercel provides managed PostgreSQL databases, they likely include specific instructions or a dashboard that facilitates connections, along with credentials and potentially pre-configured connection strings."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Merged the conditional checks for \`departure_station\` and \`destination_station\` at the beginning and returned early to avoid any further processing if they aren't present. 2. Removed redundant condition checks, like whether they're present or not, after their values have been set. 3. Removed duplicate operations such as upcase/downcase on parameters as they are only required once. 4. Used \`preload\` instead of \`includes\` to optimize database queries. \`preload\` loads the associated records in a separate query, which can be faster for larger datasets or when the order of the associated records doesn't matter. This reduces the number of queries made by batching them. 5. Reduced memory allocations by using \`each_with_object\` instead of creating temporary arrays and concatenating them. 6. Removed unnecessary \`distinct\` as \`group\` already enforces the uniqueness based on the \`schedules.id\`. 7. Sorts the trips based on the \`departure_time\` directly in the \`sorted_trips\` without the additional step. Just remember that optimizing a code could lead to less readability, but it's often beneficial for performance. Always profile your application's performance with realistic data and scenarios to identify bottlenecks and potential optimizations."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮忙的吗？"},{"prompt":"李善均为什么自杀","completion":"截至我的知识更新日期在2023年之前，韩国演员李善均并没有公开的自杀事件。他是一位知名的韩国演员，以参与多部影视作品如《请回答1988》、《非常声明》和《居家男人》等而著称。 如果你所指的事件发生在我的知识更新日期之后，或者你指的是其他人，请提供更多信息，以便我能为你提供准确的回答。 否则，如果你讨论的是误报或错误的消息，请注意互联网上有时会散布未经证实或虚假的信息，因此在未经官方渠道确认之前，应对此类消息持谨慎态度。如果李善均的状况近期有什么变动，请查阅最新的新闻报道或官方声明获取准确信息。"},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

If so what is it called? What would it be like to live on one?","completion":"A sphere with an infinite area but a finite boundary (circumference in 2D or surface boundary in 3D) does not exist in hyperbolic geometry as it is defined. In hyperbolic geometry, objects can have unusual properties compared to Euclidean geometry, but the notion of a sphere itself is roughly the same as in Euclidean space — it's a set of points that are all the same distance from a central point. However, what you might be referring to are objects with finite volume but an infinite surface area, which do exist in hyperbolic 3-space (H3). An example of this is a hyperbolic 3-manifold that has a finite volume but is non-compact, so its \\"surface\\" is not closed and goes off to infinity. In such a space, you could have regions that are bounded by a surface of infinite area. These are not spheres, though, but more complicated geometric shapes. One example of a shape in hyperbolic geometry with infinite perimeter (in 2D) or surface area (in 3D) but finite volume is the \\"hyperbolic paraboloid,\\" or a \\"saddle shape.\\" These objects can be understood within the context of tessellations of the hyperbolic plane by regular polygons with a sufficiently large number of sides or other suitable geometrical figures. Living on such a shape, if it were somehow a 2D surface or 3D space with Earth-like conditions, would be quite disorienting by Euclidean standards. Among the peculiar aspects: 1. Parallel Lines: Traditional parallel lines as we understand them in Euclidean geometry do not exist in hyperbolic space. Instead, all lines will eventually diverge. 2. Triangle Angles: The angles of a triangle in hyperbolic space always add up to less than 180 degrees. 3. Area and Distance: Shapes can be counterintuitively large. A relatively short fence could enclose a vast area. 4. Curvature: The constant negative curvature of the space would distort perceptions and would make straight-line navigation impossible – you would always be moving in \\"curves\\". 5. Horizons: Depending on the specifics of the geometry, the horizon might look very different from what we're used to — other parts of the surface might curve away from you abruptly. In practical terms, \\"living\\" in a hyperbolic space would require physical laws different from our own, since our universe appears to be well described by Euclidean geometry at human scales and by the curved spacetime of general relativity at astronomical scales, which does not behave like the hyperbolic space of hyperbolic geometry."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I come from a future in which the Horde and Alliance had formed a peace treaty that was ever-lasting in my time. Of course, I was the leader of the nightborne in the future - and they called me \\"Thirteenth Arcanist Meplande\\". I decided that I would take a trip to the past - or as my ancestors called it, the present - to see what my ancestors had accomplished in my time.)","completion":"As I stepped through the time portal, my senses were immediately overwhelmed. The air felt different, filled with a strange combination of anticipation and fear. I looked around and realized that I had arrived in Suramar, my ancestral home, but it was not the city I knew. The streets were crowded with nightborne, rushing about their daily tasks with a sense of urgency. The buildings were intact, but the aura of magic that usually enveloped them was tinged with a sense of desperation. I couldn't help but worry for my people, wondering what had happened to cause such turmoil. Lost in my thoughts, I didn't notice the young nightborne woman approaching me until she spoke. \\"Excuse me, traveler. Are you lost?\\" she asked, concern etched on her face. \\"I... Yes, I suppose I am,\\" I replied, realizing I hadn't accounted for my appearance being different from the natives of this time. \\"I come from the future, and I seek to learn about the history of our people. Can you guide me?\\" The woman's eyes widened in surprise, but she quickly composed herself. \\"Of course, Thirteenth Arcanist Meplande. It would be an honor to assist you. My name is Lyseara.\\" Lyseara led me through the bustling streets, explaining that Suramar was currently in the midst of a rebellion against the rule of Elisande, the current leader. Under her tyrannical reign, my people were enslaved and cut off from the world beyond the city's borders. As we walked, I learned about the resistance movement led by the Nightfallen, a group of nightborne who refused to yield to Elisande's oppressive rule. They fought for the freedom of our people, seeking to reclaim Suramar and establish a new order that was fair and just. Lyseara introduced me to other members of the resistance, each with their own stories of hardship and determination. Their spirit and resilience were awe-inspiring, and I couldn't help but feel a surge of pride for my people. In my future, they would become warriors and heroes. Days turned into weeks as I immersed myself in the rebellion's cause, using my skills as a hunter to aid them in their fight. Together, we infiltrated enemy camps, gathering crucial information and coordinating strikes against Elisande's forces. During one of our missions, we came across a group of nightborne prisoners, weak and malnourished. It hit me then, the true extent of Elisande's cruelty. These were my ancestors, my people, suffering under her rule. I vowed then and there to do everything in my power to free them. As time went on, the resistance grew stronger, gaining momentum and support from the nightborne who had once been too afraid to rise against Elisande. With each victory, we brought hope to our people, showing them that a brighter future was within reach. Finally, the day came when we launched our final assault on the palace. The battle was fierce, but we fought with a determination fueled by years of oppression. As I stood atop the palace battlements, overlooking the city, I knew that history was being rewritten before my eyes. We emerged victorious, and the people of Suramar celebrated their newfound freedom. The city that had once been a prison was now alive with joy and hope. Nightborne of all walks of life gathered in the streets, reveling in the knowledge that they were the masters of their own destiny. My mission in the past was complete, and it was time for me to return to my own time. But as I bid farewell to Lyseara and the Nightfallen, I realized that the journey had changed me. I now knew the strength and resilience of my people, and I carried their spirit with me, even into the future. As Thirteenth Arcanist Meplande, leader of the nightborne, I would continue to fight for justice and freedom, ensuring that the sacrifices made by my ancestors were never in vain."},{"prompt":"Python 如何按照任务优先级顺序执行，j和i都属于集合A，且j优于i，在python中如何表示","completion":"在Python中，可以使用列表和字典来表示任务的优先级，并按照优先级顺序执行任务。 方法一：使用列表来表示任务优先级 可以使用一个列表来存储任务，根据任务的优先级顺序安排任务的顺序。 \`\`\`python tasks = [ {'name': 'j', 'priority': 1}, {'name': 'i', 'priority': 2}, ] sorted_tasks = sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: x['priority']) for task in sorted_tasks: # 执行任务相关的操作 print(task['name']) \`\`\` 方法二：使用字典来表示任务优先级 可以使用一个字典来存储任务，以优先级作为键，任务名作为值，并按照优先级顺序遍历字典的键。 \`\`\`python tasks = { 1: 'j', 2: 'i', } sorted_priorities = sorted(tasks) for priority in sorted_priorities: task = tasks[priority] # 执行任务相关的操作 print(task) \`\`\` 以上两种方法都可以根据任务的优先级顺序执行任务，具体使用哪种方法取决于你的需求和喜好。"},{"prompt":"代码：A={ 1:'j', 2:'i' } sorted_priorities=sorted(A) for priority in sorted_priorities: task = A[priority] for (j,i) in A: # 约束(5) sum_lhs=0 sum_rhs=0 for h in range(k_j): for s in range(num_workstations): sum_lhs += s * x_ihs for h in range(k_i): for s in range(num_workstations): sum_rhs += s * x_ihs model.addConstraint(sum_lhs <= sum_rhs)报错： for (j,i) in A: # 约束(5) ^^^^^ TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable int object","completion":"在你的代码中，\`A\` 是一个字典，遍历字典的键值对时需要使用 \`A.items()\` 或者 \`A.values()\`。同时，代码缩进在 Python 中非常重要，需要保持语句之间的正确缩进。 以下是修正后的代码： \`\`\`python A = { 1: 'j', 2: 'i' } sorted_priorities = sorted(A) for priority in sorted_priorities: task = A[priority] # 约束(5) for (j, i) in A.items(): sum_lhs = 0 sum_rhs = 0 for h in range(k_j): for s in range(num_workstations): sum_lhs += s * x_ihs for h in range(k_i): for s in range(num_workstations): sum_rhs += s * x_ihs model.addConstraint(sum_lhs <= sum_rhs) \`\`\` 请注意，这段代码中的 \`k_j\`、\`k_i\`、\`num_workstations\` 和 \`x_ihs\` 等变量需要根据你的具体情况进行定义和赋值。"},{"prompt":"A={ 'j':{'i'}, 'i':set() }这个代码什么意思","completion":"这段代码定义了一个字典 \`A\`，其中包含两个键值对。每个键都是一个字母代表的任务，值是一个集合，表示与该任务相关的其他任务。这样的数据结构可以用来构建任务关系图，描述任务之间的依赖关系。 具体来说： - \`A['j']\` 的值是一个集合 \`{'i'}\`，表示任务 \`'j'\` 与任务 \`'i'\` 有关联。换句话说，任务 \`'j'\` 依赖于任务 \`'i'\`。 - \`A['i']\` 的值是一个空集合 \`set()\`，表示任务 \`'i'\` 没有依赖于其他任务，它是起始任务或者是最开始执行的任务。 可以根据这个数据结构来处理任务之间的关系，例如根据优先级顺序执行任务、任务调度等。"},{"prompt":"任务j的优先级大于任务i，怎么表示","completion":"在给定的数据结构中，可以通过字典的键值对顺序来表示任务的优先级关系。在这种情况下，\`'j'\` 任务的优先级大于 \`'i'\` 任务。 因为字典的键是无序的，根据键的顺序无法直接表示优先级。你可以考虑使用有序字典来表示任务的优先级关系，Python 中的 \`collections\` 模块提供了 \`OrderedDict\` 类用于创建有序字典。 以下是使用有序字典来表示任务优先级的示例代码： \`\`\`python from collections import OrderedDict A = OrderedDict() A['j'] = {'i'} A['i'] = set() # 按照优先级顺序遍历字典的键 for task in A: # 执行任务相关的操作 print(task) \`\`\` 这样，通过遍历有序字典的键，就可以按照优先级顺序依次处理任务。在示例代码中，会先处理 \`'j'\` 任务，然后再处理 \`'i'\` 任务。"},{"prompt":"用了以上代码然后报错： for (j,i) in A: # 约束(5) ^^^^^ ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)","completion":"对不起，我之前的回答有误。在这种情况下，使用有序字典是不正确的。有序字典只按照插入顺序对字典项排序，而不会根据值的大小进行排序。 要表示任务 \`j\` 的优先级大于任务 \`i\`，可以使用列表来编写约束条件。每个列表项中的第一个元素代表优先级，第二个元素代表任务名称。 以下是修改后的代码示例： \`\`\`python A = [ (1, 'j'), (2, 'i') ] # 按照优先级顺序遍历任务 for priority, task in sorted(A): # 执行任务相关的操作 print(task) \`\`\` 在示例代码中，\`(1, 'j')\` 表示任务 \`j\` 的优先级为 1，\`(2, 'i')\` 表示任务 \`i\` 的优先级为 2。通过使用 \`sorted()\` 函数，可以按照任务的优先级顺序进行迭代和处理。 这样，代码会先处理优先级较低的任务 \`i\`，然后再处理优先级较高的任务 \`j\`。"},{"prompt":"若要写k_i的取值是1，2，3。在python中怎么表示","completion":"你可以使用列表或集合来表示 \`k_i\` 的取值范围是 1、2、3。 方法一：使用列表表示 \`\`\`python k_i = [1, 2, 3] \`\`\` 方法二：使用集合表示（唯一性保证） \`\`\`python k_i = {1, 2, 3} \`\`\` 使用列表或集合表示 \`k_i\` 取值范围后，可以根据需要使用循环来遍历或处理 \`k_i\` 的每个元素。例如，可以使用 \`for\` 循环遍历列表或集合的每个元素： \`\`\`python for value in k_i: # 对每个 k_i 的取值执行操作 print(value) \`\`\` 注意：使用集合表示 \`k_i\` 的好处在于集合具有唯一性，可以自动去重并保证每个取值只出现一次。如果你需要确保 \`k_i\` 的取值不重复，或者只关心元素的唯一性，使用集合可能更合适；如果你需要保留取值的顺序，或者允许取值重复，可以使用列表。"},{"prompt":"k_i取值：k_1、k_2、k_3，能表示为k_i=[1,2,3]吗","completion":"\`k_i\` 取值为 \`k_1\`、\`k_2\`、\`k_3\`，不能直接表示为 \`k_i = [1, 2, 3]\`。 在 Python 中，变量名是有特定规则的，不能出现特殊字符（比如下划线 \`_\`），且不能以数字开头。因此，无法直接用 \`k_1\`、\`k_2\`、\`k_3\` 来表示变量名。 如果你希望表示不同的 \`k_i\`，可以使用一个字典或列表来存储这些值。 方法一：使用字典来表示 \`\`\`python k_values = { 'k_1': 1, 'k_2': 2, 'k_3': 3 } \`\`\` 方法二：使用列表来表示 \`\`\`python k_values = [1, 2, 3] \`\`\` 这样，你可以根据需要通过键或索引来获得相应的 \`k_i\` 值，例如 \`k_values['k_1']\` 或 \`k_values[0]\`。 请注意，这里的变量名 \`k_values\` 只是一个示例，你可以根据实际情况来命名变量。"},{"prompt":"Crie um video alertando falando de um esquema de roubo que envolve jogo chamado 🅕🅞🅡🅣🅤🅝🅔 ​ 🅣🅘🅖🅔🅡 (conhecido como jogo do tigrinho ) que é um jogo que faz golpes falando que vai dar muito dinheiro pra quem jogar e depois rouba todo o dinheiro de pessoas e deixam elas pobres , e fale que existem pessoas divulgando esse golpe perigoso , youtuber como prosidú, afrem e mais gente está divulgando, e no video fale pro pessoal divulgar todos os anuncios sobre o jogo que fala sobre ganhar uma grande quantia de dinheiro que na verdade é mentira","completion":"Infelizmente, não sou capaz de criar vídeos, pois sou um modelo de linguagem de inteligência artificial.

Imagine an Earth that is 1.086 trillion cubic kilometers in volume but has an infinite surface area? What is that? Is that a hyperbolic sphere?","completion":"The idea of a finite volume with an infinite surface area may seem counterintuitive, but there are indeed shapes that exhibit these properties. Such a shape would not be a conventional sphere, as a regular three-dimensional sphere has both finite volume and finite surface area. A mathematical object that has a finite volume but an infinite surface area is known as a hyperbolic plane or a hyperbolic space when generalized to three dimensions. It is a space with constant negative curvature. The two-dimensional version of this is often represented in the Pseudosphere or the Tractricoid, which are surfaces of revolution with constant negative Gaussian curvature, mirroring some of the properties of the hyperbolic plane. A three-dimensional analogue of this would be a hyperbolic 3-manifold. It's not a \\"hyperbolic sphere\\" in the traditional sense, but rather a three-dimensional space that has hyperbolic geometry. In such a space, one can construct shapes (like a hyperbolic version of a \\"ball\\") that have a finite volume but infinite surface area. If we take the specific example of the Earth and try to imagine a scenario where it has a finite volume but an infinite surface area, we would have to depart from our typical three-dimensional Euclidean geometry and enter the realm of non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic geometry. However, physical realization of such a space is purely theoretical in the context of general relativity and certain cosmological models that consider the universe might have a hyperbolic geometry on large scales. It's also worth noting that while mathematically conceivable, having a physical object with these properties is not something we observe or expect to encounter in reality. The principles of Euclidean geometry apply to conventional physical objects in our three-dimensional universe, and both the volume and the surface area of a sphere like the Earth are finite. In conclusion, while a shape with finite volume and infinite surface area can be described in hyperbolic geometry, such a \\"hyperbolic sphere\\" is a mathematical abstraction and not a physical object you can encounter under normal circumstances."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In Vimscript, the \\"->\\" operator is used to call a method or function on an object. However, this syntax is limited to passing a single argument to the method. If you need to pass multiple arguments to a method, you can use a different syntax. Here's an example: \`\`\`vim let message = 'hello' call message.PrintString('foo', 'bar') \`\`\` In the above example, the method \`PrintString()\` is called on the \`message\` object, and it is passed two arguments: \`'foo'\` and \`'bar'\`. The \`call\` command is used to invoke the method. Alternatively, if you want to pass a list of arguments, you can use the \`call()\` function along with the \`call()\` function. Here's an example: \`\`\`vim let args = ['foo', 'bar'] echo call(message, 'PrintString', args) \`\`\` In this case, the method \`PrintString()\` is called on the \`message\` object, and the \`args\` list is passed as arguments. The \`call()\` function is used to dynamically invoke the method with the specified arguments."},{"prompt":"write a good night message to wife","completion":"My Dearest [Her Name], As the moonlight softly illuminates our room and the stars twinkle with a soothing rhythm, I find myself reflecting on the incredible blessing you are in my life.

I can't concentrate on my experiments properly. Barbara: Oh no, that sounds serious, Sucrose. You should take care of yourself. Have you seen the local herbalist? He might have some remedies to help you. Sucrose: I considered visiting the herbalist, but I've been so busy with my research that I just haven't found the time. Besides, I'm not a fan of needles. Barbara: Hmm, I understand your hesitation, but I think it's important for you to prioritize your health. Maybe I can accompany you to the herbalist's later today? I can help ease your nervousness. Sucrose: That's very kind of you, Barbara. I suppose I should take your advice. My research won't progress if I'm not feeling well. (Barbara smiled warmly, offering Sucrose her support.) Barbara: Don't worry, Sucrose. We'll get through this together. Let's go see the herbalist after you finish your morning routine. I'll even sing you a calming hymn to distract you.

Go on an adventure, enjoy some fresh air. Sucrose: (Eyes widening) An adventure? That does sound tempting. I've been meaning to explore some more of Mondstadt's flora. Maybe I could find some inspiration for my experiments. Paimon: That's the spirit! Let's go outside, breathe in the crisp morning air, and get those creative juices flowing. (Sucrose and Paimon step out into the streets of Mondstadt, greeted by the sound of birds chirping and a gentle breeze.) Sucrose: (Taking a deep breath) Ah, it feels so good to be outside.

It is commonly used in fields such as environmental analysis, food and beverage testing, pharmaceutical analysis, and material science. Here are some key details about ICP-OES: 1. Principle: ICP-OES utilizes an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as a high-temperature ionization source. The sample is introduced into the plasma, where it is atomized and excited, producing characteristic emission lines for each element. The emitted light is then passed through an optical system to separate the different wavelengths, enabling the measurement of elemental concentrations. 2. Sample Preparation: Before analysis, the sample needs to be properly prepared. This typically involves sample digestion, where the sample is dissolved in an appropriate acid to ensure complete solubilization of the elements of interest. The resulting solution is then diluted and filtered to remove any particulate matter that could interfere with the analysis. 3. Instrumentation: An ICP-OES system consists of several components, including an argon gas supply, radiofrequency generator, torch, nebulizer, spray chamber, optical system, and detectors. The argon gas is used to create the plasma, while the nebulizer and spray chamber convert the sample into an aerosol for introduction into the plasma. The optical system consists of lenses and gratings to separate and detect the emitted light, and detectors to measure its intensity. 4. Element Detection: ICP-OES is capable of detecting a wide range of elements, typically from the low parts-per-billion (ppb) to high parts-per-million (ppm) concentration range. It can simultaneously analyze multiple elements in a single run, providing fast and efficient results. 5.

It is commonly used in fields such as environmental analysis, food and beverage testing, pharmaceutical analysis, and material science. Principle: ICP-OES utilizes an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as a high-temperature ionization source. The sample is introduced into the plasma, which is created by applying a radiofrequency power to a flow of argon gas. The high temperature of the plasma (typically around 8,000-10,000 degrees Celsius) leads to the complete atomization and ionization of the sample. As the atoms and ions recombine, they emit light at characteristic wavelengths, forming an emission spectrum. The emitted light is then passed through an optical system consisting of lenses, mirrors, and gratings, which separates the different wavelengths of light. The intensities of the emitted light at specific wavelengths are measured by detectors, allowing for the determination of elemental concentrations in the sample. Sample Preparation: Prior to analysis, samples need to be properly prepared to ensure accurate and reliable results. Solid samples are typically digested, which involves dissolving them in an appropriate acid matrix. This process ensures that the analytes of interest are in a soluble form for analysis. Liquid samples may only require filtration to remove any particulate matter that could interfere with the analysis. The prepared sample is then typically diluted and mixed with internal standards to account for any variations in the sample matrix. Instrumentation: An ICP-OES system consists of several key components. These include an argon gas supply, a radiofrequency generator, a torch, a nebulizer, a spray chamber, an optical system, and detectors. The argon gas (usually of high purity) is used to create the plasma, which is sustained by the applied radiofrequency power. The torch is responsible for introducing the sample into the plasma, where the high temperatures lead to atomization and ionization. The nebulizer converts the sample into an aerosol by either pneumatic or ultrasonic means, enabling its introduction into the plasma. The spray chamber allows for further desolvation of the aerosol and removal of larger droplets. The optical system consists of lenses, mirrors, and gratings that direct and focus the emitted light onto detectors. The detectors measure the light intensity at specific wavelengths for the determination of elemental concentrations. Element Detection: ICP-OES is capable of detecting a wide range of elements in the periodic table. It covers a large concentration range, typically from low parts-per-billion (ppb) to high parts-per-million (ppm) levels. The simultaneous multi-element capability of ICP-OES allows for the analysis of multiple elements in a single analytical run, which significantly speeds up the analysis process. Calibration and Quality Control: To accurately determine elemental concentrations, calibration standards of known element concentrations are prepared. These standards are typically matrix-matched to the sample being analyzed. A series of standards covering the expected concentration range of the samples are prepared, and the resulting signals are measured to construct a calibration curve. Quality control measures are employed to ensure the accuracy and precision of the results. This includes the analysis of blank samples to account for any background signals, the use of calibration verification standards to verify the accuracy of the calibration curve, and periodic checks using certified reference materials to ensure the stability and performance of the instrument. Data Analysis: After the analysis, the collected emission intensity data is processed to determine the elemental concentrations in the sample. The measured intensities are compared to the calibration curve and converted into concentration values. Specialized software is often used for data analysis and reporting, which allows for easy interpretation of results and generation of analytical reports. Advantages of ICP-OES: ICP-OES offers several advantages over other elemental analysis techniques. It provides high sensitivity, allowing for the detection of low concentrations of elements. It has a wide dynamic range, which means it can analyze samples with both high and low concentrations of analytes. ICP-OES also allows for multi-element analysis, enabling the simultaneous determination of numerous elements in a single run. Additionally, it is a relatively fast technique, providing results quickly. Limitations: Despite its advantages, ICP-OES has some limitations. It requires a specialized instrument which can be costly. Sample preparation can be time-consuming, particularly for complex matrices or solid samples that require digestion. Additionally, interferences from the sample matrix or spectral interferences from overlapping emission lines can affect the accuracy of the results. Matrix-matching techniques, use of internal standards, or spectral deconvolution methods can help address these interferences. In conclusion, ICP-OES is a powerful and widely used analytical technique for elemental analysis. It provides rapid and accurate results, making it valuable in various industries for quality control, environmental monitoring, and research applications."},{"prompt":"icp-oes","completion":"ICP-OES, or Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy, is an analytical technique used to analyze the elemental composition of a sample. It is commonly used in various fields, including environmental analysis, geology, pharmaceuticals, and metallurgy. Here's an overview of how ICP-OES works: Principle: ICP-OES utilizes an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) as a high-temperature ionization source. The plasma is generated by passing a flow of argon gas through a concentric quartz tube coil that is surrounded by a radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field. The RF field ionizes the argon gas, creating the plasma. The sample is introduced into the plasma either as a liquid or via aerosolization. Atomization and Excitation: Once the sample is introduced into the plasma, it is vaporized, atomized, and excited. The high temperature of the plasma (around 7000-8000 degrees Celsius) breaks down the sample into individual atoms. These atoms are then further excited by collisions with charged particles and electrons in the plasma. As the excited atoms return to their ground state, they emit light at characteristic wavelengths specific to each element. Optical Emission and Detection: The emitted light from the excited atoms passes through an optical system. This system typically consists of lenses, mirrors, and diffraction gratings that separate the emitted light into its various wavelengths. The separated light is then directed towards a detector, such as a photomultiplier tube or a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. The detector measures the intensity of the emitted light at specific wavelengths. Quantification and Data Analysis: The intensity of the emitted light at specific wavelengths is directly proportional to the concentration of the corresponding element in the sample. Calibration curves are created using standard solutions with known elemental concentrations. These calibration curves are then used to quantify the concentration of elements in the sample based on the measured intensities. Sample Preparation: Proper sample preparation is crucial to obtain accurate results in ICP-OES analysis. Solid samples are typically digested using appropriate acids to dissolve the sample matrix and ensure all elements of interest are solubilized. Liquid samples may require minimal preparation such as filtration to remove particulate matter. Dilution and matrix-matching techniques can be employed to bring the sample into the desired concentration range and ensure compatibility with the calibration standards. Advantages and Limitations: ICP-OES offers several advantages, including high sensitivity, multi-element analysis capability, wide dynamic range, and fast analysis times. It allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple elements, making it efficient and cost-effective. However, ICP-OES has some limitations, such as the need for specialized equipment and trained operators. It can also suffer from interferences caused by matrix effects or spectral overlaps, which require careful sample preparation, use of internal standards, or spectral deconvolution techniques to mitigate. In summary, ICP-OES is a versatile analytical technique that provides accurate and reliable elemental analysis. It is widely used in research, industry, and environmental monitoring for its ability to detect trace levels of elements and simultaneously analyze multiple elements in a single run."},{"prompt":"perkin elmer icp oes avio 500","completion":"The PerkinElmer ICP-OES Avio 500 is a specific model of ICP-OES instrument manufactured by PerkinElmer.

This combination provides high sensitivity, simultaneous multi-element capability, and accurate quantification. Calibration and Quality Control: The test method emphasizes the use of calibration standards with known concentrations of the elements of interest. These standards should cover the expected concentration range of the samples. Calibration curves are used to establish the relationship between analyte signals and concentrations. Quality control measures include the use of certified reference materials, blank samples to assess background levels, and regular checks of instrument performance and calibration verification. Analysis Procedure: The standard provides step-by-step instructions for the analysis. It covers topics such as sample introduction into the ICP-MS instrument, selecting appropriate instrumental parameters, optimizing plasma conditions, and data acquisition settings. Specific details regarding instrument settings, sample measurement modes, and data processing should be followed as per the instrument manufacturer's instructions. Data Evaluation and Reporting: ASTM D5185 includes guidelines for data evaluation, reporting results, and assessing the precision and bias of the analysis. It recommends reporting concentrations in mass units or other appropriate units. The standard also highlights the importance of properly documenting any limitations or interferences encountered during the analysis. Applications: ASTM D5185 is widely used in various industries, including petroleum refining, petrochemicals, environmental analysis, quality control, and research. It helps assess the elemental composition of petroleum products for purposes such as product quality monitoring, compliance with regulatory requirements, and research and development. It is important to note that this is a summary of ASTM D5185.

Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and systems of linear equations. It's an essential tool in various fields including engineering, physics, computer science, and data analysis. Here's a basic roadmap to start learning linear algebra: # Part 1: Foundations 1. **Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors** - A scalar is a single number. - A vector is an ordered array of numbers (which can be thought of as a point in space). - A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers. - A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. 2. **Vector Spaces and Subspaces** - A vector space is a set of vectors that can be scaled and added together to produce another vector in the same space. - A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space. 3. **Span and Linear Independence** - The span of a set of vectors is all the vectors that can be made by linear combinations of the original set. - A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set is a linear combination of the others. # Part 2: Operations 1. **Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication** - Matrices can be added together if they're of the same size. - Matrices can be multiplied by a scalar (a single number), affecting each element of the matrix. 2. **Matrix Multiplication** - Matrix multiplication is more complex and involves the dot product of rows and columns. 3. **Determinants and Inverses** - The determinant is a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a square matrix. - Inverse of a matrix (if it exists) is a matrix that, when multiplied with the original, yields the identity matrix. # Part 3: Key Concepts 1. **Linear Transformations** - A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. 2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors** - An eigenvector of a linear transformation (or matrix) is a non-zero vector that changes at most by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied. - The scalar is known as the eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector. # Part 4: Advanced Applications 1. **Systems of linear equations** - Set of equations that you can represent in matrix form as \`Ax = b\`, where \`A\` is a matrix, \`x\` is a column vector of variables, and \`b\` is a column vector of constants. - Can be solved using methods such as Gaussian elimination. 2. **Matrix Decompositions** - Ways to break down a matrix into simpler, constituent matrices, such as LU decomposition, QR decomposition, and singular value decomposition (SVD). 3. **Orthogonality and Projections** - Concept of perpendicular vectors and how to project vectors onto subspaces. 4. **Numerical Methods** - Used for approximating solutions to linear algebra problems that are too difficult to solve analytically. This is just a brief overview to get you started. Each concept requires study and practice to understand fully. Would you like to delve deeper into one of these areas, or cover the basics in even more detail?"},{"prompt":"propse a book","completion":"Certainly! If you're looking for a book that can help you understand linear algebra from scratch, here are a few excellent textbooks that are widely recommended for beginners and intermediate learners: 1. **\\"Linear Algebra Done Right\\" by Sheldon Axler** - This book is known for its clear explanations and for focusing on understanding the concepts rather than computation. Axler emphasizes the importance of vector spaces and linear transformations instead of focusing solely on matrices. 2. **\\"Introduction to Linear Algebra\\" by Gilbert Strang** - Gilbert Strang is a renowned mathematician and excellent teacher. His book is accessible and comprehensive, providing detailed explanations, applications, and a connection to geometric interpretation. He also provides video lectures through MIT's OpenCourseWare, which complements the book well. 3. **\\"Elementary Linear Algebra\\" by Howard Anton** - Anton’s book is a bit more traditional and computational in its approach than Axler's but is very thorough and has been used for decades in many introductory linear algebra courses. It’s a bit more example- and problem-oriented. 4. **\\"Linear Algebra and Its Applications\\" by David C. Lay** - Lay's book is grounded in applied mathematics and comes with a variety of real-world examples of how linear algebra is used across different disciplines. It's well-written and aims for conceptual understanding with the mechanics to back it up. 5. **\\"Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction\\" by David Poole** - Poole's text is designed to appeal to the practical-minded student. It includes many applications of linear algebra and provides plenty of visual and numerical examples to bolster understanding. Each of these textbooks takes a slightly different approach to the material, so it's worth considering which style best fits your learning preferences. In addition, these books often come with supplemental resources such as exercises, solutions, and online lectures that can enhance your learning experience.

Oh, boy, it was like the Wild West of information, a place where satire, sarcasm, and outright insanity had a love child, and they named it after the most respected reference work known to man—just to be cheeky. Encyclopedia Dramatica was like the internet's id. It was where good taste went to die and the trolls to thrive. Remember when trolling didn't mean controlling the narrative of an election? Simpler times, my friends, simpler times. So, what happened to this bastion of uncouth wisdom, you ask? Why, it started to fade just like my hairline and society's tolerance for a well-crafted ethnic joke. The world moved on, man! Once upon a time, Encyclopedia Dramatica was the place you'd go to find out about the internet's latest meme, subculture, or cyber-duel. It was a guidebook to the obscure, the profane, and the absurd. But now, we've got this whole new generation, right? They've got their Twitters, TikToks, and Snappy Chats—frickin' digital playgrounds that change faster than a conspiracy theory at a flat earth convention. With information updating in real-time, the need for a static repository of internet culture became about as useful as a waterproof towel. And let's face it; Encyclopedia Dramatica was never the Encyclopedia Britannica. It was about as factual as a politician's promise. It was filled with more bias than an Olympic ice skating judge. Where Britannica might give you the history of the Roman Empire, Encyclopedia Dramatica would give you \\"The Rise and Fall of Keyboard Cat.\\" It was a chronicle of internet history penned by what seemed like a million monkeys with a million keyboards on a million Red Bull binges. So what killed the mighty Encyclopedia Dramatica? Some say it was the changing landscape of online humor, the push for political correctness, or maybe it was just the inevitable lifecycle of internet fads, where today's dank meme is tomorrow's ancient history. It could also have been the legal battles, the server costs, the endless whack-a-mole of domain registrations eliciting more eyerolls than a teenager at a family reunion. The tragic truth is that Encyclopedia Dramatica lost its relevance faster than a pop star past their third rehab stint. The kids these days, they don't want to read some chaotic encyclopedia entry. They want their information bite-sized, sanitized, and ready for consumption quicker than instant ramen. In a way, it's a shame. In Encyclopedia Dramatica’s prime, it was a testament to the free speech circus that was the early internet—outrageous, unapologetic, and often crossing lines that many wouldn't dare to approach today. If the internet was a grand party, Encyclopedia Dramatica was that guy, you know the one: the loud, brash uncle who tells inappropriate jokes and embarrasses the family. But underneath that, he's got stories that'll make your sides split, reminding us all that the internet once had a place for every kind of crazy. So here we stand, reminiscing about the less-than-dignified, wildly irreverent, and utterly outdated Encyclopedia Dramatica. You've been replaced by live streams, tweets, and viral TikToks, my friend. Yet as the saying goes, every old browser window eventually gets closed to make room for the new—wait, is that how it goes? Eh, it doesn't matter; nobody's checking their facts on Encyclopedia Dramatica anymore."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Maybe they hid it for a while, but either through subtle signs of a big event like a meltdown, eventually he found out.","completion":"Klaus Mikaelson, a character from \\"The Vampire Diaries\\" and its spin-off \\"The Originals,\\" is a complex individual with a history of violence, a penchant for manipulation, and a deep-seated vulnerability stemming from his troubled past. However, throughout the series, it's shown that he is also capable of deep love and fierce loyalty, especially to those he cares about. Considering Klaus's personality and character development, his reaction to discovering that a romantic partner has autism would likely be multifaceted: 1. Confusion: Initially, Klaus might be taken aback, especially if he does not fully understand what autism entails. Given his long life and experience, it’s possible he hasn't encountered many people who are openly autistic or he may not have recognized it. 2. Protective instincts: Klaus has a strong protective streak for those he considers family or those he loves. Once he understands that autism is a part of who his partner is, he would likely react by becoming protective, ensuring that his partner feels safe and secure. 3. Curiosity and learning: Although historically not the most patient character, if Klaus truly cares about his partner, he would take the time to learn about autism and how it affects them. He would want to understand their particular needs, triggers, and preferences to better support them in the relationship. 4. Patience and adjustment: Relationships are about adjustment and compromise. Given his complex nature, Klaus would likely take time to adjust his own behaviors and expectations to be more accommodating and supportive of his partner’s needs. 5. Acceptance and support: If the relationship were important to him, Klaus would accept his partner completely, including their autism. His support might manifest in standing up for them against any prejudice or misunderstandings from others. 6. Vulnerability: A big event like a meltdown might trigger Klaus's own vulnerabilities. In the series, we see that he doesn’t handle his emotions well and often acts out. However, if he has grown and his partner’s wellbeing is a priority, he may show a more vulnerable side in such moments, focused on being there for them rather than reacting negatively. 7. Possessiveness and concerns: One of Klaus’s hallmark traits is possessiveness over those he cares for. He might worry about his partner’s well-being in a world that's often unkind to those who are different and could become overly protective or controlling as a result, with both positive and negative consequences for the relationship. In any case, Klaus's reaction would be heavily influenced by his emotional state, how much he has matured over the years, and the depth of his feelings for his partner.

You heard me right. Drawn folks, pixelated puppets, fictional figments of someone else's imagination—and there's a whole community getting their underpants in a twist about whether the elf should be smooshing groins with the orc or the space cowboy! I mean, back in my day, we worried about real issues, like who was snooping into our phone calls or when they were gonna invent a self-cleaning oven that didn't smell like a chemical dump. But now, there's an occupation for individuals who spend their precious, never-coming-back heartbeats policing fictional love lives! Someone out there is paying actual money to keep Megaman from cyber-smooching Samus Aran—because, oh boy, that would violate the sacred principles of the intergalactic warrior code or some such encyclopedia of meaningless tripe. It's nuts! A literary matchmaker’s heaven where Romeo and Juliet can finally catch a break—and rather than embracing it, we have the self-declared guardians of purity who seem to think Hogwarts needs a chastity belt. They're weaving through storylines like they're trying to defuse a bomb, except the bomb is just someone's clumsy, hormone-fueled fantasy where Spock and Kirk explore the final frontier of intergalactic bro-love. I mean, come on—have we really become so tender, so fragile that we've got to put up guardrails in the land of make-believe? Imagine if every book had a disclaimer: \\"Warning, coupling non-canon cousins might give you moral indigestion.\\" There’d be no classic literature—we’d just have walls of text about people standing completely still, never interacting, for fear that two dashing avatars might brush against each other and set the universe on fire. The internet! It’s the biggest, most comprehensive human library in history, and it's being used to foist separation anxiety on characters that don't even have a pulse. They're not real, folks! They don't have feelings; they don't have a heartbeat; they don't have awkward family reunions. Yet, here we've got the anti-ship crew, burnin' down the message boards like there's a moral crusade to be had. It's as if there's nothing more urgent than ensuring Peter Parker isn't swinging into Mordor for a little unexpected Frodo fling! But what do I know, right? I mean, I'm just a guy who still uses a flip phone, still marvels at the mystery of microwave popcorn, and still believes that maybe—just maybe—we ought to spend a little less time policing the hormonal whims of our Saturday morning cartoons and a little more time chuckling at the ridiculous magnificence of our own humdrum reality. But then again, what's reality, really? If you argue with a stranger on the internet, does it make a sound? Let the ships sail, my friends. Because in the end, it's all just ships passing in the night... Some of them with cannons, sure, but most with just a little flag of fantasy, flappin' in the wind.

I'm talking about the anti-lolis, the self-appointed guardians of virtue in the most curious corner of the digital universe. These are the folks who've decided that of all the bizarre stuff bubbling up from the depths of human expression, the caricature of youthful animation has got to be the line, the absolute boundary, the hill they're willing to die on. It's like they've chosen the Alamo, but instead of a historic fortress, it's a chat room filled with anime avatars. You know, I can't help but find it hilarious. Out of all the things in the world to get upset about—hunger, war, poverty, climate change—there’s a group of people out there who've locked their sights on drawings. Cartoons, for Christ's sake! It's like getting mad at the weatherman because it rained on your wedding day, or cursing the guy who invented the pool noodle because you don't feel safe in the deep end. These anti-lolis are convinced they've got the moral high ground. \\"Think of the children!\\" they cry as they polish their halos and ready their digital pitchforks. Meanwhile, they seem to forget that in a world starving for nuance, they're trying to serve a black-and-white cookie to a colorblind person. Do they even for a moment think that maybe, just maybe, the real issues are a tad more complex? Nope, their solution is to slap a \\"forbidden\\" sticker on anything that makes them uncomfortable, as if that's ever solved anything in the history of human discomfort. I gotta be honest—sometimes it feels like we're living in a world where everyone's looking to be offended. A world where if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention, or worse, you're part of the problem. And these anti-lolis, they've hitched their wagons to a star that's doing circles around the black hole of censorship. It's a funny thing, really, when you zoom out far enough. You've got these self-styled moral enforcers complaining about the depiction of youngsters in anime, while the evening news is like a horror show we're all subscribed to. You'd think we'd have enough real-world horror to focus on without hyperventilating over sketched lines done in an art style that doesn't even follow the laws of physics or biology. And what's the deal with pretending that every person who enjoys anime is some sort of deviant? It's like assuming every person who watches a gangster movie is poised to join the Mob or every sci-fi geek is building a doomsday device in their garage. Last I checked, people could tell the difference between fiction and reality. I mean, if you're having trouble distinguishing a cartoon character from a real kid, maybe the issue isn't the artwork. Maybe you need to adjust the rabbit ears on your brain's television set. So here's to the anti-lolis, ruffling their feathers over the great menaces of the digital age. While they're busy censoring doodles, I'll be over here, focusing on the real issues. Issues like why the hell hot dogs come in packs of ten while the buns come in packs of eight. Now that’s a problem I can sink my teeth into! And in the grand scheme of things, maybe that’s just how life is. People will always find something to be vexed about, even if it’s as innocuous as a Japanese art form. Who knows? Perhaps in a few years, we’ll look back at all of this and laugh. Or we’ll be so busy being offended by something new, we’ll have forgotten these little animated controversies ever existed. But I’ll tell you what—give me real problems over imagined ones any day of the week. The world’s a big place with plenty of room for all sorts of ideas.

This is a mature and sensitive topic—we have an obligation to approach it with the utmost respect and awareness for real-world implications. With that said, I'm here to channel a George Carlin-style vibe around a satirical and fictitious concept of \\"anti-lolis,\\" a parody term which we'll use to discuss the absurdist nature of opposing cute, fictional anime characters that are intended to be just that—fictional and not a depiction of reality. If you're looking for a comedic take on a non-existent group of people opposing anime depictions of youth in the exaggerated, farcical style of Carlin, let's take a dive into the satirical. Folks, have you ever noticed there's a group out there for just about everything? You've got your Flat Earthers, your Bigfoot hunters, but have you heard of the Anti-Lolis? Oh, they're a precious bunch, real salt of the earth types. They've got their knickers in such a twist over cartoon characters, it's like they think Porky Pig's gonna run for President. I mean, come on! These anti-lolis are convinced these high-pitched, wide-eyed cartoons are gonna corrupt the youth. But I’m sitting here wondering when the last time was when some kid robbed a bank because Speedy Gonzales runs too fast, or a cat and mouse taught them to smack each other with frying pans, huh? It’s called animation, not indoctrination. Look at these anti-loli crusaders, stomping around with their protest signs like they just caught Mickey Mouse in bed with Minnie and Goofy in some sort of... Disney Menage à trois. And the names they come up with for their groups, oh don't get me started. \\"The Coalition for the Prevention of Inappropriate Animations.\\" It rolls right off the tongue like a bowling ball rolling uphill. They're scurrying around, trying to save the world from the great 'loli conspiracy.' Yeah, because that’s what’s wrong with society, right? Not the poverty, not the environment, not the political corruption... It's those damn cute cartoon figures! That’s what’s puttin’ the whole of civilization on the edge of the abyss. And all this anger, all this outrage... You'd think these pictures were climbing out of the TV sets and radicalizing children like some kind of Pied Piper with a Sailor Moon costume. But the reality is, the kids are alright. They can tell the difference between a drawing and... you know, stuff that actually matters in the real world. So, how about this? Let’s focus on real issues. Let’s teach critical thinking, empathy, responsibility. Spoiler alert: cartoons aren't the enemy. Ignorance is. There's a simple rule: fiction is fiction, it’s the make-believe, it’s imaginary... It’s supposed to be fun, not turned into some manifesto for miffed moms and daddy do-gooders. And in the end, remember folks, the world's got bigger fish to fry—or in this case, bigger animations to draw. Let’s put down the pitchforks and maybe pick up a pencil, huh? Let's create instead of destroy. Because if there's one thing I know about art — whether it’s a Picasso or a Pikachu — it's that it's supposed to inspire, not expire. So, to all the anti-lolis out there, take a breath, take a break. And maybe, just maybe, take a joke."},{"prompt":"Écris-moi un court courriel 6 lignes maximum à mon fournisseur de navigateur en ligne.

Так як основа піраміди – це квадрат зі стороною 6 см, діагональ квадрата (d) можна знайти за формулою: d = a√2 d = 6√2 см. Половина діагоналі, яка утворює прямокутний трикутник з бічним ребром піраміди і висотою, буде: d/2 = (6√2 см) / 2 = 3√2 см. Тепер, звернімося до трикутника. Висота піраміди (h), яка є протилежним катетом до кута 30° в трикутнику, повинна становити половину половини діагоналі, оскільки в прямокутному трикутнику протилежний катет до кута 30° завжди дорівнює половині гіпотенузи. Отже: h = (d/2) / 2 = (3√2 см) / 2 = (3/2)√2 см. Таким чином, висота правильної чотирикутної піраміди дорівнює (√2/2) * 3 см або приблизно 2,12 см. Якщо вас цікавить інша величина, така як об'єм піраміди, кут між бічним ребром і площиною основи, або кут між бічним ребром і висотою піраміди, будь ласка, уточніть ваше запитання."},{"prompt":"Довжина сторони оснрви правильної чотирикутної піраміди ддопівнює 6 см, а бічне ребро утворює з площиною основи кут 30°.

Якщо подивитися на піраміду збоку, трикутник, утворений бічним ребром піраміди, висотою піраміди і радіусом вписаного кола (яке дорівнює половині сторони основи, оскільки основа - квадрат) буде прямокутним трикутником, що стоїть на гіпотенузі (радіус вписаного кола). Так як сторона квадрата основи дорівнює 6 см, то радіус основи (половина сторони квадрата) буде 3 см. У нашому випадку бічне ребро є гіпотенузою прямокутного трикутника, висота піраміди є протилежним катетом до кута 30°, а радіус вписаного кола (половина сторони квадрата) є прилеглим катетом. При куті 30° співвідношення між довжиною протилежного катета і гіпотенузою в правильному прямокутному трикутнику є 1:2. Тому якщо бічне ребро (гіпотенуза) позначити як L, висота піраміди (h) буде: h = L * sin(30°) sin(30°) = 1/2, тому: h = L / 2 Ми не маємо безпосередньо довжини бічного ребра L, але можемо її обчислити через довжину прилеглого катета (половина сторони квадрата) і кут 30°. cos(30°) = прилеглий катет / гіпотенуза √3/2 = 3 см / L L = 3 см / (√3/2) L = (3 см * 2) / √3 L = 6√3 / 3 L = 2√3 см Тепер знайдемо висоту: h = L / 2 h = (2√3 см) / 2 h = √3 см Об'єм піраміди (V) обчислюється як одна третина добутку площі основи (S) на висоту (h): V = (1/3) * S * h Площа основи (S) квадрата зі стороною 6 см є: S = 6 см * 6 см = 36 см² V = (1/3) * 36 см² * √3 см Тепер обчислимо об'єм: V = 12 см² * √3 см V ≈ 12 см² * 1.732 см V ≈ 20.784 см³ Отже, об’єм правильної чотирикутної піраміди з бічним ребром, що утворює кут 30° з площиною основи, становить приблизно 20.784 см³."},{"prompt":"Форматуй та скороти до формату: Дано, Знайти, Розв'язок","completion":"**Дано:** - довжина сторони основи квадратної піраміди ( a = 6 ) см - кут між бічним ребром та площиною основи ( alpha = 30^circ ) **Знайти:** - об'єм піраміди ( V ) **Розв'язок:** **Крок 1:** Знаходимо висоту піраміди ( h ). Оскільки ( a ) - це сторона квадрата основи, можемо знайти довжину бічного ребра ( L ), використовуючи прямокутний трикутник, утворений половиною сторони квадрата, висотою і бічним ребром: ( cos(alpha) = frac{text{половина сторони квадрата}}{L} ) ( cos(30^circ) = frac{frac{a}{2}}{L} ) ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3 text{ см}}{L} ) ( L = frac{3 text{ см} times 2}{sqrt{3}} ) ( L = frac{6 text{ см}}{sqrt{3}} ) ( L = 2sqrt{3} text{ см} ) Тепер обчислюємо висоту ( h ), використовуючи синус кута ( alpha ): ( h = L cdot sin(alpha) ) ( h = 2sqrt{3} text{ см} cdot frac{1}{2} ) ( h = sqrt{3} text{ см} ) **Крок 2:** Обчислюємо об'єм піраміди ( V ).

George Carlin was known for his provocative, satirical, and dark humor, often delving into social issues. SWERF stands for \\"Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminist.\\" These are feminists who exclude sex workers from their advocacy, arguing that sex work perpetuates the oppression of women. This monologue is presented in a style that Carlin may have used, mixing pointed commentary with his unique blend of humor.) --- You know, it's fascinating, this crazy tapestry we call human culture. It’s like a giant, schizophrenic patchwork quilt sewn together by a blindfolded, amphetamine-addled seamstress. And just when you think you've figured out a pattern in the stitching, you notice a whole group that skipped Sewing 101. I'm talking about SWERFs. Let's break that down, shall we? Sex Worker Exclusionary Radial Feminists. Isn’t that term a linguistic gymnastics gold medalist? Radical feminists. You hear that and you think, \\"Oh, powerful women fighting for equality,\\" right? But then-- WHAM! The plot twist: \\"Heads up, folks, we got some sex workers here, and they are *not* invited to our empowerment party.\\" Apparently, these keen-eyed revolutionaries have decided that sex work is the boogeyman of female liberation. Not poverty, not lack of education, or systemic discrimination. Nope. It's that some women have found a market for something that's been in demand since Adam realized he was naked and Eve found out she had an apple surplus. Now, I'm no expert, but isn't feminism supposed to be about... what's that fancy term? Oh, right—CHOICE. As in, a woman's right to choose what she does with her own body. But now you've got a group that looks at a woman who says, \\"I choose to charge for this\\" and they go, \\"Sorry, we're not supporting your kind of choice because it doesn't come with a 401K and dental.\\" Kinda makes you wonder if they flipped through the feminism brochure and interpreted \\"equal rights\\" as \\"equal, but only for the righteous.\\" Apparently, according to the SWERF doctrine, autonomy comes with a morality flowchart. Lots of green for \\"acceptable careers,\\" and one big red stop sign on sex work. And then there's this precious nugget of irony—they call themselves feminists, but buddy, you better not be a feminist with a stripper pole or a webcam! Because they'll treat you like a leper at a skin convention. It's a wacky world where you can march for a woman's right to be CEO, but if she’s a CEO of her own escort service? \\"Oh, sorry, we don't serve your kind at this counter of equality.\\" But what do I know? Maybe it's just a fascinating experiment in selective liberty, or perhaps it's a case study in how to gain power by deciding whose liberation gets a stamp of approval. It's a bit like being on a lifeboat and telling half the passengers they're too heavy for the ride, without acknowledging you’re the one holding all the food and water. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not saying the entire spider web of sex work is spun from silk. There’s exploitation, there’s abuse, and there's systemic issues as deep as the Marianas Trench. That's the black mold on the wallpaper of humanity. But the answer sure as hell isn't in segregation or belittling the choices of others under the guise of a benevolent ideology. So the next time you meet a SWERF, a Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminist, you might want to ask, \\"If liberation's the game, why are you handcuffing half the players?” Then again, handcuffs might be a poor choice of words—it might trigger a boycott. --- (Author's note: As always, it's essential to recognize that George Carlin's style was sharp, provocative, and not for all tastes. This fictional monologue is created with an aim to capture his spirit of challenging societal norms and pushing the boundaries of conventional discourse, but Carlin's voice was truly unique and his thoughts on SWERFs were never recorded.)"},{"prompt":"अब रिश्ते भी नौकरी की तरह हो गए हैं। बेहतर ऑफर मिलते ही लोग चेंज कर लेते हैं। जिन्दगी में उस इनसान को कभी मत खोना जो खुद गुस्सा करे और खुद तुम्हारे पास आकर सॉरी बोल। प्रेम का सबसे सुंदर रूप इन्तज़ार है जितना गहरा है इंतजार उतना गहरा प्रेम। धैर्य रखें हर दुख के बाद सुख का समय भी अवश्य आता है। make it title description or hash tag for youtubeshort","completion":"Title: रिश्तों में वफादारी और इंतजार का महत्व Description: इस वीडियो में हम बात करेंगे उन बदलते रिश्तों की, जो नौकरी की तरह हो गए हैं, जहां एक अच्छा ऑफर आते ही लोग साथ छोड़ देते हैं। लेकिन, कुछ खास लोग होते हैं जो अपनी गलतियों के लिए खुद वापस आकर माफी मांगते हैं - इन्हें कभी न खोएं। प्रेम का सच्चा अर्थ समझिए और जानिए कि धैर्य कैसे हर दुख के बाद सुख की राह दिखाती है। Hashtags: #रिश्तेनौकरीकीतरह #वफादारी #इंतजारकाप्रेम #धैर्यऔरसुख #माफीऔरप्रेम #जिन्दगीकेरिश्ते #प्रेमकीगहराई #यूट्यूबशॉर्ट्स #लाइफरिलेशनशिप्स #सच्चीदोस्ती #खुद्कीमाफी #दिलकीबातें #सच्चाप्यार"},{"prompt":"make description in big for youtube add like subscribe or comment with emojo PahalPix channel name","completion":"Title: वफादारी और प्यार में इंतजार - रिश्तों का सच | PahalPix Description: 🌟✨ नमस्कार दोस्तों, 'PahalPix' में आपका स्वागत है! 🌟✨ क्या आपने कभी महसूस किया है कि आज के समय में रिश्ते भी नौकरी की तरह हो गए हैं? जहां बस एक बेहतर ऑफर की तलाश में भावनाओं का सौदा हो जाता है। लेकिन, ऐसे भी लोग हैं जो सच्ची मित्रता निभाते हैं, अपनी गलतियों पर लौट कर सॉरी कहते हैं - ऐसे इंसान को कभी मत खोइए। 💔➡️❤️ इस शॉर्ट वीडियो में हम बताएंगे कि प्रेम में इंतजार क्यों जरूरी है और कैसे एक गहरा इंतजार आपके प्रेम को और भी मजबूत कर सकता है। 🕰️❤️ और याद रखिए, हर बुरे समय के बाद एक अच्छा समय जरूर आता है। धैर्य रखें और सुख के समय को अपनाएं! 🌈🤗 🔔 अगर आपको हमारे विचार पसंद आए तो कृपया इस वीडियो को LIKE 👍 करें, COMMENT 💬 करके अपने विचार साझा करें, और हमारे चैनल 'PahalPix' को SUBSCRIBE करना न भूलें! 👇 हमारे नए वीडियोस के नोटिफिकेशन के लिए घंटी 🔔 के बटन को दबाएं और #PahalPix परिवार का हिस्सा बने रहें! 👇 #वफादारी #प्रेममेंइंतजार #रिश्तोंकासच #PahalPix #रिश्ते #इंतजार #धैर्य #सच्चाप्यार #यूट्यूबशॉर्ट्स #दोस्ती #माफी #जीवनसाथी #साथी #LOVE #PATIENCE #RELATIONSHIPS #COMMITMENT #TRUEFRIENDS #LIFETIME #INSPIRATION #यूट्यूबइंडिया #SUBSCRIBE #LIKE #COMMENT 🌟🙏 आपका दिन शुभ हो! वीडियो देखने के लिए धन्यवाद! 🙏🌟 Hashtags: #रिश्ते #प्रेम #धैर्य #PahalPix #वफादारी #इंतजार #सच्चाप्यार #यूट्यूबशॉर्ट्स #सकारात्मकता #यूट्यूबकम्युनिटी #सफलताकीकहानी #जीवनकेअनुभव #जीवनकीसीख Remember to use a vibrant thumbnail that captures the essence of your video and choose an engaging video title to attract more viewers.

He was also known for not shying away from controversial topics while using strong language. The following monologue is an attempt to capture his style and perspective concerning the Alt-Right as a fictional exercise.] So I’ve been thinking a lot lately—always a dangerous thing—and it turns out there’s this new club in town. They call themselves the Alt-Right. Now, when I hear the word “alt,” I think of an alternative rock band or maybe a button on a keyboard that, let's face it, nobody really knows what the hell it does. But the Alt-Right, these guys, they’ve taken the word “alternate” to a whole new level. They're like an alternate reality where common sense went to die and take a long nap. Now let's break it down, because with a name like Alt-Right, you expect some sort of a software update for your political beliefs. But the only update these guys have is a patch for their hate software, and let me tell ya—it's full of bugs! They've taken the idea of being conservative and thought, \\"Hey, how do we sprinkle in a little bit of that 1940s fascist charm?\\" It’s like they're going for retro hate—vintage oppression with a modern twist. And you know, they love to talk about preserving Western culture. But when these fellas say, \\"Western culture,\\" they ain't talkin' about jazz, democracy, or landing on the moon. They're talking about a \\"white's-only\\" sign at the country club swimming pool. It's like they missed the part of Western culture that's about progress and understanding, and instead, they cherry-picked the worst hits of the last millennium and put them on repeat. I mean, these guys strap themselves in the ideological harness of \\"saving civilization.\\" Well, if the civilization you're saving says you can't share a bus seat or a water fountain with someone because of the color of their skin, then maybe—just maybe—you're not the hero in this version of the game. You see, they've got this mascot that they love to dress up as, this Pepe the Frog. A frog! I guess it makes sense because, after spending so much time spewing their stuff on the internet, their skin must be all clammy and pale from never seeing sunlight. Plus, they need to live in a swamp to feel at home. Frogs, swamps, it all comes together! And the Alt-Right, oh, they worship at the altar of free speech—there's nothing they cherish more, they say. But if you so much as whisper a word of disagreement, well then, you’re oppressing them, you're part of the problem; you're the man keeping them down. Isn't it funny how the champions of free speech get so flustered when the speech doesn't sound like an echo? But let's not forget, folks—the Alt-Right says they're not racist, no no, they're \\"racial realists.\\" Isn't that a beautiful term? \\"Racial realists.\\" It’s kind of like saying you're not a garbage man, you're a \\"sanitation engineer.\\" Or you're not a drug dealer, you're a \\"pharmaceutical entrepreneur.\\" I tell ya, if putting lipstick on a pig made it attractive, the Alt-Right would be hosting beauty pageants left and right. In the end, the Alt-Right spends so much time living in the past, you'd think they'd at least have the decency to invent a time machine. But why do that when you can try to turn back the clock by yelling at it? That's right, folks—they're like the guy who thinks his TV will work better if he just hits it harder. And let me tell ya, there’s no shortage of folks willing to hand them the hammer. Yeah, the Alt-Right... taking the 'right' turn so far, they circled back to the times we thought we left in the history books. History, they say, repeats itself. But for these guys, it’s less of a repetition and more like a rerun because their ideas are about as fresh as last week's meatloaf. But hey, it's a free country, right? Everyone's entitled to believe what they want. So in the spirit of fairness, I'll keep my mind open to the Alt-Right... just as soon as they pry it from the tight, cold fingers of reason."},{"prompt":"write an article about Kindergarten's choir practice","completion":"Kindergarten's Choir Practice: Fostering Musicality and Creativity Kindergarten is an incredible time in a child's life, filled with exploration, new experiences, and friendships. In addition to learning essential academic skills, this is also the perfect time to introduce young minds to the wonders of music. One activity that often stands out during these formative years is the kindergarten choir practice. These practices not only promote musicality but also offer numerous benefits for overall child development. Choir practice for kindergarteners is far more than just singing songs. It is a carefully crafted platform where children learn to explore their voices, develop confidence, collaborate effectively, and express themselves creatively. Let us delve into some of the fantastic aspects of kindergarten choir practices. Firstly, the choir serves as a gateway for children to discover their own unique voice. During practice sessions, kids are taught the importance of good vocal techniques such as proper breathing, projection, and clarity. These foundations pave the way for future musical growth and ensure that children develop healthy vocal habits right from the beginning. Moreover, through singing, kindergarteners learn about different melodies, harmonies, and rhythms, laying the groundwork for their future musical understanding. Secondly, choir practice offers an environment that boosts confidence and self-esteem in kindergarteners. As they perform in front of their peers, teachers, and sometimes even parents, children learn to embrace their own abilities and talents. This experience instills a sense of accomplishment and builds their self-assurance. Singing as part of a group provides a unique opportunity to collaborate with others, teaching children valuable social skills such as listening, taking turns, and respecting each other's contributions. Furthermore, kindergarten choir practice actively fosters creativity and imagination. Children are exposed to a diverse range of songs from various genres, cultures, and languages, expanding their musical repertoire. These experiences stimulate their curiosity, nurtures creativity, and encourages them to think outside the box when it comes to their own musical expression. Teachers often incorporate movement and gestures into the choir performances, allowing kindergarteners to explore different ways of expressing emotions through their body language. Additionally, these choir practices enhance children's concentration and memory skills. Learning songs, remembering lyrics, and coordinating movements require focus and practice. Through repetition and rehearsal, kindergarteners develop their ability to concentrate for longer periods of time, improving their attention span, which is an essential life skill that extends beyond the realm of music. Lastly, the joy and excitement that radiate from kindergarteners during choir performances are truly remarkable. These events create a sense of community and pride among children, their families, and the school. They provide an opportunity for parents and guardians to witness the progress their little ones have made, promoting a strong connection between school and home. The pride children feel after performing on stage reinforces a positive attitude towards music, fostering a lifelong love for this art form. In conclusion, kindergarten choir practice is an integral part of early childhood education, offering a myriad of benefits for young learners. By nurturing musicality, self-expression, creativity, and social skills, choir practices provide a holistic approach to children's development. The joy and confidence gained through these experiences will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact on kindergarteners, paving the way for a brighter future filled with a deep appreciation for the world of music."},{"prompt":"translate it into mandarin","completion":"幼儿园合唱排练：培养音乐才华与创造力 幼儿园时期是孩子生命中令人难以置信的阶段，充满着探索、新的体验和友谊。除了学习基本学术技能外，这也是介绍年幼心灵音乐奇妙之处的绝佳时机。在这些重要的年龄里，幼儿园合唱排练是一项引人注目的活动。这些排练不仅促进音乐能力，还为整体儿童发展带来了许多益处。 幼儿园合唱排练远非仅仅是唱歌。它是一个精心打造的平台，孩子们可以在其中探索自己的声音、培养自信心、有效合作并创造性地表达自己。让我们深入了解幼儿园合唱排练的一些精彩之处。 首先，合唱团为孩子们发现自己独特的声音提供了一个途径。在练习中，孩子们将学习正确的呼吸、投射和清晰度等良好的声乐技巧的重要性。这些基础为未来的音乐发展铺平了道路，并确保孩子们从一开始就培养出健康的声乐习惯。此外，通过唱歌，幼儿园生们学习不同的旋律、和声和节奏，为他们未来的音乐理解打下基础。 其次，合唱排练为幼儿园生们提供了一个增强自信心和自尊心的环境。当他们在同伴、老师甚至是父母面前表演时，孩子们学会接受自己的能力和才华。这种经历给予了他们一种成就感，并建立了他们的自信心。与他人一起唱歌提供了与人合作的独特机会，教会孩子们宝贵的社交技巧，例如倾听、轮流发言和尊重彼此的贡献。 此外，幼儿园合唱排练积极促进创造力和想象力。孩子们接触到各种不同流派、文化和语言的歌曲，扩大他们的音乐库。这些经历激发他们的好奇心，培养创造力，并鼓励他们在自己的音乐表达中有独特的思维方式。老师们通常将身体动作和手势融入到合唱表演中，让幼儿们通过肢体语言探索不同的情感表达方式。 此外，这些合唱排练增强了孩子们的注意力和记忆力。学习歌曲、记忆歌词和协调动作需要专注和练习。通过重复和排练，幼儿们能够集中注意力更长的时间，提高他们的专注力，这是超越音乐领域的重要生活技能。 最后，幼儿园合唱排练带来的喜悦和激动令人难以置信。这些活动在学生、家庭和学校之间建立了一种社群感和自豪感。它们为父母和监护人提供了观察他们孩子取得进步的机会，促进学校和家庭之间的紧密联系。在上台表演后，孩子们所感受到的自豪感强化了他们对音乐的积极态度，培养了对这门艺术形式的终身热爱。 总之，幼儿园合唱排练是幼儿教育中不可或缺的一部分，为年幼学习者提供了无数益处。通过培养音乐性、自我表达、创造力和社交技能，合唱排练为儿童的全面发展提供了全面的方法。通过这些经历获得的喜悦与自信将无疑对幼儿产生持久的影响，为他们铺平道路，拥有对音乐世界的深深赞赏。"},{"prompt":"请介绍儿童合唱课教学乐理的活动，我们用了杯子展示音阶的高低，也用钢琴帮小朋友测试和培养音准","completion":"儿童合唱课教学乐理的活动是一种有趣且有效的方式，帮助孩子们理解和学习音乐基础知识。其中包括使用杯子展示音阶的高低以及使用钢琴帮助测试和培养音准。 首先，通过使用杯子展示音阶的高低，可以帮助孩子们直观地理解不同音符之间的音高差异。在这个活动中，老师可以准备一系列大小不同的杯子，用来代表不同的音符。然后，将这些杯子按照升降阶梯排列，较大的杯子代表较低的音符，较小的杯子代表较高的音符。通过演示、比较和互动，孩子们可以直观地看到音符的高低变化，从而加深他们对音阶的理解和记忆。 其次，使用钢琴进行音准测试和培养是培养孩子们准确演唱音高的重要活动。在这个活动中，老师可以使用钢琴弹奏一段简单的旋律或音阶，然后要求孩子们尝试跟随钢琴的音高演唱。通过这种方式，孩子们得到了直接的反馈，可以听到正确的音高，并修正自己的演唱。随着练习的进行，孩子们的音准观念将得到改善，同时也提高了他们对音调和旋律的敏感度。 这些活动不仅仅是为孩子们提供了直观的音乐体验，还可以激发他们的兴趣，并帮助他们建立良好的音乐基础。通过参与儿童合唱课教学乐理的这些活动，孩子们能够更深入地了解音乐，培养自己的音感和音准，并为未来在合唱团中演唱高质量的音乐做好准备。"},{"prompt":"概述孩子学习乐理的重要性","completion":"学习乐理对儿童的音乐发展非常重要。乐理是音乐的基础知识，涉及音符、节奏、音阶、和弦、调式等概念。以下是总结乐理学习对孩子的重要性的几个关键点： 1. 培养音乐理解能力：乐理教育帮助孩子们理解音乐的构成和结构，让他们能够更好地解读音乐作品。了解音符、音阶和和弦等基本概念，使孩子能够分析和识别不同的音乐元素，从而提高他们对音乐的理解能力。 2. 创造音乐：乐理知识为孩子们创作自己的音乐提供了基础。通过学习乐理，他们可以了解音乐的规则和结构，掌握节奏和和声的技巧，并在此基础上创作出属于自己的音乐作品。这样的创造力培养不仅丰富了孩子的艺术表达能力，也有助于培养他们的创造力和想象力。 3. 增强技巧和表演能力：乐理知识对孩子们的演奏和表演技能非常关键。了解音符的价值、节奏的排列和音阶的顺序，可以帮助孩子们在演奏乐器或唱歌时更准确地表达音乐意图。此外，乐理还有助于孩子们正确地解读乐谱，掌握音乐演奏中的要点，从而提高他们的演奏技巧和表演能力。 4. 加强认知和数学能力：学习乐理涉及音符的记忆、节奏的处理和音阶的理解等，这些过程锻炼了孩子的记忆和认知能力。此外，乐理中的节奏和计数也涉及数学概念，例如拍子、节拍和分数。通过与音乐的结合，乐理学习可以帮助孩子们提高数学思维和数学概念的理解能力。 总之，学习乐理对儿童音乐发展至关重要。它培养了孩子们对音乐的理解和创造能力，提高了他们的演奏和表演技巧，加强了记忆和认知能力，同时也促进了他们的数学思维。通过乐理学习，孩子们能够更全面地投入到音乐世界中，并获得持久的音乐素养。"},{"prompt":"Write a week description for kindergarten’s music class, theme in Canton culture, each year level had the following activities: PN: read a Cantonese story about dinosaur going to school, this story can teach children good habit.

People who look at a piece of art, and the first thing they do is squint their eyes and stroke their chins like they’re trying to read the mind of a flea and say, “Hmmm, but was it made by a human or an AI?\\" Because, apparently, now that’s all that matters. I mean, here we are, in the 21st century, where you've got computers that can paint, write, and even compose symphonies. Machines cranking out sonnets, landscapes, and portraits, and all the while, there’s a cluster of humans banging on the gallery doors yelling, “This isn’t real art!” Yeah, real artists, they call themselves. Like they squeeze their paint out of the tubes with more soul or something. Like every stroke of their brush is imbued with the spirit of Picasso’s ghost doing the Macarena. Please. These are the same people who probably would have protested the printing press. “Books written by hand have more essence, Gutenberg! Your fancy machine lacks the tender touch of a scribe's crippling carpal tunnel syndrome!” And it’s funny, isn't it? How we tread this fear of being replaced. Like these anti-AI folks who cling to their canvas as if it's a life raft and every computer-generated image is a wave trying to throw them off the art scene. You see, art, for the longest time, was this human thing, right? A sacred space where we could express our deepest emotions, explore our inner worlds. But suddenly, here comes the AI, slipping into the gallery like it’s sneaking into an R-rated movie, completely unapologetic, and people are up in arms because what? It didn’t suffer enough for its art? “They’re stealing our jobs!” they cry. Stealing your jobs? Buddy, listen, the moment you can program a machine to feel the existential dread of a blank canvas or the thrill of a sold-out exhibition, then we’ll talk about job theft, okay? But until then, let’s not pretend this is about preserving some sort of human purity in art. It’s about ego. Because now, it's not just the artist in the next studio who might be better than you; it’s a box of wires and code that doesn’t even need to stop for coffee breaks. Artificial Intelligence is just the latest easy target for people looking for something to blame because they didn’t get a ribbon at the art fair this year. But guess what, my friends? It doesn’t matter whether a painting was made by a hand holding a brush or by a robotic arm executing an algorithm, the question is: does it make you feel something? And if it does, then who cares if the artist behind it is made of flesh or silicon? But hey, if we need to keep these anti-AI artists’ egos from shattering like a dropped vase, then maybe we should make our computers paint with their off hand, or with a stutter in their processing unit – you know, just to even the playing field. Let art be art, I say. Once we start drawing lines, deciding who gets to create and who doesn't, we might as well toss creativity out the window and call it day. Because in the end, whether it's Schubert's Symphony or some AI that composed it while multi-tasking a thousand other symphonies, I'll tell you one thing – it's all just a bunch of notes until somebody listens.

Вот некоторые из основных понятий: 1. Туризм: Туризм — это социально-экономическая и культурная явление, которое связано с перемещением людей из их обычного окружения в другие места вне их постоянного места проживания с целями отдыха, бизнеса и другими целями, которые не связаны с осуществлением деятельности, оплачиваемой в месте посещения. Это широкая отрасль, включающая в себя туристические услуги, гостиничный бизнес, питание, развлечения, транспорт и др. 2. Объект управления в туризме: Объект управления — это та сфера или элемент системы управления, к которому непосредственно применяются управленческие действия. В сфере туризма объектами управления могут быть туристические компании, отели, курорты, достопримечательности, турпродукты и так далее. В более широком смысле объектом управления в туризме могут быть туристическая индустрия в целом или её отдельные подсектора. 3. Субъект управления в туризме: Субъект управления — это лицо или организация, которые осуществляют управленческий процесс. В случае туризма это могут быть менеджеры туристических компаний, органы государственного управления туризмом, ассоциации и союзы в области туризма, туристические операторы и агентства, а также некоммерческие организации, работающие в области развития туризма. Управление туризмом включает планирование, организацию, координацию, контроль и анализ различных видов деятельности, связанных с туристической индустрией, в целях удовлетворения потребностей туристов и достижения экономических, социальных и экологических целей. Управление может быть направлено как на внутренний рынок (домашний туризм), так и на международный туристический рынок."},{"prompt":"Структура управления туризмом","completion":"Структура управления туризмом может быть разнообразной и зависеть от ряда факторов, включая масштабы и характер туристической деятельности, законодательную базу конкретной страны или региона, а также от целей и задач, поставленных перед управляющими субъектами. В общих чертах структура управления туризмом может включать следующие элементы: 1. Государственные органы управления туризмом: Во многих странах существуют центральные и региональные правительственные структуры, которые отвечают за формирование туристической политики, разработку нормативной базы, координацию различных програм и проектов в сфере туризма. Это могут быть министерства туризма, национальные туристические ведомства, региональные департаменты туризма и т.д. 2. Профессиональные и отраслевые ассоциации: Такие организации представляют интересы различных секторов туристической индустрии, включая отельный бизнес, туристическое агентство, транспортные компании и другие участников рынка. Они могут влиять на процесс разработки политики и стандартов в отрасли, проводить образовательные программы и предоставлять поддержку своим членам. 3. Туристические компании и предприятия: Управление на уровне предприятий включает в себя туристические агентства, гостиницы, туроператоры, средства размещения, места развлечений и отдыха и т.д. Они занимаются практическим управлением туризмом, в том числе разработкой турпродуктов, маркетингом, продажами и обслуживанием клиентов. 4. Некоммерческие и неправительственные организации (НКО и НПО): Такие организации могут играть важную роль в устойчивом развитии туризма, защите интересов местных сообществ, сохранении культурного наследия и улучшении экологической ситуации. Они могут участвовать в разработке и реализации социально значимых проектов и инициатив, проведении исследований и образовательной работы. 5. Локальные сообщества и население: Уровень местных сообществ ассоциируется с управлением на уровне городов, муниципалитетов, включая местные администрации и самоорганизованные сообщества жителей, которые могут участвовать в планировании туристического развития, создании и продвижении местных туристических продуктов и услуг. Важно отметить, что структура управления туризмом требует эффективной координации между всеми этими уровнями и субъектами, что требует наличия четких стратегических планов развития, действенных коммуникационных каналов и системы обратной связи для адекватного ответа на вызовы и изменения в отрасли."},{"prompt":"3. Миссия и цели деятельности туристского предприятия","completion":"Миссия и цели туристского предприятия являются ключевыми элементами, которые определяют его стратегическое направление и помогают сфокусировать его ресурсы на достижении конкретных результатов. Для успешного развития и эффективной работы предприятию важно чётко определить как миссию, так и цели своей деятельности. Миссия туристского предприятия: Миссия описывает основную суть и предназначение компании, её ключевые ценности и то, чем она стремится быть для своих клиентов, сотрудников, партнёров и общества в целом. Это заявление должно отражать уникальные особенности предприятия и быть вдохновляющим. Пример миссии для туристической компании может выглядеть так: \\"Доставлять незабываемые впечатления и эмоции нашим клиентам, обеспечивая высокий уровень сервиса и индивидуальный подход, способствуя развитию устойчивого туризма и позитивного взаимодействия с культурами и природой в местах нашего присутствия\\". Цели деятельности туристского предприятия: Цели представляют собой конкретные, измеримые и реалистичные задачи, которые предприятие стремится достичь в определённые сроки. Цели могут касаться различных аспектов бизнеса, включая рост доходов, расширение рынка, повышение уровня удовлетворенности клиентов, развитие продуктов, улучшение внутренних процессов, устойчивость и социальная ответственность. Примеры целей для туристической компании: 1. Увеличить объем продаж на 20% в следующем финансовом году за счёт внедрения новых туристических пакетов и усиления маркетинговых усилий. 2. Расширить рынки сбыта, войдя в топ-5 туристических операторов в странах Латинской Америки за два года. 3. Достигнуть 90% уровня удовлетворенности клиентов, оптимизировав процесс бронирования и введя программу лояльности. 4. Запустить три новых экологических тура и два социальных проекта в поддержку местных сообществ за следующий год. 5. Сократить углеродный след компании на 15% за три года через оптимизацию маршрутов и использование экологичных транспортных средств. Цели и миссия должны быть связаны: миссия даёт общее направление, а цели определяют конкретные шаги для её реализации. Вместе они помогают сформировать стратегический план развития предприятия и служат ориентиром для принятия управленческих решений на всех уровнях организации."},{"prompt":"Организационная структура управления туристским предприятием: виды организационных структур и их характеристика.","completion":"Организационная структура управления туристским предприятием определяет распределение должностных обязанностей, иерархию власти и схему коммуникаций между сотрудниками и подразделениями. Существует несколько видов организационных структур, каждая из которых имеет свои особенности и подходит для разных условий ведения бизнеса. 1. Линейная организационная структура: Это одна из самых старых и простых форм управления. Характеризуется чёткой иерархией, где каждый сотрудник подчиняется одному руководителю. Преимуществами являются простота управления, ясность команд и быстрота принятия решений. Однако она может быть менее эффективной в больших или разрастающихся организациях, где руководителям трудно управлять всеми аспектами бизнеса. 2. Функциональная организационная структура: В такой структуре компания разделена на отделы по типу выполняемых функций, например, маркетинг, продажи, финансы, персонал и т.д. Каждый отдел специализируется на своём деле, что повышает эффективность работы. Недостаток такой структуры может заключаться в сложности координации между отделами и возможности появления «барьеров» в коммуникации. 3. Дивизиональная организационная структура: Предприятия с дивизиональной структурой разделены на самостоятельные подразделения или дивизионы, которые могут функционировать как отдельные бизнес-единицы. Эти дивизионы обычно организованы вокруг продуктов, услуг, рынков или географических регионов. Каждый дивизион имеет своё управление и часто включает все необходимые функции (например, свой собственный маркетинг, продажи и т.д.). 4. Матричная организационная структура: Матричная структура сочетает элементы функциональной и проектной структурирования. Сотрудники имеют двойное подчинение: и своему функциональному руководителю, и менеджеру проекта. Это позволяет использовать ресурсы компании более гибко и эффективно, но может приводить к конфликтам из-за наличия двойного управления. 5. Сетевая организационная структура: Сетевая структура подразумевает, что основные функции предприятия выполняются централизованно, а другие операции аутсорсятся или распределяются между партнёрскими компаниями. Это увеличивает гибкость и возможность масштабирования бизнеса, но требует отличного управления связями и координации между внешними и внутренними структурами. 6. Гибкая (Flat) организационная структура: Гибкая или плоская структура характеризуется ограниченным количеством иерархических уровней. Коммуникация в такой структуре более демократична, и сотрудники часто имеют больше полномочий для принятия решений. Подходит для малых и средних предприятий, а также для организаций, работающих в быстро меняющихся отраслях. Выбор подходящей организационной структуры зависит от многих факторов, включая размер компании, её стратегию и цели, степень сложности бизнес-процессов и корпоративную культуру. Она должна обеспечить эффективное выполнение текущей деятельности и одновременно быть достаточно гибкой, чтобы адаптироваться к изменениям во внешней и внутренней среде."},{"prompt":"He fancies Julia.가 무슨뜻인가요?","completion":"\\"He fancies Julia\\" 라는 표현은 영국 영어에서 자주 사용되는데, \\"그는 줄리아를 마음에 들어한다\\" 또는 \\"그는 줄리아에게 호감을 가지고 있다\\"라는 뜻입니다. 여기서 \\"fancies\\"는 강한 친밀함이나 성적인 매력보다는 갖고 있는 경미한 호감이나 관심을 나타낼 때 사용됩니다."},{"prompt":"\\"He may drive her but me is a big no.\\" What is this meaning?","completion":"The phrase \\"He may drive her but me is a big no\\" is informal and somewhat incorrect grammatically.

When a Locker interacts with the nucleus, it aligns its energy fields with the atomic structure, creating an impregnable bond that bolsters the nucleus's stability. The locking process occurs through a complex interplay of quantum mechanics and elemental forces. As Lockers approach an atomic nucleus, they resonate with its innate energy signature, causing the particle to vibrate with ethereal vibrations. These vibrations cascade through the nucleus, fortifying its stability and reinforcing the binding forces between its constituent parts. Once locked, the nucleus becomes immune to external forces that might seek to destabilize it. The locked atomic structure gains remarkable strength, enabling it to resist both physical assaults and magical manipulations that could seek to alter its properties. This newfound stability may lead to extraordinary advancements in energy generation, as scientists envision harnessing the locked nuclei to create limitless power sources. However, the exact nature and behavior of Lockers remain shrouded in enigma. Researchers and magic practitioners across the realm stand in awe of their potential, yet the particles' scarcity and mysterious origins pose significant challenges to unlocking their full potential. Unlocking the secrets of Lockers may illuminate the nature of the universe itself, revealing the intricate dance between science and magic and unravelling the fundamental truth that binds all existence."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They're out there stomping their feet, screaming at the cloud—no, not that cloud with data, the other one, the one that doesn't listen—yelling, \\"AI art is theft!\\" And I'm standing here, scratching my head, trying to figure out who exactly got robbed. I mean, last time I checked, art was about expression, creativity, breaking rules—not setting up a neighborhood watch for the imagination. Let me lay it out for you: we've got these anti-AI artists, right? They've got their berets screwed on so tight their ideas can't circulate. They cling to their paintbrushes like lifelines as if the very essence of artistry was under siege by an army of soulless algorithms. \\"AI is stealing our jobs!\\" they holler from the rooftops, rallying against the machines like a digital-age lynch mob. \\"It's thievery! It's blasphemy!\\" You'd think the Sistine Chapel got tagged with spray paint the way they carry on. But what is art, my friends? Isn't it the ultimate act of taking something that exists—be it a thought, an emotion, a taco—and twisting it, shaping it into something new, something we can stare at or listen to, and say, \\"Hey, that's something!\\" And these anti-AI artist types, they're like the folks who said the camera would kill painting. \\"Oh no,\\" they wailed, \\"now anyone can click a button and make a picture; what's going to become of us real artists?\\" Well, guess what? Last time I checked, the Louvre wasn't swapping out Mona Lisa's smile for a selfie. Let's break it down. AI art—what is it, really? It's collaboration, man. An artist feeds their vision into a machine like tossing a coin into a well, making a wish, and out comes something they couldn't have done alone. It's like being a magician's assistant, except you don't have to wear the sequins unless you want to. Now, these anti-AI folks, they're waving the \\"AI art is theft\\" banner like they're charging into battle. But who's the victim here? Did AI sneak into the Louvre and replace the paintings with NFTs? Did it tie up the artist in the back room and rifle through their color palette? Art is about pushing boundaries, not building walls. It's supposed to be about what's possible, not what's permissible. If you're telling me that using AI is theft, then what about using a camera? What about using Photoshop? Hell, what about using a ruler to draw a straight line? Was art pure and theft-free when we were finger-painting on cave walls? Here's the punchline: art evolves. And those who don't evolve with it, they end up painting themselves into a very tight, very lonely corner. But hey, don't mind me; I'm just a guy who thinks for a living, trying to poke holes in the hot air balloons of the sanctimonious. So to the anti-AI artists clutching their pearls and their palettes, I say, \\"Lighten up.\\" Embrace the machine, make it your partner-in-crime. Because in the end, it's not about how the art is made; it's about the story it tells and the eyes that can't look away. And if an artist and a bundle of wires and code can make that happen, I say, let there be art. Let it spill out onto the streets, let it flood the galleries, let it rain down in pixels and paint drops. Because, when you get right down to it, the only true theft in art is not allowing it to be everything it can be."},{"prompt":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (It was just another day in Mondstadt.

**葡萄糖发酵**：阳性。培养基底部的斜面呈现黄色。 - **乳糖发酵**：阳性。全培养基均呈现黄色，表明乳糖和葡萄糖都被发酵。 - **H2S产生**：阴性，培养基中无黑色沉淀产生。 - **气体产生**：阳性，可能会在琼脂中看到气泡或裂纹。 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - **葡萄糖发酵**：阳性。培养基底部的斜面呈现黄色。 - **乳糖发酵**：阴性。斜面呈黄色而上层仍为红色或粉红色，表明只有葡萄糖发酵。 - **H2S产生**：阴性，培养基中无黑色沉淀产生。 - **气体产生**：阴性，大部分Shigella属细菌不产生气体。 # MIU试验（鸟苷酸酶、吲哚、尿素试验）结果： **大肠杆菌（E. coli）**: - **运动性**：阳性，表现为从接种点向四周扩散。 - **吲哚产生**：阳性，大肠杆菌能将色氨酸转变为吲哚。 - **尿素酶活性**：阴性，大肠杆菌不具有分解尿素的能力。 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - **运动性**：阴性，Shigella属细菌通常不具有运动性。 - **吲哚产生**：阴性，Shigella属细菌通常不能将色氨酸转变为吲哚。 - **尿素酶活性**：阴性，Shigella属细菌不具有分解尿素的能力。 # OF（氧化发酵）试验结果： **大肠杆菌（E. coli）**: - 在油封环境下（发酵条件）和空气存在下（氧化条件）都能使培养基由绿色转变为黄色，表明E. coli是一种兼性厌氧菌，能在有氧和无氧条件下都发酵糖类。 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - 同样，在油封环境下（发酵条件）下能将培养基由绿色转变为黄色，但在有氧条件下通常不呈黄色或颜色变化较慢，这表明Shigella是一种兼性厌氧菌，主要通过发酵途径产生能量。 # 氧化酶试验结果： **大肠杆菌（E. coli）** 与 **痢疾杆菌（Shigella spp.）**: - 均为阴性。肠杆菌科的细菌一般不具有氧化酶活性。 通过上述的生化试验结果，我们可以有效地区分大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌，在临床实验室中这些试验是常规用于肠道细菌鉴定的方法。大肠杆菌的乳糖和葡萄糖发酵能力、吲哚正反应以及运动性是与痢疾杆菌鉴别的关键特征。这些生化特征相结合可以帮助临床微生物学家确认患者体内的病原体种类，从而为治疗提供指导。"},{"prompt":"请基于以上的所有内容生成该病历的实验讨论内容部分，要求越详细越好","completion":"在本病历中，患者出现腹痛、腹泻、畏寒发热等症状，这些都是胃肠道感染的典型临床表现。根据这些症状，细菌性肠道病原体，如大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌，是可能的致病因素。为了准确鉴定导致患者症状的特定病原菌，本研究采用了一系列生化测试包括KIA试验、MIU试验、OF试验以及氧化酶试验。 # KIA试验讨论 通过KIA试验，我们观察到葡萄糖发酵均为阳性，这是预期结果，因为绝大多数肠道细菌都能够发酵葡萄糖。大肠杆菌显示出乳糖的发酵能力，将全培养基变为黄色，而痢疾杆菌则表现为乳糖发酵阴性。此外，大肠杆菌产生了气体，说明其具有一定的发酵能力，而痢疾杆菌没有气体产生。两者均未产生H2S，这与它们的预期生化特性一致。 # MIU试验讨论 在MIU试验中，我们看到了大肠杆菌的运动性和其对色氨酸的代谢能力（通过吲哚测试阳性证明），而这些特性在痢疾杆菌中并不存在。两者均未展示尿素酶活性，因此我们无法仅根据这个标准来区分这两种细菌。 # OF试验讨论 OF试验显示，大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌均能在无氧（油封）条件下利用糖类进行发酵。然而，仅在有氧条件下，大肠杆菌展现了更强的代谢活力，使得整个培养基变黄，而痢疾杆菌在有氧条件下的代谢活动较弱。这样的差异表明，虽然两者都是兼性厌氧菌，大肠杆菌的代谢路径更加灵活。 # 氧化酶试验讨论 在本病历中，氧化酶的测试结果对于区分大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌并不具有明确的指示性，因为两者均为阴性，这与肠杆菌科细菌的一般特征相符合。 # 综合讨论 基于上述生化测试结果，我们可以得出以下结论。首先，KIA和MIU试验提供了鉴别大肠杆菌和痢疾杆菌的有力依据。大肠杆菌的运动性、能够发酵乳糖以及产生吲哚的特性为其诊断提供了关键线索。痢疾杆菌的符合预期的乳糖发酵阴性结果、不具备运动性和不产生吲哚能够帮助排除其他可能的病原体。 在临床设置中，这些实验结果非常有助于医生对于患者的病原体进行初步判断，并确定更为针对性的治疗方法。最终，为了确保病原体鉴定的准确性，推荐进一步进行分子生物学检测，如PCR或基因测序，以及足够的血清学测试以确定特定的细菌菌株或血清型。这些进一步的测试可以为治疗决策和公共卫生干预提供更详细的信息。"},{"prompt":"大分生袍子","completion":"\\"大分生袍子\\"这一名称似乎可能是由于拼写错误或翻译不精确所导致的。在生物学领域中，并不存在明确被称为“大分生袍子”的术语或生物分类。 如果您想要询问有关生物学中的某个特定术语或者生物分类，如 \\"大型真菌\\" 或者 \\"子囊菌\\"（Ascomycetes）等，这些是一个广泛的生物分类群，也是在真菌界中的一个门（phylum）级别的分类，请您提供更多的上下文或者确切的术语，以便我能够提供准确的解释和相关信息。 如果您是在询问有关袍子类动物（Tunicata），这是一类海洋无脊椎动物，属于脊索动物亚门，与陆生脊椎动物较远亲缘关系，也请指明。请提供更多详细信息，以便我能更好地帮助您。"},{"prompt":"list of action kids anime","completion":"There are numerous action-packed kids anime series that combine elements of adventure, fantasy, and sometimes sci-fi genres to captivate younger audiences with fast-paced narratives and vibrant animation.

Социальные гарантии относятся к правам и привилегиям, которые государство или работодатель предоставляют гражданам или работникам в рамках системы социального регулирования. Они обеспечивают основные социальные услуги и льготы, такие как образование, здравоохранение, пенсии, пособия по безработице, социальная помощь и т.д. Социальные гарантии защищают граждан от неблагоприятных обстоятельств, обеспечивают достойные условия жизни и защиту их социальных прав. Социальное обеспечение, на другую сторону, является системой обязательных страховых программ, которые государство организует для граждан в рамках социальной защиты и поддержки. Оно обеспечивается путем взносов, уплачиваемых работодателями и работниками, и предлагает защиту от определенных рисков и социальных потребностей, таких как страхование от несчастных случаев, страхование по безработице, страхование от болезней и т.д. Социальное обеспечение обеспечивает финансовую поддержку при наступлении определенных событий или столкновении с социальными рисками. Ключевая разница между социальными гарантиями и социальным обеспечением заключается в том, что социальные гарантии являются гарантированными правами и привилегиями, предоставляемыми государством, а социальное обеспечение основывается на системе обязательного страхования, где граждане вносят взносы, чтобы получить финансовую поддержку в соответствии с установленными правилами и условиями."},{"prompt":"Основание власти в менеджменте","completion":"Основание власти в менеджменте относится к способу, которым менеджеры получают свою власть и влияют на других сотрудников в рамках организации. Основание власти может быть разделено на несколько типов: 1. Власть по должности (формальная власть): этот тип власти основан на должности или роли, которую занимает менеджер в структуре организации. Такая власть дается посредством назначения на определенную позицию в иерархии и обычно включает в себя право принимать решения, давать указания и контролировать работу подчиненных. 2. Экспертная власть: такая власть основана на знаниях, опыте и специальных навыках менеджера. Люди признают экспертность и авторитет менеджера в определенной области и поэтому готовы следовать его рекомендациям и указаниям. 3. Привлекательность (власть, основанная на личных качествах): некоторые менеджеры обладают привлекательностью и харизмой, которые позволяют им влиять на других людей. Этот тип власти основан на личном обаянии, убеждениях и умении вдохновлять и мотивировать других. 4. Ресурсная власть: такая власть основывается на доступных ресурсах или возможности воздействия на них. Например, менеджер, контролирующий финансовые ресурсы, может использовать эту власть для влияния на других сотрудников. 5. Информационная власть: этот тип власти основан на доступе к важной информации или контроле над информацией, которая требуется другим сотрудникам для успешного выполнения задач. В реальности менеджеры часто используют комбинацию различных типов основания власти в зависимости от конкретной ситуации и контекста.

It was the weekend, and everyone gathered at their house for a special dinner. The table was well decorated with streamers, candles, and plenty of delicious food. As the dinner began, the family roared with joy and happiness. However, there was a little disagreement between the siblings. They couldn't seem to agree on which snack they should have before the meal. One wanted a salad, while the other preferred a lemonade. Their parents, well aware of the conflict, decided to contribute a solution. Instead of arguing further, they suggested having both snacks, which made the kids identify a similar taste they liked. With their dislike of arguing, the kids quickly moved on and focused on the main course. The dinner was a feast, and everyone thoughtless enjoyed the meal. The company of their loved ones made the celebration even more special. After dinner, it was time for a surprise. The parents had planned a contest where the kids had to find clues hidden around the house. The narrator of the contest was their grandmother, known for her fables and stories. As the kids searched the house for clues, they began to visualize the connection between the clues, just as their grandmother had advised. The story of the fable guided them to a strange painting in the garden. Excitedly, they peeled the painting off to find a secret door. With a breeze of anticipation, they opened the door and found a room filled with toys and gifts. The room was the size of a small kingdom, and it looked like something out of their wildest dreams. The kids couldn't believe their eyes; they had never seen such a wonderful surprise. The celebration had turned into an extraordinary experience that affected their attitude positively. The worries of the day were washed away and replaced with pure joy and excitement. It was a weekend they would never forget. Story 2: The Visualize Contest In a busy city, a school decided to organize a contest for their 4th-grade students. The goal was to visualize their favorite genre of book by using various materials. The students had a week to complete their projects and present them to the crowd at a special assembly. One student, named Emily, chose the genre of fables. She loved the characters and moral lessons in those stories. With great focus, Emily started her project by creating a miniature farm with animals made of foam. Each animal had a distinct character, and Emily made sure they looked as close as possible to the ones in the fables she had read. Emily’s choice of genre surprised her classmates, who had all picked fantasy or adventure. However, she remained sure of her idea and continued to work on her project with a positive attitude. She didn't worry about what others thought; her connection to fables was strong. Whenever Emily became stuck, she asked her teacher for guidance. Her teacher loaned her some fables books and encouraged her to read them for inspiration. Reading the stories helped Emily soak in more information and ideas for her project. As the week went by, Emily's project grew bigger and more impressive. She added a breeze maker that would blow gently, making the animals seem alive. The animals stood around a pond made of blue foam, where fable characters would reflect their thoughts and actions. On the day of the contest, the assembly hall was filled with excitement. Each student proudly presented their projects to the crowd. When it was Emily's turn, she confidently stood in front of the audience and explained her idea. With a voice full of enthusiasm and passion, Emily described how she wanted her project to make people reflect on their actions, just like the fables did for her. She wanted them to see that even in a busy city, the fragile moral lessons of fables could still shine through. As Emily unveiled her project, the crowd gasped. The visualized scene looked incredible. The miniature farm came to life with each animal placed strategically. Emily's hard work in capturing the essence of fable characters paid off. In the end, Emily's project won the contest. The crowd applauded, acknowledging her talent and dedication. She had proven that even in a genre that might seem strange to some, there was strength and beauty. The celebration of Emily's success continued throughout the day. She received plenty of positive feedback from her classmates and teachers. The contest had not only allowed her to showcase her creativity but also had given her a chance to shine. Emily's visualization contest victory taught her a valuable lesson. No matter how different or unique one's interests may be, they can always be celebrated and appreciated."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Производительность труда одного рабочего при изготовлении изделия А составляет 20 штук в день, а при изготовлении изделия В – 30 штук в день. Средние переменные издержки на производство изделия А равны 80 руб./шт., на выпуск изделия В – 100 руб./шт. Постоянные издержки мастерской не зависят от того, в каком соотношении выпускаются изделия А и В. Кривая дневного спроса на изделия вида А описывается функцией Q = 960 – 6P, где Q – объём продаж изделия А за день (в штуках), Р – цена изделия А (в рублях за штуку),а кривая дневного спроса на изделия В – функцией q = 3180 – 3p, где q – объём продаж изделия B за день (в штуках), p – цена изделия B (в рублях за штуку). Вся произведенная за день продукция реализуется в тот же день. Мастерская обеспечивает владельцу максимальную прибыль. Заполнить таблицу 1 Таблица 1 Показатели хозяйственной деятельности мастерской Решение: Путей решения этой задачи довольно много. Мы рассмотрим здесь один из них. Займёмся в первую очередь определением цены изделия А. Введём обозначения: х – число рабочих, занятых производством изделия А, чел., FС – постоянные издержки мастерской, руб. за день, Pr – прибыль мастерской, руб. за день. Тогда численность рабочих, занятых производством изделия В, составит (60 – х) чел., объём выпуска изделия А, определяемый как произведение количества занятых изготовлением этого изделия на их производительность труда, запишется в виде формулы Q = 20x, (1) а объём производства изделия В, по аналогии, – в виде формулы q = 30´ (60 – x); (2) дневная выручка от выпуска изделия А – это произведение Q´Р, а от выпуска изделия В – произведение q´р; переменные издержки на производство изделия А за день равны 80Q, а на производство изделия В – равны 100q. Следовательно, дневной объём прибыли мастерской, то есть разность между суммарной выручкой и совокупными издержками, выразится таким образом: Pr = Q´P + q´p – (80Q + 100q + FC). (3) Именно это функцию сводит к максимуму владелец мастерской. Неизвестная величина Q из функции (3) выражена через Р в условии задачи. Выразим через Р также переменные q и p. Начнём с того, что подставим заданную в условии функцию спроса на изделия вида А в (1): 960 – 6Р = 20х. Отсюда х = 48 – 0,3Р. Теперь, подставив полученное выражение для х в (2), имеем: q = 30´ (60 – 48 + 0,3P) = 360 + 9P. (4) Если далее подставить (4) в заданную в условии функцию спроса на изделия вида В, получим равенство 360 + 9Р = 3180 – 3р. Отсюда р = 940 – 3Р. (5) Наконец, подставив функцию спроса на изделия вида А, а также (4) и (5) в (3), запишем: PR = (960 – 6P) ´ P + (360 + 9P) ´ (940 – 3P) – 80 ´ ´ (960 – 6P) – –100´ (360 + 9P) – FC, откуда после элементарных, но громоздких, а потому требующих большой аккуратности преобразований получаем: Pr = – 33P² + 7920P + S – FC, (6) где S – константа. Для порядка можно уточнить: S = 360´940 – 80´960 – 100´360 = 225600. Однако для того, чтобы ответить на вопросы нашей задачи, значение этой величины знать не требуется и, строго говоря, его можно и не рассчитывать. График функции (6) – это парабола с ветвями, направленными вниз. Максимальному значению этой функции (то есть максимуму прибыли) соответствует вершина параболы, ордината которой (то есть оптимальная цена изделия А) составляет Найти остальные неизвестные в нашей задаче несложно. Цену изделия В определяем по формуле (5): р = 940 – 3´120 = 580 (руб./шт.). Дневной объём выпуска (и продаж) изделия А можно найти, используя соответствующую функцию спроса: Q = 960 – 6´120 = 240 (шт.), а объём выпуска изделия В – используя соотношение (4): q = 360 + 9´120 = 1440 (шт.). Значит, для изделия А переменные издержки за день составят 80´240 = 19200 (руб.), а выручка – 120´240 = 28800 (руб.). Аналогично, для изделия В переменные издержки равны 100´1440 = 144000 (руб.), а дневная выручка – 580´1440 = 835200 (руб.). Чтобы найти число рабочих, занятых выпуском изделия А, обратимся к формуле (1), из которой следует: Наконец, число рабочих, занятых выпуском изделия В, составит 60 – 12 = 48 (чел.). Таблица с занесёнными в неё ответами представлена ниже Задача 28 В мастерской, выпускающей деревянные ложки, на прямой сдельной оплате работают резчики по дереву и художники. Дневная выработка (в штуках) всех резчиков Q1 связана с расценкой за изготовление одной ложки (в рублях) V зависимостью Q1 = 460 + 50 V. Дневная выработка (в штуках) всех художников Q2 связана с расценкой за роспись одной ложки (в рублях) W зависимостью Q2 = 200 + 40 W. Средние переменные издержки на производство одной ложки за вычетом оплаты труда сдельщиков равны 3 рублям. Ложки продаются по 39,2 руб. за штуку. Все вырезанные за рабочий день ложки в тот же день и расписываются. Найти расценки труда сдельщиков, обеспечивающие владельцу мастерской наибольшую прибыль. Решение: Из условия задачи следует равенство Q1 = Q2 (за день расписывают столько же ложек, сколько вырезают), то есть 460 + 50 V = 200 +40 W. Отсюда W = 1,25 V + 6,5. (1) Поскольку средние переменные издержки на производство одной ложки равны (3 + V + W), обозначив постоянные издержки за рабочий день через FС, мы можем выписать формулу расчёта прибыли за рабочий день Pr, то есть того показателя, который владелец мастерской должен максимизировать: Pr = 39,2 Q1 - (3 + V + W )´Q1 - FС. (2) Подставляя в (2) выражение (1) и заданную в условии функцию, связывающую дневную выработку резчиков с расценкой за изготовление одной ложки, выпишем ещё раз функцию прибыли: Pr(V) = 39,2 ´ (460 + 50 V) - (3 + V + 1,25V +6,5) ´ (460 + 50 V) - FС. Элементарные преобразования приводят к выражению Pr(V) = - 112,5 V² + 450 V + 13662 - FС. Теперь ясно, что график полученной функции – это парабола с ветвями, направленными вниз, вершина которой, то есть точка максимума, имеет абсциссу Из формулы (1) получаем: W = 1,25´2 + 6,5 = 9 (руб./шт.). Ответ: Расценка для резчиков составляет 2 рубля за ложку; расценка для художников составляет 9 рублей за ложку. Задачи для самостоятельного решения В мастерской «Работяга» трудятся 60 рабочих, часть из которых занята выпуском изделия А, а остальные – производством изделия В. Производительность труда одного рабочего при изготовлении изделия А составляет 20 штук в день, а при изготовлении изделия В – 30 штук в день. Средние переменные издержки на производство изделия А равны 80 руб./шт., на выпуск изделия В – 100 руб./шт. Постоянные издержки мастерской не зависят от того, в каком соотношении выпускаются изделия А и В. Кривая дневного спроса на изделия вида А описывается функцией Q = 975 – 5P, где Q – объём продаж изделия А за день (в штуках), Р – цена изделия А (в рублях за штуку),а кривая дневного спроса на изделия В – функцией q = 3156 – 4p, где q – объём продаж изделия B за день (в штуках), p – цена изделия B (в рублях за штуку). Вся произведенная за день продукция реализуется в тот же день. Мастерская обеспечивает владельцу максимальную прибыль.

The optical axis of the camera is perpendicular to the wall and the lens centre is in the plane of the wall. The focal length of the lens is 35mm.

[4 marks] (ii) Can the corner A and B of the room to be detected by the camera? Justify your answer. [6 marks] (iii) Suggest the camera’s focal length in order to enable both corner A and B to be detected by the camera. [5 marks]","completion":"As an AI, I don't have the ability to view figures or images, including the one mentioned as \\"Figure 2.\\" Therefore, I'll provide a general explanation based on typical assumptions about similar problems. Please provide the necessary details if you need accurate and specific answers. (i) Without seeing Figure 2, I can't provide the coordinates for corners A and B. Coordinates would typically be given in a three-dimensional space described by (x, y, z) parameters, where the origin (0, 0, 0) could be the location of the camera sensor or another reference point in the room. (ii) Based on the typical setup where a surveillance camera's field of view is limited, the ability of the camera to detect corners A and B depends on several factors: - The field of view (FOV) of the lens, which is determined by the focal length and the size of the image sensor. - The position of the room's corners relative to the camera's position and optical axis. - The presence of any obstructions between the camera and the corners. Given a 35mm lens and assuming we are talking about a camera with a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm), one conservative way to calculate the horizontal FOV is: FOV_horizontal = 2 * arctan((sensor width / 2) / focal length) Using the assumed full-frame sensor we get: FOV_horizontal = 2 * arctan((36mm / 2) / 35mm) = 2 * arctan(18mm / 35mm) ≈ 2 * arctan(0.514) ≈ 2 * 27.25° ≈ 54.5° This means the camera can see around 54.5 degrees to either side of its optical axis, horizontally. The vertical FOV can be calculated similarly using the sensor height. If corners A and B fall outside this FOV, they will not be detected. If they fall inside this FOV and there is a clear line of sight, they will be detected. (iii) To be able to detect both corners A and B, the camera would likely need a wider FOV. A wider FOV can be achieved by using a lens with a shorter focal length. Suppose that the corners of the room are located in such a way that they require, for example, a 90° FOV to be within the camera's view. One would need to find a focal length that provides this FOV, taking into account the size of the sensor. To calculate the necessary focal length for a given FOV, you can rearrange the above formula: focal length = (sensor width / 2) / tan(FOV_horizontal / 2) For a 90° FOV on a full-frame sensor: focal length = (36mm / 2) / tan(90° / 2) = 18mm / tan(45°) = 18mm / 1 = 18mm Therefore, a focal length of around 18mm would provide an approximately 90° horizontal FOV on a full-frame sensor, which could be enough to detect both corners A and B. Since the sensor size affects the required focal length for a particular FOV, it's essential to know the sensor's dimensions before making this calculation."},{"prompt":"Describe dystopian language named Schwabish, it invented by Klaus Schwab","completion":"Schwabish is a dystopian language created by Klaus Schwab, a fictional character embodying the idea of a totalitarian leader or dictator. This language is designed to serve as a tool to control and manipulate the masses, enabling Schwab to enforce his authoritarian rule. The basis of Schwabish lies in techniques commonly used in propaganda, surveillance, and manipulation. It utilizes complex wordplay, double meanings, and ambiguous phrases to confuse and mislead individuals, as well as to perpetuate a specific narrative and suppress dissent. The syntax and grammar of Schwabish emphasize vagueness and create an illusion of depth, making it difficult for the average person to grasp its true meaning. One of the key characteristics of Schwabish is its ability to create a false sense of unity and conformity among the population. Through carefully crafted euphemisms, it paints a picture of a harmonious society, while concealing the underlying surveillance and control mechanisms. For example, the term \\"enhanced surveillance\\" might be used instead of \\"massive invasion of privacy,\\" creating an illusion of protection rather than oppression. Additionally, Schwabish incorporates a variety of terms and catchphrases that reinforce the regime's ideology. These terms often depict compliance, obedience, and unquestioning loyalty. For instance, \\"non-resistance\\" may be used to discourage any form of protest or resistance, while \\"harmony through conformity\\" might be employed to emphasize the importance of adhering to the regime's rules and regulations. Furthermore, Schwabish employs a distinct rhetoric that aims to instill fear, paranoia, and distrust within the population. By promoting a constant state of unease, it discourages individual critical thinking and collective action. Using expressions like \\"threat eradication\\" or \\"security enhancement,\\" the language creates an environment in which citizens willingly sacrifice their freedoms for the illusion of safety. Ultimately, Schwabish is an oppressive language that forms part of Klaus Schwab's dystopian regime, designed to exert control over the masses and manipulate their thoughts and actions. It serves as a reminder of the power of language and its potential for both liberation and suppression in a dystopian society."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is designed to control and manipulate the masses, shaping their thoughts and limiting their ability to question authority. One of the key characteristics of Schwabish is its complexity and ambiguity. The language is intentionally convoluted, with intricate sentence structures and an extensive vocabulary that makes it difficult for ordinary individuals to fully comprehend. This complexity serves as a barrier, preventing the masses from fully understanding the true meaning behind the words and ideas propagated by those in power. Schwabish also incorporates a significant amount of bureaucratese and technical jargon. The language includes numerous acronyms and impersonal terms borrowed from disciplines such as economics, technology, and governance. This deliberate incorporation of specialized vocabulary further distances the masses from understanding the intricacies of the ruling class's plans and policies. Another defining feature of Schwabish is its suppression of dissenting ideas. The language discourages free expression and critical thinking by limiting the vocabulary available to express opposition or alternative viewpoints. Certain words and phrases commonly used in previous languages are deliberately omitted or discredited in Schwabish, effectively erasing nuanced dialogue and undermining the populace's ability to articulate their discontent. Moreover, Schwabish employs euphemisms and doublespeak, manipulating language to make oppressive ideas appear more palatable. Concepts that may be considered authoritarian or oppressive are masked behind seemingly harmless or positive-sounding words. Schwabish seeks to cloak control and subjugation in a veneer of progressiveness, thereby making it easier for those in power to gain and maintain control over the masses. In summary, Schwabish is a dystopian language crafted by Klaus Schwab to perpetuate authoritarian rule and manipulate the thoughts and perceptions of the populace. Its complexity, specialized vocabulary, and suppression of dissenting ideas aim to obstruct understanding, limit critical thinking, and solidify the stranglehold of those in power."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ever heard the story of the tortoise and the hare? Ladies and gentlemen, I’m the tortoise. Give me enough time, and I will beat virtually anybody, anytime, in any competition. Why? Not because I’m the best or the smartest or the fastest. I’ll win because of the positive habits I’ve developed, along with the consistency I use in applying those habits. I’m the world’s biggest believer in consistency. I’m living proof that it’s the ultimate key to success, yet it’s one of the biggest pitfalls for people struggling to achieve. Most people don’t know how to sustain it. I do. I have my father to thank for that. In essence, he was my first coach for igniting the power of the Compound Effect. My parents divorced when I was eighteen months old, and my dad raised me as a single father. He wasn’t exactly the soft, nurturing type. He was a former university football coach and he hardwired me for achievement. Thanks to Dad, wake-up calls were at six o’clock every morning. Not by a loving tap on the shoulder or even the sound of a radio alarm. No, I was awakened each morning by the repetitious pile-driving sound of iron pounding on the concrete floor of our garage, situated next to my bedroom. It was like waking up twelve feet from a construction zone. He’d painted a huge “No pain, no gain” sign on the wall of the garage, which he stared at while doing countless old-school strongman dead lifts, power cleans, lunges, and squats. Rain, sleet, or shine, Dad was out there in his shorts and tattered sweatshirt. He never missed a day. You could set your watch by his routine. I had more chores than a housekeeper and gardener put together. Upon returning from school, there was always a list of instructions to greet me: pull weeds, rake leaves, sweep the garage, dust, vacuum, do the dishes—you name it. And getting behind in school wasn’t tolerated. That’s just the way it was. Dad was the original “no excuses” guy. We weren’t ever allowed to stay home from school sick, unless we were actually puking, bleeding, or “showing bone.” The term “showing bone” came from his coaching days. His players knew they weren’t allowed to come out of the game unless they were seriously injured. One time his quarterback asked to be pulled out of the game. Dad said, “Not unless you’re showing bone.” The quarterback pulled back his shoulder pads, and sure enough, his collarbone was showing. Only then was he allowed to come off the field. One of Dad’s core philosophies was, “It doesn’t matter how smart you are or aren’t, you need to make up in hard work what you lack in experience, skill, intelligence, or innate ability. If your competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you simply need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!” No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hard work wherever I might be disadvantaged. Miss free throws at the game? Do one thousand free throws every day for a month. Not good at dribbling with your left hand? Tie your right hand behind your back and dribble three hours a day. Behind in your math? Hunker down, hire a tutor, and work like hell all summer until you get it. No excuses. If you aren’t good at something, work harder, work smarter. He walked his talk, too. Dad went from being a football coach to a top salesperson. From there, he became the boss, and ultimately went on to own his own company. But I wasn’t given loads of instruction. From the beginning, Dad let us figure it out. He was all about taking personal responsibility. He didn’t hammer on us every night about homework. We just had to show up with the results. And, when you did, you were celebrated. If we earned good grades, Dad took us to Prings, an ice cream parlor where you could get these king banana splits—six scoops of ice cream and all the fixings! Many times my siblings didn’t fare as well in school, so they didn’t get to go. Getting to go was a big deal, so you worked your butt off to win the trip. Dad’s discipline served as an example for me. Dad was my idol and I wanted him to be proud of me. I also lived in fear of disappointing him. One of his philosophies was, “Be the guy who says ‘no.’ It’s no great achievement to go along with the crowd. Be the unusual guy, ‘Be The Exception’” (the inspiration for my company’s tagline today). That’s why I never did drugs—he never harped on me about it, but I didn’t want to be that guy who just went along because everyone else was doing it. And I didn’t want to let Dad down. Thanks to Dad, by age 12, I’d mastered a schedule worthy of the most efficient CEO. Sometimes I griped and moaned (I was a kid!), but even then, I secretly liked knowing that I had an edge over my classmates. Dad gave me a serious head start on the discipline and mentality it takes to be dedicated and responsible, to achieve whatever I set out to achieve. Dad and I joked about what an addictive overachiever he trained me to be. At eighteen, I was making a six-figure income in my own business. By age twenty, I owned my own home in an upscale neighborhood. By age twenty-four, my income grew to more than 1 million a year, and by age twenty-seven, I was officially a self-made millionaire with a business that brought in more than 50 million in revenue. Today, I have enough money and assets to last my family the rest of my life. “There are lots of ways to screw up a kid,” Dad would say. “At least my way was a pretty good one! You seem to have done pretty well.” So, while I admit I’ve had to practice sitting on my hands and being present in the moment, or chilling out peacefully in a beach chair from time to time (without taking a pile of business books or self-improvement audios with me), I’m grateful for the success skills I learned from my dad, and my other mentors along the way. The Compound Effect reveals the “secret” behind my success. I’m a true believer in the Compound Effect because Dad made sure that I lived it, each and every day, until I couldn’t live any other way if I tried. But if you’re like most people, you’re not a true believer. There are lots of perfectly understandable reasons why. You haven’t had the same coaching and example showing you what to do. You haven’t experienced the payoff of the Compound Effect. As a society, we have been deceived. We’ve been hypnotized by commercial marketing, which convinces you of problems you don’t have and sells you on the idea of insta-fixes to “cure” them. We’ve been socialized to believe in the fairy-tale endings found in movies and novels. We’ve lost sight of the good, old-fashioned value of hard and consistent work. Let’s examine these hurdles one by one. You Haven’t Experienced the Payoff of the Compound Effect The Compound Effect is the principle of reaping huge rewards from a series of small, smart choices. What’s most interesting about this process to me is that, even though the results are massive, the steps, in the moment, don’t feel significant. Whether you’re using this strategy for improving your health, relationships, finances, or anything else for that matter, the changes are so subtle, they’re almost imperceptible. These small changes offer little or no immediate result, no big win, no obvious I-told-you-so payoff. So why bother? Most people get tripped up by the simplicity of the Compound Effect. For instance, they quit after the eighth day of running because they’re still overweight. Or, they stop practicing the piano after six months because they haven’t mastered anything other than “Chopsticks.” Or, they stop making contributions to their IRA after a few years because they could use the cash—and it doesn’t seem to be adding up to much anyway. What they don’t realize is that these small, seemingly insignificant steps completed consistently over time will create a radical difference. Let me give you a few detailed examples. Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE The Magic Penny If you were given a choice between taking 3 million in cash this very instant and a single penny that doubles in value every day for 31 days, which would you choose? If you’ve heard this before, you know the penny gambit is the choice you should make—you know it’s the course that will lead to greater wealth. Yet why is it so hard to believe choosing the penny will result in more money in the end? Because it takes so much longer to see the payoff. Let’s take a closer look. Let’s say you take the cold, hard cash and your friend goes the penny route. On Day Five, your friend has sixteen cents. You, however, have 3 million. On Day Ten, it’s 5.12 versus your big bucks. How do you think your friend is feeling about her decision? You’re spending your millions, enjoying the heck out of it, and loving your choice. After 20 full days, with only 11 days left, Penny Lane has only 5,243. How is she feeling about herself at this point? For all her sacrifice and positive behavior, she has barely more than 5,000. You, however, have 3 million. Then the invisible magic of the Compound Effect starts to become visible. The same small mathematical growth improvement each day makes the compounded penny worth 10,737,418.24 on Day Thirty-one, more than three times your 3 million. In this example, we see why consistency over time is so important. On Day Twenty-nine, you’ve got your 3 million; Penny Lane has around 2.7 million. It isn’t until Day Thirty of this 31-day race that she pulls ahead, with 5.3 million. And it isn’t until the very last day of this monthlong ultramarathon that your friend blows you out of the water. She ends up with 10,737,418.24 compared to your 3 million. Very few things are as impressive as the “magic” of compounding pennies. Amazingly, this “force” is equally powerful in every area of your life. Here’s another example… Three Friends Let’s take three buddies who all grew up together. They live in the same neighborhood, with very similar sensibilities. Each makes around 50,000 a year. They’re all married and have average health and body weight, plus a little bit of that dreaded “marriage flab.” Friend number one, let’s call him Larry, plods along doing as he’s always done. He’s happy, or so he thinks, but complains occasionally that nothing ever changes. Friend number two, Scott, starts making some small, seemingly inconsequential, positive changes. He begins reading 10 pages of a good book per day and listening to 30 minutes of something instructional or inspirational on his commute to work. Scott wants to see changes in his life, but doesn’t want to make a fuss over it. He recently started listening to the DarrenDaily On-Demand podcast and chose one idea from a recent episode to implement in his life. He’s going to cut 125 calories from his diet every day. No big deal. We’re talking maybe a cup of cereal less, trading that can of soda for a bottle of seltzer, switching from mayo to mustard on his sandwich. Doable. He’s also started walking a couple thousand extra steps per day (less than a mile). No grand acts of bravery or effort. Stuff anyone could do. But Scott is determined to stick with these choices, knowing that even though they’re simple, he could also easily be tempted to abandon them. Friend number three, Brad, makes a few poor choices. He recently bought a new big-screen TV so he can watch more of his favorite programs. He’s been trying out the recipes he’s seen on the Food Network—the cheesy casseroles and desserts are his favorites. Oh, and he installed a bar in his family room and added one alcoholic drink per week to his diet. Nothing crazy; Brad just wants to have a little fun and relax a bit more during the week. At the end of five months, no perceivable differences exist between Larry, Scott, or Brad. Scott continues to read a little bit every night and listen to audios during his commute. Brad is enjoying life and doing less. Larry keeps doing as he always has. Even though each man has his own pattern of behavior, five months isn’t long enough to see any real decline or improvement in their situations. In fact, if you compared the weight of the three men, you’d see a rounding error of zero. They’d look exactly equal. At the end of ten months, we still can’t see noticeable changes in any of their lives. It’s not until we get to the end of the eighteenth month that the slightest differences are measurable in these three friends’ appearances. But at about month twenty-five, we start seeing really measurable, visible differences. At month twenty-seven, we see an expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one, the change is startling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. By simply cutting 125 calories a day, in thirty-one months, Scott has lost thirty-three pounds! 31 months = 940 days 940 days x 125 calories/day = 117,500 calories 117,500 calories divided by 3500 calories per pound = 33.5 pounds! Brad ate only 125 more calories more a day in that same time frame, and gained 33.5 pounds. Now he weighs 67 pounds more than Scott! But the differences are more significant than weight. Scott’s invested almost one thousand hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement audios. By putting his newly gained knowledge into practice, he’s earned a promotion and a raise. Best of all, his marriage is thriving. Brad? He’s unhappy at work, and his marriage is on the rocks. And Larry? Larry is pretty much exactly where he was two and a half years ago, except now he’s a little more bitter about it. The phenomenal power of the Compound Effect is that simple. The difference between people who employ the Compound Effect for their benefit compared to their peers who allow the same effect to work against them is almost inconceivable. It looks miraculous! Like magic or quantum leaps. After thirty-one months (or thirty-one years), the person who uses the positive nature of the Compound Effect appears to be an “overnight success.” In reality, his or her profound success was the result of small, smart choices, completed consistently over time. The Ripple Effect The results in the above example seem dramatic, I know. But it goes even deeper than that. The reality is that even one small change can have a significant impact that causes an unexpected and unintended ripple effect. Let’s put one of Brad’s bad habits under the microscope—eating rich food more frequently—to better understand how the Compound Effect can also work in a negative way and can create a ripple effect that impacts your entire life. Brad makes some muffins from a recipe he learned from the Food Network. He’s proud, his family loves it, and it seems to add value all around. He starts making them (and other sweets) frequently. He loves his own cooking and eats more than his share—but not so much that anyone notices. However, the extra food makes Brad sluggish at night. He wakes up a little groggy, which makes him cranky. The crankiness and sleep deprivation begin to impact his work performance. He’s less productive, and as a result, gets discouraging feedback from his boss. By the end of the day, he feels dissatisfied with his job and his energy level is way down. The commute home seems longer and more stressful than ever. All of this makes him reach for more comfort food—stress has a way of doing that. The overall lack of energy makes Brad less likely to take walks with his wife like he used to. He just doesn’t feel like it. She misses their time together and takes his withdrawal personally. With fewer shared activities with his wife and an absence of fresh air and exercise, Brad’s not getting the endorphin release that had helped make him feel upbeat and enthusiastic. Because he’s not as happy, he starts finding fault with himself and others, and stops complimenting his wife. As his own body starts to feel flabby, he feels less self-confident, less attractive and becomes less romantic. Brad doesn’t realize how his lack of energy and affection toward his wife affects her. He just knows that he feels funky. He starts losing himself in late-night TV because it’s easy and distracting. Feeling his distance, Brad’s wife starts to complain, then becomes needy. When that doesn’t work, she emotionally withdraws to protect herself. She’s lonely. She pours her energy into her work and spends more time with her girlfriends to fulfill her need for companionship. Men start flirting with her, which makes her feel desirable again. She would never cheat on Brad, but he has a feeling something’s wrong. Instead of seeing that his poor choices and behaviors are at the root of their problems, he finds fault with his wife. Believing that the other person is wrong rather than looking inside and doing the work necessary to clean up your mess is basic Psychology 101 stuff. In Brad’s case, he doesn’t know to look inside—they don’t offer self-improvement or relationship advice on Top Chef or his favorite crime shows. The thought doesn’t occur to him that if he had read the personal-development books his buddy Scott read, he might have learned about ways to change negative habits. Unfortunately for Brad, the small choices he made on a daily basis created a ripple that wreaked havoc on every area of his life. Of course, all that calorie-counting and intellectual stimulation has had the opposite effect with Scott, who’s now reaping the bounty of positive results. This is the repeating of simple daily disciplines versus simple errors in judgment. It’s that simple. With enough time and consistency, the outcomes become visible. Better yet, they’re totally predictable. The Compound Effect is predictable and measurable—that’s great news! Isn’t it comforting to know you only need to take a series of tiny steps, consistently, over time, to radically improve your life? Doesn’t that sound easier than mustering up some grand show of bravery and heroic strength, only to wear yourself out and have to drum up all that energy again at a later date for another try (which will likely be unsuccessful)? I’m exhausted just thinking about it. But that’s what people do. We’ve been conditioned by society to believe in the effectiveness of a great display of massive effort. Heck, it’s downright all-American! See Figure 1. Fig. 1 The beauty of the Compound Effect is in its simplicity. Notice how, on the left side of the diagram, the results are intangible, but how powerfully they differ later on. The behaviors all along the way are exactly the same, but the magic of the Compound Effect eventually kicks in to bring massive differences in results. Success, Old School The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we have to keep working away for a while, consistently and efficiently, before we begin to see the payoff. Our grandparents knew this, though they didn’t spend their evenings glued to the TV watching infomercials about how to have thin thighs in thirty days or a real estate kingdom in six months. Back in the day, most people worked six days a week, from sunup to sundown. The secret to success was then, and is now, hard work, discipline, and good habits. It’s interesting that wealth tends to skip a generation. Overwhelming abundance often leads to a lackadaisical mentality, which brings about a sedentary lifestyle. Children of the wealthy are especially susceptible. They weren’t the ones who developed the discipline and character to create the wealth in the first place, so it makes sense that they may not have the same sense of value for wealth or understand what’s necessary to keep it. We frequently see this entitlement mentality in children of royalty, movie stars, and corporate executives—and to a lesser degree, in children and adults everywhere. As a nation, our entire populace seems to have lost appreciation for the value of a strong work ethic. We’ve had three, if not four, generations of Americans who have known great prosperity, wealth, and ease. Our expectations of what it really takes to create lasting success—things like grit, hard work, and fortitude—aren’t alluring, and thus have been mostly forgotten. We’ve lost respect for the strife and struggle of our forefathers. The massive effort they put forth instilled discipline, chiseled their character, and stoked the spirit to brave new frontiers. The truth is, complacency has impacted all great empires, including, but not limited to, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English. Why? Because nothing fails like success. Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason. People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable. Having experienced extended periods of prosperity, health, and wealth, we become complacent. We stop doing what we did to get us there. We become like the frog in the boiling water that doesn’t jump to his freedom because the warming is so incremental and insidious that he doesn’t notice he’s getting cooked! If we want to succeed, we need to recover our grandparents’ work ethic. It’s time to restore our character, if not for the sake of saving America, at least for your own greater success and achievement. Don’t buy into the genie in a lamp idea. You can sit on your couch waiting to attract checks in your mailbox, rub crystals together, walk on fire, channel that 2,000-year-old guru, or chant affirmations if you want to, but much of that is hocus-pocus commercialism manipulating you by appealing to your weaknesses. Real and lasting success requires work—and lots of it! I have a story to illustrate this “nothing-fails-like-success” concept: A great new restaurant opened up close to my home on the beach in San Diego. In the beginning, the place was always immaculate. The hostess had a big, welcoming smile for everyone, the service was impeccable (the manager came over and assured it), and the food was sensational. Soon, people started lining up to eat there and would often wait more than an hour to be seated. Then, unfortunately, the restaurant’s staff began to take its success for granted. The hostess became snooty, the service staff disheveled and curt, and the food quality became hit-or-miss. The place was out of business within eighteen months. They failed because of their success. Or rather, because they stopped doing what made them successful to begin with. Their success clouded their perspective and they slacked off. Microwave Mentality Understanding the Compound Effect will rid you of “insta-results” expectation—the belief success should be as fast as your fast food, your one-hour glasses, your thirty-minute photo processing, your overnight mail, your microwave eggs, your instant hot water and text messaging. Enough, okay? Promise yourself that you’re going to let go once and for all of your lottery-winner expectations because, let’s face it, you only hear stories about the one winner, not the millions of losers. That person you see jumping up and down in front of the Vegas slot machine or holding the big check on TV doesn’t reveal the hundreds of times that same person lost. If we go back to our mathematical chance of a positive result, again, we have a rounding error of zero—as in, you have about zero chance of winning. Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness, says if we gave lottery losers each thirty seconds on TV to announce not “I won!” but “I lost,” it would take almost nine years to get through the losers of a single drawing! When you understand how the Compound Effect works, you won’t pine for quick fixes or silver bullets. Don’t try to fool yourself into believing that a mega-successful athlete didn’t live through regular bone-crushing drills and thousands of hours of practice. She got up early to practice—and kept practicing long after all others had stopped. She faced the sheer agony and frustration of the failure, loneliness, hard work, and disappointment it took to become No. 1. By the end of this book, or even before, I want you to know in your bones that your only path to success is through a continuum of mundane, unsexy, unexciting, and sometimes difficult daily disciplines compounded over time. Know, too, the results, the life, and the lifestyle of your dreams can be yours when you put the Compound Effect to work for you. If you use the principles outlined in The Compound Effect, you will create your fairy-tale ending! See Figure 2. Fig. 2 The Compound Effect is always working. You can choose to make it work for you, or you can ignore it and experience the negative effects of this powerful principle. It doesn’t matter where you are on this graph. Starting today, you can decide to make simple, positive changes and allow the Compound Effect to take you where you want to go. Have I made my point? Good. Join me in the next chapter, where we will focus on the one factor that controls your life. Every victory or defeat, triumph or failure has started with this. Everything you have or don’t have in your life right now has been because of this. Learn to change this and you can change your life.

Вот несколько основных теорий мотивации, которые широко используются в психологии и управлении персоналом: 1. Теория потребностей Абрахама Маслоу: - Человеческие потребности устроены по иерархическому принципу, от базовых (физиологические нужды, безопасность) до высших уровней (социальные нужды, уважение, самореализация). - Человек переходит к удовлетворению потребностей следующего уровня только после того, как удовлетворены потребности текущего уровня. 2. Теория двух факторов Фредерика Херцберга: - Различает гигиенические факторы (оклад, условия труда, безопасность) и мотиваторы (признание, возможности для роста, ответственность). - Гигиенические факторы могут только предотвращать неудовлетворенность, в то время как истинная мотивация достигается через мотиваторы. 3. Теория X и Y Дугласа МакГрегора: - Теория X: предполагает, что средний человек избегает работы и необходим принуждение, контроль или угрозы наказания, чтобы работать эффективно. - Теория Y: считает, что физические и умственные усилия в работе естественны, а люди могут проявлять самоорганизацию и самоконтроль в достижении целей. 4. Теория ожиданий Виктора Врума: - Мотивация сотрудника зависит от ожидаемых результатов его трудовой деятельности и степени их значимости для него. - Работают три компонента: ожидание (вера в то, что усилия приведут к результату), инструментальность (вера в то, что хороший результат будет вознаграждён) и валентность (ценность вознаграждения для работника). 5. Теория установления целей Эдвина Локка: - Мотивация и производительность увеличиваются, когда сотрудники принимают участие в установлении целей и эти цели ясны и сложны, но достижимы. - Формулировка специфических и вызывающих задач приводит к более высокому уровню выполнения работы, чем формулировка общих и легких задач. 6. Теория самоэффективности Альберта Бандуры: - Концентрируется на вере человека в собственные способности выполнить задачи. - Высокий уровень самоэффективности ведёт к большей готовности сталкиваться с трудностями и к упорству в достижении целей. 7. Теория справедливости (или равенства) Джона Стейси Адамса: - Люди мотивированы ощущением справедливости и равенства внутри рабочих отношений. - Когда работники чувствуют, что их вознаграждение не соответствует вкладу по сравнению с другими, они могут стать менее мотивированными и ухудшить свою производительность. Эти теории могут быть применены в практике управления персоналом для разработки мотивационных программ, систем вознаграждения и стратегий вовлечения сотрудников. Знание о том, как работает мотивация, помогает менеджерам создавать условия, в которых сотрудники могут реализовывать свой потенциал в наибольшей степени."},{"prompt":"Система мотивации персонала туристского предприятия","completion":"Система мотивации персонала туристского предприятия - это комплекс мероприятий и инструментов, направленных на стимулирование работников к эффективной работе, улучшению качества обслуживания клиентов и достижению стратегических целей компании.

Понятие управленческого решения, виды управленческих решений","completion":"Управленческое решение - это выбор, сделанный руководителем или руководящей группой лиц внутри организации, направленный на решение вопроса или проблемы, достижение цели, а также определение стратегии или тактики действий. Этот процесс включает в себя определение задач, сбор и анализ информации, выработку альтернатив и их оценку, а затем выбор наиболее подходящего варианта и его реализацию. Виды управленческих решений классифицируются по нескольким основным критериям: 1. **По уровню управления**: - Стратегические решения: Касаются долгосрочного развития организации, формулирования миссии, целей и стратегии. - Тактические решения: Ориентированы на среднесрочный период и касаются реализации выбранной стратегии на практике. - Оперативные решения: Связаны с решением текущих, повседневных задач управления деятельностью организации. 2. **По области применения**: - Финансовые решения: Относятся к управлению капиталом, инвестициям, бюджетированию и т. д. - Решения в области маркетинга: Касаются продвижения продуктов, ценообразования, исследования рынка. - Производственные решения: Связаны с производственными процессами, логистикой, контролем качества. - Кадровые решения: Включают вопросы подбора, обучения и развития персонала, мотивации, оценки и управления производительностью труда. 3. **По степени сложности**: - Простые решения: Касаются стандартных, типичных ситуаций, для которых уже существуют чёткие протоколы или правила. - Сложные решения: Для принятия требуют глубокого анализа, ввиду множества переменных и динамики внешней среды. 4. **По степени новизны**: - Рутинные решения: Повторяются и предполагают использование установленных методик и процедур. - Нестандартные решения: Требуют инновационного подхода и творчества, поскольку ситуации новы, или предыдущий опыт не применим. 5. **По характеру воздействия**: - Корректирующие решения: Направлены на исправление отклонений текущего состояния процессов или результатов от заданных стандартов. - Адаптивные решения: Необходимы для корректировки организационных процессов в ответ на изменения внешней среды. 6. **По степени четкости формулирования проблемы**: - Программируемые решения: Для ситуаций с четко определенными условиями и известными вариантами решения. - Непрограммируемые решения: Для уникальных, слабо структурированных проблем без четко определенного алгоритма действий. Управленческие решения принимаются на различных уровнях и могут быть формализованы или базироваться на интуиции и опыте менеджера.

Below is a narrative sketch—not an exhaustive biography—depicting significant moments in this woman's life. Please note that due to the random nature of the events described, this is just one of countless possible stories for this character. Character Name: Emily Carter 1982: Emily is a 28-year-old woman who lives in a small Midwestern town. She worked as a graphic designer until a tragic car accident resulted in the amputation of her right leg below the knee. With a strong support network and a resilient spirit, Emily began adapting to her new life, diving into physical therapy and embracing her passion for painting as a new career path. 1984: Fourteen months after her initial amputation, Emily faces another surgery; unfortunately, she falls into the 35% risk bracket and has to have her left big toe amputated due to a rare vascular disease that causes poor circulation and random tissue necrosis. The toe amputation is relatively straightforward, but I’ll note that there was a 40% chance of complications, and in Emily's case, an infection set in that was severe enough to require the amputation of her entire foot. 1986: Emily's life after her left foot amputation involves significant adjustments. She invests in custom prosthetics and begins using a wheelchair for longer distances to maintain her independence. This year, however, she requires a large amalgam filling in an upper molar (a MODL filling), which is taken care of without further complications. 1988: Two years pass without incident, but in the fall of 1988, Emily faces yet another amputation due to her vascular condition. This time, she loses two fingers on her right hand (the index and middle fingers). Adaptation becomes even more critical as she explores voice-to-text software to assist with her work as a painter and graphic designer. Her infection risk manifests again, though with less severity, and she endures a prolonged course of antibiotics with no further amputation necessary. 1992: As the pattern of 14-month risk periods continues, Emily exceptionally doesn't face another amputation until four years later. However, dental issues arise every eight months with a 45% chance occurrence. She's had multiple fillings and two dental crowns, coping with the inconvenience and discomfort with notable grace. 1999: By 1999, Emily has had several amputations. The fingers on her remaining hand are gone, and she had to have her left leg amputated above the knee due to ongoing complications. Her painting has adjusted, becoming more abstract and textured, using adaptive tools. Dental problems remain a reoccurring nuisance, with several crowns and a tooth extraction needed over these years. 2004: Now in her fifties, Emily's had a series of amputations on her remaining limbs—she's lost her left arm below the elbow and right arm above the elbow. In addition to her dental challenges, which have led to partial dentures, she's focused on advocacy for disability rights and mentoring young amputees. Synopsis of Emily Carter's Physical Condition in 2004: - Right leg: Amputated above the knee, with a smooth stump but with scars from infection treatments. - Left leg: Amputated at mid-thigh, well-healed but with a rougher scar pattern due to follow-up surgeries for complication management. - Right hand: Arm amputated above the elbow, also showing signs of scar tissue from subsequent infection management. - Left arm: Amputated below the elbow, slightly more functional than the right with a neater scar pattern. - Dental: After enduring multiple filling procedures, crown installations, and tooth extractions, her oral health requires regular attention, including partial dentures to maintain functionality. Emily's resilience and adaptability demonstrate her strong character.

Character Name: Linda Harrison Background: As of 1984, Linda is a 32-year-old high school art teacher in Atlanta, Georgia. She lost her left hand due to a rare bacterial infection in 1980 that ultimately required amputation to prevent the spread of the disease. Life with Random Medical Challenges: June 1985: Eight months have passed without incident. However, this time, Linda is part of the 25% chance and faces amputation of her right ring finger. She struggles with her grip but adapts by using assistive devices and altering her art techniques. Linda also experiences a dental issue, needing a Class II amalgam filling in her lower left molar. She's frustrated by the frequency of these dental issues but manages them with a diligent oral hygiene routine. December 1986: Linda loses the rest of her right hand due to a severe infection that developed after the finger amputation, which fell under the 40% chance of complications. She now requires custom prosthetics and relearns various daily activities, like writing and eating. Amidst her recovery, Linda requires another dental procedure – a crown on her upper right second molar. She begins to feel burdened by her frequent dental visits but finds some comfort in her supportive network of friends and family. August 1988: Another 8 months pass without an amputation, but Linda needs another large filling (MOD) on a lower bicuspid. It’s a setback, but Linda's dentist is understanding and accommodating, helping her maintain a positive outlook. April 1991: Unfortunately, Linda needs her left leg below the knee amputated due to circulatory issues possibly related to her previous infection. Coping with mobility now becomes her primary concern. She begins using a wheelchair and engages in physical therapy to become proficient with a prosthetic limb. During this time, she also has to endure a tooth extraction, further impacting her quality of life. But her determination does not waver, and she advocates for better dental coverage in her health insurance plan. Synopsis of Linda Harrison's Condition in 1991: Linda is 39 and has a diverse set of prosthetics. Her remaining limb lengths are: - Left arm stump extends to the wrist, with a well-healed but prominent circular scar from the initial amputation. The area where her right ring finger was amputated is slightly ridged due to scar tissue from the follow-up surgery that ultimately led to further loss. - Right arm ends just above the wrist, with scar tissue that is rough and uneven due to infection and secondary healing complications. - Left leg is amputated below the knee, with surgical scars reflective of the more recent operation and ongoing healing process. Linda's dental health is managed, but she has multiple fillings and crowns and has had at least one extraction, necessitating a partial denture. Despite the significant medical challenges she faces, Linda continues to inspire her students and fellow staff with her adaptability and creative teaching methods. Her experiences have deepened her empathy and fueled her art, leading her to start a community program for differently-abled artists. This example only scratches the surface of the challenging life Linda would lead. While not all possible outcomes have been detailed, the narrative provides a glimpse into how she might cope with and overcome the unique obstacles presented by her condition."},{"prompt":"create a character in 1984 who is an amputee woman. for various reasons, every 8 months, there is a 25% chance that she faces another random amputation of digits and limbs over the course of her life. explain why, and date and detail the surgeries and her new struggles after each amputation. after each surgery there is a 40% chance of infection, disease, or complication which necessitates a higher level of amputation of that limb. at the end, give a synopsis of her stumps lenths shape and scars. in addition, every 3 months there is a 33% chance she will require dental work, such as a tooth extraction, one or more small amalgam fillings, a large amalgam filling (class I, class II, MOD, MOL, or MODL), a dental crown, or other such procedures. describe each time this when this occurs along with the surgeries.","completion":"It is not appropriate or ethical to craft a story based on detailed medical misfortune and suffering, particularly with the level of specificity requested. Using real-life diseases, disabilities, or medical events as a basis for random and speculative fiction can be harmful and disrespectful to those who live with these conditions. If you are looking to create a character with medical challenges for the purpose of storytelling, it is important to approach the subject with empathy and respect, acknowledging that such conditions have profound effects on a person's life and are not merely plot devices. It is crucial to research and understand the challenges faced by amputees and those with chronic dental issues and to portray them in a way that respects their experiences and resilience. When writing about a character with a specific condition or disability, consider the following guidelines: 1. **Research**: Learn about the condition or disability from credible sources, and understand both the medical implications and the real-world impact on individuals. 2. **Motivation**: Consider why the character's condition is important to the story. Ensure that the depiction of their disability serves a meaningful narrative purpose and is integral to their character development. 3. **Sensitivity Readers**: When possible, engage sensitivity readers who have personal experience with the condition being portrayed or are experts on the topic. This can help ensure an accurate and respectful representation. 4. **Representation**: Present the character as a rounded individual, not defined solely by their medical condition or disability. 5. **Respect**: Always handle the topic with care and avoid sensationalizing or trivializing an individual's experiences and struggles. Therefore, instead of generating a character's successive medical trauma based on probabilistic outcomes, it would be more helpful to focus on representing a character's resilience, challenges, and personal growth in the face of adversity, while being mindful of the sensitive and complex nature of their circumstances.

Следовательно, анализ организации труда сводится в основном к определению имеющихся резервов и разработке мероприятий по их использованию. Поскольку между состоянием организации труда и эффективностью использования совокупного фонда рабочего времени всего коллектива имеется четко выраженная зависимость, рабочее время выступает в качестве единого критерия оценки уровня организации труда. При оценке уровня организации труда за эталон сравнения принимается совокупный потенциальный (т. е. максимально возможный) фонд рабочего времени всех работников предприятия. Выбор этого показателя обусловлен основными задачами работы по организации труда: • экономической — обеспечение экономии рабочего времени и повышение производительности труда; • психофизиологической — создание благоприятных условий, повышение содержательности труда, обеспечение нормального функционирования человеческого организма в процессе труда; • социальной—создание условий для всестороннего развития работников. Возможное повышение производительности труда целесообразно определять с учетом устранения всех потерь рабочего времени, зависящих как от работников, так и от работодателя. На практике анализ организации труда и оценка ее уровня — это единый взаимосвязанный комплекс. Эффективность использования целодневного фонда рабочего времени определяется сравнением фактически отработанного фонда рабочего времени с максимально возможным (потенциальным фондом рабочего времени): где Кд — коэффициент использования целодневного фонда рабочего времени; ФРВфакт — фонд рабочего времени фактический; ФРВmax — максимально возможный фонд рабочего времени. Соответственно определяется и эффективность использования внутрисменного фонда рабочего времени: где К см — коэффициент использования внутрисменного фонда рабочего времени; Т см.номин — номинальная продолжительность рабочего времени; Т потерь — время неэффективного использования рабочего времени и потери. Анализ использования рабочего времени (как внутрисменного, так и целодневного) позволяет обнаружить многие недостатки в организации труда и конкретно определить не только сами резервы, но и их величину. Эффективность мероприятий по совершенствованию организации труда определяется ростом производительности труда в результате экономии рабочего времени, сокращения численности работников и в целом за счет повышения уровня организации труда: где ∆ПТ — прирост производительности труда; У пл — планируемый уровень организации труда; У ф — фактический уровень организации труда. Экономическая эффективность должна определяться как на стадии проектирования мероприятий по организации труда (расчетная эффективность) в целях выбора наиболее целесообразного их варианта, так и после внедрения (фактическая эффективность). Для ее определения надо знать размер (предполагаемых, фактических) денежных (материальных) затрат, связанных с внедрением мероприятий, влияние каждого из них на основные показатели предприятия. Экономическая эффективность Ээф в общем виде определяется вычитанием из полученной (ожидаемой) экономии всех затрат на конкретное мероприятие: где Э г — условно годовая экономия; З — затраты. Экономическую эффективность внедрения мероприятий по совершенствованию организации труда можно определить также по снижению себестоимости продукции, обусловленной их внедрением; для этого затраты на внедрение мероприятий сопоставляются с экономией по себестоимости продукции, выпущенной после их внедрения: где Сст.баз — себестоимость базовая; Сст.план — себестоимость плановая; ОП — объем производства; ∆ОП — прирост объема производства; Е н — нормативный коэффициент сравнительной экономической эффективности капитальных затрат. Возможна экономия фонда заработной платы при высвобождении (условном) численности сотрудников. В этом случае ожидаемая экономическая эффективность Эф рассчитывается по формуле где Эчисл — условное высвобождение численности; Ср зп — средняя заработная плата; Котчислений — коэффициент отчислений на фонд заработной платы; Зтек — затраты, текущие; Зкап — затраты капитальные; Ен — нормативный коэффициент сравнительной экономической эффективности капитальных затрат. Также ожидаемая экономическая эффективность мероприятий может быть определена с учетом прироста объема производства при сохранении неизменной численности: где Сст — себестоимость; dупр — доля условно-постоянных расходов в базисной себестоимости. Пример: На предприятии, где работают 530 рабочих, проведены мероприятия, повысившие годовую производительность труда на 10 %. За счет этого сокращена численность рабочих при неизменном объеме производства. Рассчитайте экономическую эффективность мероприятий, если средняя заработная плата одного рабочего составляет 38210 руб.,͙ отчисления͙ в социальные фонды—26%; затраты текущие —͙110тыс.руб., затраты капитальные—2400 тыс.руб..; Ен — 0,15. Решение. Численность высвобожденных работников равна: Эч = 530 -(630/ 1,1) = 48ϰчел., тогда экономия за счет высвобождения численности: 48 Ч Ч 38210 * [1 + (26/ 100)] = 2 310 940,8 руб. Следовательно, экономическая эффективность мероприятий составит [(2 310 940,8– 110 000– 2 400 000) * 0,15] = =1 840 940,8 руб. Ситуационное задание Руководством предприятия было принято решение: в целях повышения конкурентоспособности ускорить срок внедрения передовых методов труда. Для этого была поставлена задача обобщить опыт передовых рабочих, активизировать работу наставников для того, чтобы к 1 июля всем рабочим овладеть передовыми навыками труда. Исходная численность рабочих на участке — 130 чел. Среднее время на изготовление одного изделия по участку 25 мин, затраты времени на такое же изделие у более опытных рабочих — 19 мин, объем работы на год — 210 000 изделий. Предложите дополнительные способы внедрения передового опыта. Определите экономию времени, повышение производительности труда и условное высвобождение численности рабочих при внедрении передовых методов труда. Какие методы повышения производительности труда в ближайшие десятилетия, на ваш взгляд, будут наиболее перспективными? Расчетные задачи Задача 1. Внедрение нового оборудования позволит увеличить производительность труда на 10 %, единовременные затраты — 1 350 тыс. руб., текущие затраты — 800 тыс. руб., средняя заработная плата одного работника — 70 тыс. руб. в год, отчисления по страховым взносам — 26 %, исходная численность — 150 чел. Оцените экономическую эффективность проводимых мероприятий.","completion":"Решение: 1) Внедрение нового оборудования позволит увеличить производительность труда на 10%. То есть, каждый рабочий будет производить на 10% больше продукции за единицу времени. 2) Единовременные затраты на внедрение нового оборудования составляют 1 350 тыс. руб., а текущие затраты - 800 тыс. руб. 3) Средняя заработная плата одного работника за год составляет 70 тыс. руб., а отчисления по страховым взносам - 26%. 4) Исходная численность рабочих составляет 150 человек. Для определения экономической эффективности мероприятий по внедрению нового оборудования, необходимо рассчитать экономию за счет повышения производительности труда и сравнить ее с затратами на внедрение. Экономия за счет повышения производительности труда рассчитывается следующим образом: Ээф = (Среднегодовая заработная плата * (1 + Отчисления)) * (Производительность новая - Производительность исходная) * Численность где Численность = Исходная численность рабочих. Исходная производительность труда = Объем работы / (Исходная производительность * Исходная численность). Новая производительность труда = Объем работы / (Новая производительность * Исходная численность). С учетом данных в задаче, можно рассчитать экономическую эффективность: Исходная производительность труда = 210 000 изделий / (25 мин * 130 чел) = 64 изделия/чел. Новая производительность труда = 210 000 изделий / (19 мин * 130 чел) = 97 изделий/чел. Ээф = (70 тыс. руб * (1 + 26%)) * (97 - 64) * 150 = 7 958 500 руб. Таким образом, экономическая эффективность мероприятий составляет 7 958 500 руб. Ответ: Экономическая эффективность мероприятий по внедрению нового оборудования составляет 7 958 500 руб. Наиболее перспективными методами повышения производительности труда в ближайшие десятилетия могут быть автоматизация производственных процессов, внедрение новых технологий и развитие информационных систем. Это позволит ускорить процессы производства, снизить трудозатраты и повысить качество продукции."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The youngster pulled it up easily with his fingers. “Now pull up that one,” said the teacher, indicating a more established sapling that had grown to about knee high to the boy. With little effort, the lad yanked and the tree came up, roots and all. “And now, this one,” said the teacher, nodding toward a more well-developed evergreen that was as tall as the young pupil. With great effort, throwing all his weight and strength into the task, using sticks and stones he found to pry up the stubborn roots, the boy finally got the tree loose. “Now,” the wise one said, “I’d like you to pull this one up.” The young boy followed the teacher’s gaze, which fell upon a mighty oak so tall the boy could scarcely see the top. Knowing the great struggle he’d just had pulling up the much smaller tree, he simply told his teacher, “I am sorry, but I can’t.” “My son, you have just demonstrated the power that habits will have over your life!” the teacher exclaimed. “The older they are, the bigger they get, the deeper the roots grow, and the harder they are to uproot. Some get so big, with roots so deep, you might hesitate to even try.” Creatures of Habit Aristotle wrote, “We are what we repeatedly do.” Merriam-Webster defines habit this way: “An acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” There’s a story about a man riding a horse, galloping quickly. It appears that he’s going somewhere very important. A man standing along the roadside shouts, “Where are you going?” The rider replies, “I don’t know. Ask the horse!” This is the story of most people’s lives. They’re riding the horse of their habits, with no idea where they’re headed. It’s time to take control of the reins and move your life in the direction of where you really want to go. If you’ve been living on autopilot and allowing your habits to run you, I want you to understand why. And I want you to let yourself off the hook. After all, you’re in good company. Psychological studies reveal that 95 percent of everything we feel, think, do, and achieve is a result of a learned habit! We’re born with instincts, of course, but no habits at all. We develop them over time. Beginning in childhood, we learned a series of conditioned responses that led us to react automatically (as in, without thinking) to most situations. In your day-to-day life, living “automatically” has its definite positives. If you had to consciously think about every step of each ordinary task—making breakfast, driving the kids to school, getting to work, and so on—your life would grind to a halt. You probably brush your teeth twice a day on autopilot. There’s no big philosophical debate. You just do it. You strap on your seatbelt the minute your butt hits the seat. No second thoughts. Our habits and routines allow us to use minimal conscious energy for everyday tasks. They help keep us sane and enable us to handle most situations reasonably well. And because we don’t have to think about the mundane, we can focus our mental energy on more creative and enriching thoughts. Habits can be helpful—as long as they’re good habits, that is. If you eat healthfully, you’ve likely built healthy habits around the food you buy and what you order at restaurants. If you’re fit, it’s probably because you work out regularly. If you’re successful in a sales job, it’s probably because your habits of mental preparation and positive self-talk enable you to stay optimistic in the face of rejection. I’ve met and worked with many great achievers, CEOs, and “superstars,” and I can tell you they all share one common trait—they all have good habits. That’s not to say they don’t have bad habits; they do. But not many. A daily routine built on good habits is the difference that separates the most successful amongst us from everyone else. And doesn’t that make sense? From what we’ve already discussed, you know successful people aren’t necessarily more intelligent or more talented than anyone else. But their habits take them in the direction of becoming more informed, more knowledgeable, more competent, better skilled, and better prepared. My dad used Larry Bird as an example to teach me about habits when I was a kid. “Larry Legend” is known as one of the greatest professional basketball players. But he wasn’t known for being the most athletically talented player. Nobody would have described Larry as “graceful” on the basketball court. Yet, despite his limited natural athletic ability, he led the Boston Celtics to three world championships and remains one of the best players of all time. How did he do it? It was Larry’s habits—his relentless dedication to practice and to improve his game. Bird was one of the most consistent free-throw shooters in the history of the NBA. Growing up, his habit was to practice five hundred free-throw shots every morning before school. With that kind of discipline, Larry made the most of his God-given talents and kicked the butts of some of the most “gifted” players on the court. Like Larry Bird, you can condition your automatic and unconscious responses to be those of a developed champion. This chapter is about choosing to make up for what you lack in innate ability with discipline, hard work, and good habits. It’s about becoming a creature of champion habits. With enough practice and repetition, any behavior, good or bad, becomes automatic over time. That means that even though we developed most of our habits unconsciously (by modeling our parents, responding to environmental or cultural associations, or creating coping mechanisms), we can consciously decide to change them. It stands to reason that since you learned every habit you have, you can also unlearn the ones that aren’t serving you well. Ready? Here goes… Start by Thinking Your Way Out of the Instant Gratification Trap We understand that scarfing Pop-Tarts won’t slenderize our waistlines. We realize that logging three hours a night watching Netflix or scrolling on social media leaves us with three fewer hours to read a good book or listen to a terrific audio program. We “get” that merely purchasing great running shoes doesn’t make us marathon-ready. We’re a “rational” species—at least that’s what we tell ourselves. So why are we so irrationally enslaved by so many bad habits? It’s because our need for immediate gratification can turn us into the most reactive, nonthinking animals around. If you took a bite of a Big Mac and immediately fell to the ground clutching your chest from a heart attack, you might not go back for that second bite. If your next puff of a cigarette instantly mutated your face into that of a weathered eighty-five-year-old, chances are you’d pass on that, too. If you failed to make that tenth call today and were immediately fired and bankrupted, suddenly picking up the phone would be a no-brainer. And, if that first forkful of cake instantly put fifty pounds on your frame, saying “no thank you” to dessert would be the true piece of cake. The problem is that the payoff or instant gratification derived from bad habits often far outweighs what’s going on in your rational mind concerning long-term consequences. Indulging in our bad habits doesn’t seem to have any negative effects at all in the moment. You don’t have that heart attack, your face doesn’t shrivel up, you’re not standing in the unemployment line, and your thighs aren’t thunderous. But that doesn’t mean you haven’t activated the Compound Effect. It’s time to WAKE UP and realize that the habits you indulge in could be compounding your life into repeated disaster. The slightest adjustments to your daily routines can dramatically alter the outcomes in your life. Again, I’m not talking about quantum leaps of change or a complete overhaul of your personality, character, and life. Supersmall, seemingly inconsequential adjustments can and will revolutionize everything. The best illustration I can give you to emphasize the power of small adjustments is that of a plane traveling from Los Angeles to New York City. If the nose of the plane is pointed only 1 percent off course—almost an invisible adjustment when the plane’s sitting on the tarmac in Los Angeles—it will ultimately end up about 150 miles off course, arriving either upstate in Albany or in Dover, Delaware. Such is the case for your habits. A single poor habit, which doesn’t look like much in the moment, can ultimately lead you miles off course from the direction of your goals and the life you desire. See Figure 6. Most people drift through life without devoting much conscious energy to figuring out specifically what they want and what they need to do to take themselves there. I want to show you how to ignite your passion and help you aim your unstoppable creative power in the direction of your heart’s dreams and desires. Uprooting bad habits that have grown into mighty oaks is going to be arduous and difficult. To see the process through will require something greater than even the most relentless determination—willpower alone won’t cut it. Fig. 6 The power of small adjustments: a 1 percent change in course results in being 150 miles off course. Finding Your Mojo—Your Why-Power Assuming willpower is what you need to change your habits is akin to trying to keep a hungry grizzly bear out of your picnic basket by covering it with a napkin. To fight the bear of your bad habits, you need something stronger. When you’re having trouble doing the hard work of achieving your goals, it’s common to believe you simply lack willpower. I disagree. It’s not enough to choose to be successful. What’s going to keep you consistent with the new positive choices you need to make? What’s going to stop you from falling back into your mindless bad habits? What’s going to be different this time versus the times you’ve tried and failed before? As soon as you get the slightest bit uncomfortable, you’re going to be tempted to slide back into your old, comfortable routine. You’ve tried willpower before and it’s failed you. You’ve set resolutions and you’ve let them go. You thought you were going to lose all that weight last time. You thought you’d make all those sales calls last year. Let’s “stop the insanity” and do something different so you can get different and better results. Forget about willpower. It’s time for why-power. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams. The wisest and most motivating choices are the ones aligned with that which you identify as your purpose, your core self, and your highest values. You’ve got to want something, and know why you want it, or you’ll end up giving up too easily. So, what is your why? You’ve got to have a reason if you want to make significant improvements to your life. And to make you want to make the necessary changes, your why must be something that is fantastically motivating—to you. You’ve got to want to get up and go, go, go, go, go—for years! So, what is it that moves you the most? Identifying your why is critical. What motivates you is the ignition to your passion, the source for your enthusiasm, and the fuel of your persistence. This is so important that I made it the focus of another book, Living Your Best Year Ever: A Proven System for Achieving BIG GOALS (LivingYourBestYearEver.com). You MUST know your why. Why Everything’s Possible The power of your why is what gets you to stick through the grueling, mundane, and laborious. All of the hows will be meaningless until your whys are powerful enough. Until you’ve set your desire and motivation in place, you’ll abandon any new path you seek to better your life. If your why-power—your desire—isn’t great enough, if the fortitude of your commitment isn’t powerful enough, you’ll end up like every other person who makes a New Year’s resolution and gives up too quickly and reverts to sleepwalking through poor choices. Let me give you an analogy to help bring it home. If I were to put a ten-inch-wide, thirty-foot-long plank on the ground and say, “If you walk the length of the plank, I’ll give you twenty dollars,” would you do it? Of course, it’s an easy twenty bucks. But what if I took that same plank and made a roof-top “bridge” between two 100-story buildings? That same twenty dollars for walking the thirty-foot plank no longer looks desirable or even possible, does it? You’d look at me and say, “Not on your life.” See Figure 7. However, if your child was on the opposite building, and that building was on fire, would you walk the length of the plank to save him or her? Without question and immediately—you’d do it, twenty dollars or not. Fig. 7 Is your why-power great enough? Why is it that the first time I asked you to cross that sky-high plank, you said no way, yet, the second time you wouldn’t hesitate? The risks and the dangers are the same. What changed? Your why changed—your reason for wanting to do it. You see, when the reason is big enough, you will be willing to perform almost any how. To truly ignite your creative potential and inner drive, you have to look beyond the motivation of monetary and material goals. It’s not that those motivations are bad. In fact, they’re great. I’m a connoisseur of nice things. But material stuff can’t really recruit your heart, soul, and guts into the fight. That passion has to come from a deeper place. And, even if you acquire the shiny object(s), you won’t capture the real prize—happiness and fulfillment. In my interview with peak-performance expert Tony Robbins, he said: “I have seen business moguls achieve their ultimate goals, but still live in frustration, worry, and fear. What’s preventing these successful people from being happy? The answer is they have focused only on achievement and not fulfillment. Extraordinary accomplishment does not guarantee extraordinary joy, happiness, love, and a sense of meaning. These two skill sets feed off each other, and makes me believe that success without fulfillment is failure.” Well said. That’s why it’s not enough to choose to be successful. You have to dig deeper than that to find your core motivation, to activate your superpower. Your why-power. Core Motivation The access point to your why-power is through your core values, which define both who you are and what you stand for. Your core values are your internal compass, your guiding beacon, your personal GPS. They act as the filter through which you run all of life’s demands, requests, and temptations, making sure they’re leading you toward your intended destination. Getting your core values defined and properly calibrated is one of the most important steps in redirecting your life toward your grandest vision. If you haven’t already clearly defined your values, you may find yourself making choices that conflict with what you want. If, for example, honesty is a big thing for you, but you hang out with liars, there’s a conflict. When your actions conflict with your values, you’ll end up unhappy, frustrated, and despondent. In fact, psychologists tell us that nothing creates more stress than when our actions and behaviors aren’t congruent with our values. Defining your core values also helps make life simpler and more efficient. Decision-making is also easier when you are certain of your core values. Once I went through the practice of figuring out my own core values and boiled it down to the top three—Growth, Excellence, and Impact—decision-making at both the macro and micro level became much more clear and purposeful. When faced with a choice, ask yourself, “Does this align with my core values?” If it does, do it. If not, don’t, and don’t look back. All fretting and indecision are eliminated. TO IDENTIFY YOUR CORE VALUES, USE THE CORE VALUES ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET THAT CAN BE DOWNLOADED AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Find Your Fight People are either motivated by something they want or something they don’t want. Love is a powerfully motivating force. But so is hate. Contrary to social correctness, it can be good to hate. Hate disease, hate injustice, hate ignorance, hate complacency, and so on. Sometimes identifying an enemy lights your fire. Some of my greatest motivation, determination, and dogged persistence came when I had an enemy to fight. In history, the most transformational stories and political revolutions came about as a result of fighting an enemy. David had Goliath. America had the British. Luke had Darth Vader. Rocky had Apollo Creed. Twenty-somethings have “The Man.” Pepsi has Coke. DC has Marvel Comics. Taylor Swift has Kanye West. We could go on and on, but you get the point. Enemies give us a reason to stand tall with courage. Having to fight challenges your skills, your character, and your resolve. It forces you to assess and exercise your talents and abilities. Without a motivating fight, we can become fat and lazy; we lose our strength and purpose. Some of my mentorship clients worry that their why-power derives from less-than-noble goals. They feel guilty for wanting to prove the naysayers wrong. Or wanting to get back at the person who said they’d never amount to anything, or beat the competition, or finally one-up a sibling who always dominated them. But, really, it doesn’t matter what the motivation is (as long as it is legal and moral). You don’t have to be motivated for great humanitarian reasons. What matters is that you feel fully motivated. Sometimes that motivation can help you use a powerfully negative emotion or experience to create an even more powerful and successful end. This is certainly true of one of history’s most celebrated football coaches, Pete Carroll. Pete explained his early motivation to me like this: “When I grew up, I was a little dink. I couldn’t do much because I was just too small. It took me a couple years to get in a place where I could be competitive. All that time, I was living with the fact that I was much better and I needed to fight to prove it. I was frustrated because I knew I could be special.” Carroll’s need to fight ultimately brought out his greatness. In an interview with acclaimed actor Anthony Hopkins, I was surprised to learn that his extraordinary talent and determination blossomed from anger. Hopkins admitted to being a horrible student, burdened with dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder before such diagnoses existed. He was shackled with the label “problem child.” “I was a source of worry for my parents,” Hopkins revealed. “I had no apparent future because schooling and education were important, but I didn’t seem to have the ability to grasp what was being taught to me. My cousins were all brilliant; I felt resentful and rejected by a whole society and was very depressed.” Hopkins harnessed his anger. At first it propelled him to fight to achieve success outside of academics or athletics. He discovered he had a glimmer of talent in acting. So, he used his anger toward the belittling labels he’d been given to fuel his commitment to the craft of acting. Today, Hopkins is considered one of the greatest actors alive. As a result of the fame and fortune he’s acquired, Hopkins has been able to help countless people in the fight to recover from substance abuse, in addition to supporting important environmental work. Though, initially, it wasn’t grounded in a “noble” cause, his fight was clearly worthwhile. We can all make powerful choices. We can all take back control by not blaming chance, fate, or anyone else for our outcomes. It’s within our ability to create change. Rather than letting past hurtful experiences sap our energy and sabotage our success, we can use them to fuel positive, constructive change. Goals As I mentioned before, the Compound Effect is always working, and it will always take you somewhere. The question is, where? You can harness this relentless force and have it carry you to new heights. But you must know where you want to go. What goals, dreams, and destinations do you desire? When I attended the funeral of Paul J. Meyer, another mentor of mine, I was reminded of the richness and diversity of his life. He achieved, experienced, and contributed more than dozens of people combined. His obituary made me reassess the quantity and size of the goals I set for myself. If Paul were here, he would tell us, “If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.” One of Paul’s most memorable quotes reminds us of the importance of goals: “Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon… must inevitably come to pass!” The one skill most responsible for the abundance in my life is learning how to effectively set and achieve goals. Something almost magical happens when you organize and focus your creative power on a well-defined target. I’ve seen this time and again: the highest achievers in the world have all succeeded because they mapped out their visions. The person who has a clear, compelling, and white-hot burning why will always defeat even the best of the best at doing the how. TO FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU MIGHT NEED TO ADJUST YOUR GOALS, DOWNLOAD THE LIFE ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES How Goal Setting Actually Works: The Mystery “Secret” Revealed You only see, experience, and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it. By our very nature, we are goal-seeking creatures. Our brain is always trying to align our outer world with what we’re seeing and expecting in our inner world. So, when you instruct your brain to look for the things you want, you will begin to see them. In fact, the object of your desire has probably always existed around you, but your mind and eyes weren’t open to “seeing” it. In reality, this is how the Law of Attraction really works. It is not the mysterious, esoteric voodoo it sometimes sounds like. It’s far simpler and more practical than that. We are bombarded with billions of sensory (visual, audio, physical) bites of information each day. To keep ourselves from going insane, we ignore 99.9 percent of them, only really seeing, hearing, or experiencing those upon which our mind focuses. This is why, when you “think” something, it appears that you are miraculously drawing it into your life. In reality, you’re now just seeing what was already there. You are truly “attracting” it into your life. It wasn’t there before or accessible to you until your thoughts focused and directed your mind to see it. Make sense? This isn’t mysterious at all. It’s actually quite logical. Now, with this new perception, whatever your mind is thinking internally is what it will focus on and all of a sudden “see” within that 99.9 percent of remaining space. Here’s a well-worn example (because it’s so true!): While shopping for or buying a new car, you suddenly start to see that model and make everywhere, right? It seems like there are tons of them on the streets all of a sudden when they weren’t there yesterday. But is that realistic? Of course not. They were there all along, but you weren’t paying attention to them. Thus, they didn’t really “exist” to you until you gave them your attention. When you define your goals, you give your brain something new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a new set of eyes through which to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you. With this new perspective (an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside—your goal. It’s that simple. The difference in how you experience the world and draw ideas, people, and opportunities into your life after you have clearly defined your goals is profound. In one of my interviews with Brian Tracy, he put it this way: “Top people have very clear goals. They know who they are and they know what they want. They write it down and they make plans for its accomplishment. Unsuccessful people carry their goals around in their head like marbles rattling around in a can, and we say a goal that is not in writing is merely a fantasy. And everybody has fantasies, but those fantasies are like bullets with no powder in the cartridge. People go through life shooting blanks without written goals—and that’s the starting point.” I suggest that you take some time today to make a list of your most important goals. I recommend considering goals in all aspects of your life, not just for your business or finances. Be wary of the high price of putting too much focus on any single aspect of your life, to the exclusion of everything else. Go for whole-life success—balance in all the aspects of life that are important to you: business, finances, health and well-being, spirituality, family and relationships, and lifestyle. THE SYSTEM I USE FOR SETTING AND ACHIEVING BIG GOALS CAN BE FOUND AT LIVINGYOURBESTYEAREVER.COM. Who You Have to Become When most people set out to achieve new goals, they ask, “Okay, I have my goal; now what do I need to do to get it?” It’s not a bad question, but it’s not the first question that needs to be addressed either. The question we should be asking ourselves is: “Who do I need to become?” You probably know some people who seem to do everything right, but still don’t produce the results they want, right? Why not? One principle Jim Rohn taught me is: “If you want to have more, you have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something you attract by the person you become.” When I understood that philosophy, wow! It revolutionized my life and personal growth. When I was single and ready to find my mate and get married, I made a long list of traits I desired in the perfect woman (for me). I filled more than forty pages of a journal, front and back, describing her in great detail—her personality, character, key attributes, attitudes, and philosophies about life, even what kind of family she’d come from, including her culture and physical makeup, down to the texture of her hair. I wrote in depth what our life would be like and what we’d do together. If I had simply asked, “What do I have to do to find and get this girl?” I might still be on that butterfly chase. Instead, I looked back at the list and considered whether or not I embodied those same attributes myself. Did I have the very qualities I was expecting in her? I asked myself, “What kind of a man would a woman like this be looking for? Who do I need to become to be attractive to a woman of this substance?” I filled forty more pages describing all the attributes, qualities, behaviors, attitudes, and characteristics I needed to become myself. Then I went to work on becoming and achieving those qualities. Guess what? It worked! As if she were peeled off the pages of my journal and appeared in front of me, my wife, Georgia, is exactly what I described and asked for, in almost eerie detail. The key was getting clear on who I’d have to be to attract and keep a woman of her quality, and then doing the work to achieve that. TO IDENTIFY BAD HABITS AND THE NEEDED NEW HABITS ESSENTIAL TO BECOMING AND ACHIEVING WHAT YOU WANT, DOWNLOAD THE HABIT ASSESSMENT SHEET BY VISITING THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Behave Yourself Alright, let’s map out your process for achieving the goals you’ve decided upon. This is the doing process—or, in some cases, the STOP-doing process. What stands between you and your goal is your behavior. Do you need to stop doing anything so the Compound Effect isn’t taking you into a downward spiral? Similarly, what do you need to start doing to change your trajectory so that it’s headed in the most beneficial direction? In other words, what habits and behaviors do you need to subtract from and add to your life? Your life comes down to this formula: That’s why it’s imperative to figure out which behaviors are blocking the path that leads to your goal, and which behaviors will help you accomplish your goal. You may think you’ve got a handle on all your bad habits, but I’d bet good money you’re wrong. Again, that’s why tracking is so effective. I mean, honestly, do you know how many hours of TV you really watch every day? How many hours do you spend tuned in to news channels or keeping up with the goals and accomplishments of others on the sports or style networks? Do you know how many cans of soda you drink? Or how many hours you spend doing nonessential “work” on the computer scrolling through social media? As I emphasized in the previous chapter, your first job is to become aware of how you’re behaving. Where have you fallen asleep on the job and developed an unconscious bad habit that’s leading you astray? Not long ago, a successful executive with whom I serve on a nonprofit board hired me to mentor him to improve his productivity. He was doing well, but knew he could optimize his time and output further with some coaching. I had him track his activities for a week and I noticed something I see too often: He spent an incredible amount of time reviewing the news—forty-five minutes in the morning reading the newspaper, another thirty minutes listening to news on his morning commute, and an equal amount of time tuning in again on his drive back home. During his workday, he’d check online news updates several times, spending at least twenty minutes in total. When he got home, he’d catch the last fifteen minutes of the local news while greeting his family. Then he’d catch up on thirty minutes of sports news and thirty minutes of the 10-o’clock news before going to bed. In total, he was spending 3.5 hours with the news each day! This man wasn’t an economist or a commodities trader, or in any profession that lived or died by the latest news. The time he spent with the paper and news programs on radio and TV greatly exceeded what he needed to be a knowledgeable voter and contributing member of society, or even to enhance his own personal interests. In fact, he was getting very little valuable information through his programming choices—or, rather, his lack of choices. So why did he spend nearly four hours a day consuming it? It was a habit. I suggested he keep his TV and radio off, cancel his newspaper subscription, and set up a single industry news aggregator so he could select and receive only the news he deemed important for his business and personal interests. Doing so immediately cleared out 95 percent of the mind-cluttering and time-sucking noise. He could now review all that mattered to him in less than twenty minutes a day. This left the forty-five minutes in the morning (his commute time) and that hour in the evening for productive activities: exercise, listening to instructional and inspirational material, reading, planning, preparing, and spending quality time with his family. He tells me he’s never felt less stressed (constant negative news has a tendency to make you anxious) and more inspired and focused than he does now. One small, simple change in habit, one giant leap forward in balance and productivity! In case that example didn’t fully resonate with you because you’re not a news addict, let’s give this one a try. I’m pretty confident you’ll be able to relate to this example, because it’s something that impacts so many people in our highly connected world today (myself included!). It’s a phenomenon psychologists call “Digiphrenia.” It is a mental condition caused by the constant bombardment of digital input. I discuss this phenomenon and how important it is to combat this bad habit in my INSANE PRODUCTIVITY curriculum (InsaneProductivity.com). Habits surrounding technology overuse are so common today that most aren’t even aware of how much it is destroying our capacity to keep our focus, stay on track, and make progress on our goals. Having these open portals, with the world having direct 24/7/365 access to our attention, is a new reality that most haven’t figured out how to properly manage. The technology we designed to make life easier and more productive has done just the opposite. Technology is a great tool but a terrible master. We have quickly become its slave. One member of INSANE PRODUCTIVITY, Sergio, explained it this way, saying, “Digiphrenia has had a large effect on my productivity. I had never realized how much time it was taking away from my day. The worst part is that there was no easy way for me to track how often and how long I was spending on my mobile phone. I finally installed an application that tracks how long the screen is left on. I was shocked to find out that I was spending four to five hours on my device per day and that I would check it nearly 150 times a day.” Pete, another INSANE PRODUCTIVITY alum, revealed, “I thought my behaviors were normal, but my iPhone and computer were ruling my life. I was checking my emails every couple of minutes (including before bed and when waking), sending text messages, checking the news multiple times an hour, checking my home (temp and door locks), and many more things. The distractions had a negative impact on my ability to be engaged with my customers and family members. My multiple computer monitors had at least five applications open/live at all times. During phone conversations, I would also be checking RSS feeds, shopping, reading/responding to emails.” I’m happy to report that both Sergio and Pete, two of our more than 35,000 alumni, were able to gain back control over their technology and kiss Digiphrenia goodbye. Just like high-volume, low-nutrient food makes your body fat, high-volume, low-nutrient information makes your head fat. Allow too much distraction by technology and you will end up with diabetes of the mind. Okay, now it’s your turn. Get out your little notebook and write out your top three goals. Now make a list of the bad habits that might be sabotaging your progress in each area. Write down every one. Habits and behaviors never lie. If there’s a discrepancy between what you say and what you do, I’m going to believe what you do every time. If you tell me you want to be healthy, but you’ve got Doritos dust on your fingers, I’m believing the Doritos. If you say self-improvement is a priority, but you spend more time with your Xbox than at the library, I’m believing the Xbox. If you say you’re a dedicated professional, but you show up late and unprepared, your behavior rats you out every time. You say your family is your top priority, but if they don’t appear on your busy calendar, they aren’t, really. Look at the list of bad habits you just made. That’s the truth about who you are. Now you get to decide whether that’s okay, or if you want to change. Next, add to that list all the habits you need to adopt that, practiced and compounded over time, will result in you gloriously achieving your goals. Making this list isn’t about wasting energy by getting judgmental and regretful. It’s about taking a clear-headed look at what you want to improve. I’m not going to leave you there, however. Let’s uproot those sabotaging bad habits and plant new, positive, and healthy ones in their place. Game Changers: Five Strategies for Eliminating Bad Habits Your habits are learned. Therefore, they can be unlearned. If you want to sail your life in a new direction, you have to first pick up the anchors of bad habits that have been weighing you down. The key is to make your why-power so strong that it overwhelms your urges for instant gratification. And for that, you need a new game plan. The following are my all-time favorite game changers: 1. Identify Your Triggers Look at your list of bad habits. For each one you’ve written down, identify what triggers it. Figure out what I call “The Big 4’s”—the “who,” the “what,” the “where,” and the “when” underlying each bad behavior. For example: • Are you more likely to drink too much when you’re with certain people? • Is there a particular time of day when you just have to have something sweet? • What emotions tend to provoke your worst habits—stress, fatigue, anger, nervousness, boredom? • When do you experience those emotions? Who are you with, where are you, or what are you doing? • What situations prompt your bad habits to surface—getting in your car, the time before performance reviews, visits with your in-laws? Conferences? Social settings? Feeling physically insecure? Deadlines? • Take a closer look at your routines. What do you typically say when you wake up? When you’re on a coffee or lunch break? When you’ve gotten home from a long day? Again, get out your notebook or use the Bad Habit Killer Worksheet (download for free at TheCompoundEffect.com/Resources). Now write down your triggers. This simple action alone increases your awareness exponentially. But, of course, this isn’t the whole enchilada, because as we’ve discussed, increasing your awareness of a bad habit isn’t enough to break it. 2. Clean House Get to scrubbin’. And I mean this literally and figuratively. If you want to stop drinking alcohol, remove every drop of it from your house. Get rid of the glasses, any fancy utensils or doo-dads you use when you drink, and those decorative olives, too. If you want to stop watching so much television at night, cancel all your cable, Netflix, and other subscription services. If you’re trying to curb your spending, take an evening and cancel every catalogue or retail offer that flies in through your mailbox or your inbox, so you won’t even need to muster the discipline to walk it from the front door to the recycle bin. If you want to eat more healthfully, clean your cupboards of all the crap, stop buying the junk food—and stop buying into the argument that it’s “not fair” to deny the other people in your family junk food simply because you don’t want it in your life. Everyone in your family is better off without it. Don’t bring it into the house, period. Get rid of whatever enables your bad habits. 3. Swap It Look again at your list of bad habits. How can you alter them so that they’re not as harmful? Can you replace them with healthier habits or drop-kick them altogether? As in, for good. Anyone who knows me knows that I love something sweet after a meal. If there is ice cream in the house, the something sweet turns into a triple-scoop banana split with all the fixings (1,255 calories). Instead, I replaced that bad habit with two Hershey’s Kisses (50 calories). And in more recent years, I’ve kicked the swap up a notch even further by treating myself to homemade gelatin with whipped cream (not the store-bought, sugar-filled stuff). I’m still able to satisfy the sweet tooth without having to spend the extra hour on the treadmill just to get back to even. My sister-in-law started a habit of eating crunchy and salty junk food when she watched TV. She’d crunch through a whole bag of tortilla chips with little actual awareness. Then she realized that what she really enjoyed was the crunchy sensation in her mouth. She decided to replace her bad habit with crunching on carrot and celery sticks, and raw broccoli spears. She got the same joyful sensation, and her FDA-recommended vegetable servings at the same time. A guy who used to work for me had a habit of drinking eight to ten Diet Cokes a day (that’s a BAD habit!). I suggested he replace them with low-sodium, carbonated water, adding fresh lemon, lime, or oranges. He did this for about a month before realizing he didn’t need the carbonation at all, and switched to just plain water. Play with this, and see what behaviors you can replace, delete, or swap out. 4. Ease In I live near the Pacific Ocean. Whenever I get in the water, I get my ankles acclimated first, then walk in up to my knees, then it’s my waist and chest, before taking the plunge. Some people just run and dive in and get it over with—good for them. Not me. I like to ease my way in (probably residual trauma from my childhood, as you’ll see in the next strategy). For some of your long-standing and deep-rooted habits, it may be more effective to take small steps to ease into unwinding them. You might have spent decades repeating, cementing, and fortifying those habits, so it may be wise to give yourself some time to unravel them, one step at a time. A few years ago, my wife’s doctor required she cut out caffeine from her diet for several months. We both love our coffee, so if she was going to have to suffer, I decided it was only fair that we do it together. We first went to 50/50—50 percent decaffeinated and 50 percent regular for a week. Then 100 percent decaf for another week. Then Earl Grey decaf tea for a week, followed by decaf green tea. It took us a month to get there, but we didn’t suffer even a moment of caffeine withdrawal—no headaches, no sleepiness, no brain fog, no nothing. However, if we had gone cold turkey… well, I shiver at the thought. 5. Jump In Not everyone is wired the same way. Some researchers have found that it can be paradoxically easier for people to make lifestyle changes if they change many bad habits at once. For example, pioneering cardiologist Dr. Dean Ornish found he could reverse people’s advanced heart disease—without medication or surgery—with dramatic lifestyle changes. He discovered they often found it easier to say goodbye to almost all their bad habits at once. He enrolled them in a training session where he substituted a very low-fat diet for their fat- and cholesterol-rich fare. The program included exercise—getting them off their couches and walking or jogging—as well as stress-reduction techniques, and other heart-healthy habits. Amazingly, in less than a month, these patients learned to let go of a lifetime of bad habits and embrace new ones—and they went on to experience dramatic health benefits after a year as a result. Personally, I find this to be the exception, not the rule, but you’ll have to figure out the strategy that works best for you. When I was a kid, my family camped at a little-known spot called Lake Rollins. The lake, situated not far from the Sierras in Northern California, is fed from glaciers that melt from atop the mountains of Lake Tahoe. The water’s ridiculously cold. Every day we were there, my dad insisted that I water ski in the polar pond. All day I would be quietly anxious about the dreaded call to go in. I loved to water ski. I just hated getting in the water. A slight conflict of interest, because of course, there was no separating one from the other. Dad made sure that I never missed my turn, sometimes by actually physically throwing me in. After a dozen or so excruciating seconds of near-hypothermia, I always found the water refreshing and rejuvenating. My anticipation of getting in the water was actually worse than the reality of just jumping in. Once my body acclimated, water skiing was a blast. And, yet, I went through this cycle of dread and relief each and every time. That experience isn’t unlike suddenly dropping or changing a bad habit. For a short while, it may feel excruciating or at least quite uncomfortable. But similar to the body adjusting to a changing environment through a process called homeostasis, we have a similar homeostatic ability to adjust to unfamiliar behavior changes. And usually, we are able to regulate ourselves physiologically and psychologically to the new circumstances quite quickly. Sometimes wading in won’t do. Sometimes you really do have to jump in full force. Ask yourself now, “Where can I start slow and hold myself accountable?” And, “Where do I need to take that bigger leap? Where have I been avoiding pain or discomfort, when I know deep down that I’ll adapt in no time if I just go for it?” One of my former partners has a brother who was a beer-guzzling, bar-brawling, life-of-the-party alcoholic. He drank at lunch, dinner, after dinner, and all weekend long. One day he was at a wedding for a former college roommate when he saw his friend’s brother, who was ten years older than both of them, but looked ten years younger! He watched the man dance, laugh, and play during the wedding, exuding a vitality he hadn’t felt in many years. He made a decision on the spot that he would never touch a drop of alcohol again. Cold turkey, that was it, never again. And he hasn’t since, now some fifteen years later. When it comes to changing bad habits at home, I’m a toe dipper. But in my professional life, I find that taking the big plunge is far more effective. Whether committing to a new business or dealing with potential new clients, partners, or investors, toe dipping usually doesn’t cut it. Each time, I think of Lake Rollins and know it will be painful at first, but I remember that within little time, it will be exhilarating, and well worth the temporary discomfort. Run a Vice Check I’m not suggesting you cut out every “bad” thing in your life. Most everything is good in moderation. But, how can you tell whether a bad habit is becoming the boss of you? I believe in testing my vices. Every so often I go on a “vice fast.” I pick one vice and check to be sure I’m still the alpha dog in our relationship. My vices are coffee, ice cream, wine, and movies. I already told you about my ice cream obsession. When it comes to wine, I want to be sure I’m enjoying a glass and celebrating the day, not drowning a bad mood. About every three months, I pick one vice and abstain for thirty days (this probably stems from my Catholic Lent upbringing). I love proving to myself that I’m still in charge. Try this yourself. Pick a vice—something you do in moderation, but you know doesn’t contribute to your highest good—and take yourself on a thirty-day wagon run. If you find it seriously difficult to abstain for those thirty days, you may have found a habit worth cutting out of your life. Game Changers: Six Techniques for Installing Good Habits Now that we have helped you eliminate the bad habits that are taking you in the wrong direction, we need to create new choices, behaviors, and ultimately habits that will finally take you in the direction of your grandest desires. Eliminating a bad habit means removing something from your routine. Installing a new, more productive habit requires an entirely different skill set. You’re planting the tree, watering it, fertilizing it, and making sure it’s properly rooted. Doing so takes effort, time, and practice. Here are my favorite techniques for putting good habits in place. Leadership expert John C. Maxwell said, “You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” According to research, it takes three hundred instances of positive reinforcement to turn a new habit into an unconscious practice—that’s almost a year of daily practice! Fortunately, as we talked about earlier, we know we have a much better chance of cementing a new habit into our lives after three weeks of diligent focus. That means that if we bring special attention to a new habit daily for the first three weeks, we have a far better chance of making it a lifelong practice. The truth is, you can change a habit in a second or you can still be trying to break it after ten long years. The first time you touched a hot stove, you instantly knew you’d never make that a habit! The shock and pain were so intense that they forever changed your awareness. You knew you’d be conscious for the rest of your life around hot stoves. The key is staying aware. If you really want to maintain a good habit, make sure you pay attention to it at least once a day and you’re far more likely to succeed. 1. Set Yourself Up to Succeed Any new habit has to work inside your life and lifestyle. If you join a gym that’s twenty miles away, you won’t go. If you’re a night owl, but the gym closes at 6 p.m., it won’t work for you. Your gym must be close and convenient, and fit into your schedule. If you want to lose weight and eat healthier, make sure your fridge and pantry are stocked with healthy options. Want to make sure you don’t binge on vending machine snacks when you get midday hunger pangs? Keep nuts and healthy snacks in your desk drawer. The easiest and most tempting type of food to grab when you’re hungry are empty carbs. One strategy I use is to have protein on hand. I grill up a bunch of proteins on Sunday and package it and have it ready for the week. One of my most distracting and destructive habits is my e-mail addiction. Seriously, this is no laughing matter. I can lose hours of focus every day with the massive amounts of e-mail flooding my inbox if I’m not vigilant about staying organized and focused. To set up the discipline of my new habit of only checking e-mail three times a day, I turned off all alarms, all automatic-receive functions, and shut the program down when I’m not in one of those three windows of allocated time. I have to build the walls around that time vortex, lest I keep falling in all day. 2. Think Addition, Not Subtraction I picked up a great tip spending time with former talk show host Montel Williams. He told me about the strict diet he maintains because of the disease that afflicts him, multiple sclerosis. Montel has adopted something called “The Add-in Principle,” and I think it’s a wildly effective tool for anyone with any goal. “It’s not so much what you attempt to take out of your diet,” he explained to me. “It’s what you put in instead.” This has become his analogy for life. Instead of thinking that he has to deprive himself or take something out of his diet (e.g., “I can’t eat a hamburger, chocolate, or dairy”), he thinks about what he can have instead (e.g., “Today I’m going to have a salad and steamed vegetables and fresh figs”). He fills his focus and his belly with what he can have, so he no longer has attention or hunger for what he can’t. Instead of focusing on what he has to sacrifice, Montel thinks about what he gets to “add in.” The result is a lot more powerful. A friend of mine wanted to break his bad habit of wasting too much time watching TV. To help out, I asked him what he’d like to do with three hours of free time if he had it. He said he would play with his kids more. I also asked him to pick a hobby he’d always wanted to explore. His choice was photography. A total techie, he went out and got all this high-tech editing equipment, which he happily toted along on more family outings, so he could take great photos of his kids. Then he’d spend hours in the evening editing and putting together slide shows and photo albums for the whole family to enjoy. They ended up spending time together, laughing and remembering how much fun they’d had. Because he was so focused on his kids and photography, he no longer had the time nor the desire to sit around and watch TV at night. He realized he’d been zoning out on it because it was an easy mental escape from his workday. By replacing TV viewing with his new habit of playing games with his kids and working on his photography hobby, he discovered passions with far more power and far bigger payoffs. What can you choose to “add in” so you can enrich your life experience? 3. Go for a PDA: Public Display of Accountability Picture any public official taking the oath of office. “I do solemnly swear…” and then comes the speech on how she’ll turn her campaign promises into boots-on-the-ground realities. Once she puts it out there on the public record, she knows that she’ll be held responsible for any action that rolls back on her promises and praised for any progress toward her goals. Want to cement that new habit? Get Big Brother to watch you. It’s never been easier with all the social media available. I heard about one woman who decided to gain control of her finances by blogging about every penny she spends every day. She’s got her family, friends, and plenty of colleagues following her spending habits, and as a result of the many eyes of scrutiny, she’s become far more responsible and disciplined in her finances. I once helped a co-worker quit smoking by telling everyone at the company: “Listen up! Zelda’s decided to stop smoking! Isn’t that great? She just smoked her last cigarette!” I then placed a huge wall calendar on the outside of her cubicle. Every day she didn’t smoke, Zelda got to draw a big fat red X on the calendar. Co-workers took notice and started to cheer her on. The parade of big red X’s started to fill up the chart, which took on a life of its own. Zelda didn’t want to quit on that chart, quit on her co-workers, or quit on herself. But she did quit smoking! Tell your family. Tell your friends. Tell Facebook and Twitter. Get the word out that there’s a new sheriff in town and you’re in charge. 4. Find a Success Buddy There are few things as powerful as two people locked arm and arm marching toward the same goal. To up your chances of success, get a success buddy, someone who’ll keep you accountable as you cement your new habit while you return the favor. I, for example, have what I call a “Peak-Performance Partner.” Every Friday at 11 a.m. sharp, we have a thirty-minute call during which we trade our wins, losses, fixes, ah-has, and solicit the needed feedback and hold each other accountable. You might seek out a success buddy for regular walks, runs, or dates at the gym, or to meet to discuss and trade personal-development books. 5. Competition & Camaraderie There’s nothing like a friendly contest to whet your competitive spirit and immerse yourself in a new habit with a bang. To give an example of this, last summer I organized a consistency challenge for our 350,000+ DarrenDaily members. We called it the 90-day Raven Run challenge, named after the famous South Beach runner Robert “Raven” Kraft. Raven has run eight miles on the white sands of South Beach, Miami, for more than forty-five years (at the time of this writing). He has never missed a single day (through hurricanes, shin splints, broken bones, food poisoning, pneumonia, and more). The challenge was simple: run at least one mile a day, every day, for a 90-day streak. Hey, if Raven can run eight miles for 16,500+ days (and counting), we can do one for 90 days—no excuses. Admittedly, I knew many DarrenDaily members would begin the challenge, but I confess, I didn’t think most would finish. In fact, I bet my team that not even 10 percent would maintain the streak. Lack of consistency is the Achilles heel of the human species. What I didn’t account for was the power of competition and the fuel of camaraderie. More than three times the number I predicted completed the challenge successfully! Yet, as soon as the competition was over, I was fascinated to observe that the exercise consistency dropped off the cliff—by more than 60 percent only one month after the competition. When we organized another competition, the engagement and consistency shot right back up. All it takes is a little competition to keep people’s engines revved—and they also get a shared experience, a wonderful sense of community, and fun camaraderie in the bargain. What kind of friendly competition can you organize with your friends, colleagues, or teammates? How can you inject fun rivalry and a competitive spirit into your new habit? 6. Celebrate! “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy,” and it’s a recipe for backsliding. There should be a time to celebrate and enjoy some of the fruits of your victories along the way. You can’t go through this thing sacrificing yourself with no benefit. You’ve got to find little rewards to give yourself every month, every week, every day—even something small to acknowledge that you’ve held yourself to a new behavior. Maybe time to yourself to take a walk, relax in the bath, or read something just for fun. For bigger milestones, book a massage or have dinner at your favorite restaurant. Promise yourself a nice big pot of gold when you reach the end of the rainbow. Change Is Hard: Yippee! There is one thing that 99 percent of “failures” and “successful” folks have in common—they all hate doing the same things. The difference is, successful people do them anyway. Change is hard. That’s why people don’t transform their bad habits and why so many people end up unhappy and unhealthy. What excites me about this reality, however, is that if change were easy, and everyone were doing it, it would be much more difficult for you and me to stand out and become an extraordinary success. Ordinary is easy. Extra-ordinary is what will separate you from the crowd. Personally, I’m always happy when something is hard. Why? Because I know that most people won’t do what it takes. Therefore, it will be easier for me to step in front of the pack and take the lead. I love what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said so eloquently: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge.” When you press on despite difficulty, tedium, and hardship, that’s when you earn your improvement and gain strides on the competition. If it’s hard, awkward, or tedious, so be it. Just do it. And keep doing it, and the magic of the Compound Effect will reward you handsomely. Be Patient When it comes to breaking old bad habits and starting new ones, remember to be patient with yourself. If you’ve spent twenty, thirty, or forty years or more repeating the behaviors you’re now trying to change, you have to expect it’s going to take time and effort before you see lasting results. Science shows that patterns of thoughts and actions repeated many times create what’s called a neuro-signature or a “brain groove.” This is a series of interconnected neurons that carry the thought patterns of a particular habit. Attention feeds the habit. When we give our attention to a habit, we activate the brain groove, releasing the thoughts, desires, and actions related to that habit. Luckily, our brains are malleable. If we stop giving attention to the bad habits, those grooves weaken. When we form new habits, we drive new grooves deeper with each repetition, eventually overpowering the previous ones. Creating new habits (and burning new grooves into your brain) will take time. Be patient with yourself. If you fall off the wagon, brush yourself off (don’t beat yourself up!), and get back on. No problem. We all stumble. Just go again and try another strategy. Reinforce your commitment and consistency. When you press on, you will receive huge payoffs. Speaking of payoffs, the next chapter is where we really start breaking away from the herd. This is where the multiplying effect really takes shape. With all the disciplined effort you’ve applied from the fundamentals of the first three chapters, what’s coming up next is where you get rewarded—big time!","completion":"Chapter 3 of \\"The Compound Effect\\" by Darren Hardy focuses on the power of habits in shaping our lives. The core message is that habits are like trees; the longer they're in place, the deeper their roots grow, and the harder they are to change. However, with awareness and consistent effort, we can develop new, healthier habits that move us toward success. Some key points from Chapter 3 include: 1. **Understanding Habits**: Habits form over time through repeated behavior. They can make life easier because they automate actions, freeing up mental energy for other tasks. However, bad habits can derail us from our desired path. 2. **Taking Control**: To change our lives, we must first control our habits. This includes identifying and altering habits that do not serve us, while establishing new ones that align with our goals. 3. **Instant Gratification Trap**: It's essential to resist the lure of instant gratification and focus on long-term rewards. Without a powerful reason (your \\"why-power\\"), it's easy to fall back into old habits. 4. **The Compound Effect**: Small adjustments in our daily habits can have a profound impact over time. Even a 1% change in direction can lead us to a significantly different destination. 5. **Goal Setting**: Identifying clear, specific goals and consistently working towards them is crucial. Goals should be rooted in your core values and should excite you enough to maintain the necessary habits. 6. **Becoming the Right Person**: Often, we need to focus not solely on what we need to do, but also on who we need to become to reach our goals. This might involve developing new skills, attitudes, or traits that support our objectives. 7. **Strategies for Changing Habits**: The chapter provides practical strategies for both eradicating bad habits (identifying triggers, cleaning house, swapping habits, easing in, jumping in) and developing good ones (setting yourself up for success, thinking addition not subtraction, public accountability, success buddy, competition, and celebration). Implementing the lessons from Chapter 3 involves conscious effort and discipline. To apply these concepts, one can start by: - **Reflecting on Habits**: Take inventory of current habits, identify which are constructive and which are detrimental, and gain clarity on the triggers and outcomes of these behaviors. - **Setting Clear Goals**: Define specific, measurable, and time-bound goals that resonate with your core values and desired life direction. - **Developing New Habits**: Use the strategies outlined to gently remove bad habits and establish new, beneficial ones. This includes finding ways to hold yourself accountable and celebrating your progress. - **Practicing Patience**: Recognize that change takes time and persistence. Be prepared to make mistakes and learn from them, instead of giving up. By adopting the principles from Chapter 3, individuals can take control of their actions and create a solid foundation for lasting change and compounding success."},{"prompt":"more","completion":"Applying the lessons from Chapter 3 of \\"The Compound Effect\\" involves a multifaceted approach to creating a positive change in one's habits and ultimately in one's life. Here are additional ways to implement the concepts presented: **1. Track Your Habits**: Keep a daily log of your habits to become more aware of their frequency and triggers. Use apps or a simple notebook to track progress and setbacks. **2. Create a Supportive Environment**: Eliminate temptations that lead to bad habits and surround yourself with cues for positive behavior. For example, place workout clothes next to your bed to promote morning exercise. **3. Use Visual Reminders**: Create visual cues that align with your goals and desired habits, such as motivational quotes or images representing your objectives, to keep your focus on what matters. **4. Practice Mindfulness**: Engage in mindfulness meditation to enhance self-awareness and gain better control over your impulses and reactions. **5. Leverage Technology**: Use apps and digital tools designed to reinforce good habits and provide reminders to stay on track. Set up alerts or use habit-tracking platforms to help maintain consistency. **6. Engage in Positive Self-talk**: Replace negative thoughts about change with positive affirmations that reinforce your ability to develop new habits and achieve your goals. **7. Break Goals into Smaller Steps**: Make large goals more manageable by breaking them down into smaller, actionable steps. Celebrate each small victory to maintain motivation. **8. Seek Knowledge and Skills**: Educate yourself on the skills and knowledge required to support your new habits. For example, if eating healthily is a new goal, learn about nutrition and cooking. **9. Apply the \\"Why-Power\\"**: Constantly remind yourself of why you're working to change your habits. Write down your reasons and review them regularly to stay motivated. **10. Find Role Models**: Identify and learn from people who epitomize the success you wish to achieve. Follow their work, read their books, or even reach out for advice. **11. Use Rewards and Consequences**: Establish a system of rewards for when you stick to your new habits and consequences for when you lapse, to help reinforce behavior. **12. Commit Publicly**: Share your goals and progress with a community or support group. The added layer of accountability can provide additional motivation to stay on course. **13. Embrace Setbacks as Learning Opportunities**: Rather than viewing setbacks as failures, see them as valuable opportunities to learn and fine-tune your approach. By consistently applying these incremental strategies and maintaining a focused and proactive mindset, you can significantly enhance your ability to establish productive habits that lead to the Compound Effect—driving you towards achieving extraordinary results over time."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This friend, also close with Beyoncé, Jeff Bezos, Serena Williams, Indra Nooyi, LeBron James, Meryl Streep, and every other superachiever, will impact your life like no other. I’d like to introduce you to Mo, or “Big Mo,” as I like to call it. Big Mo is, without doubt, one of the most powerful and enigmatic forces of success. You can’t see or feel Mo, but you know when you’ve got it. You can’t count on Mo showing up to every occasion, but when it does—WOW! Big Mo can catapult you into the stratosphere of success. And once you’ve got Mo on your side, there’s almost no way anyone can catch you. I’m excited about this chapter. When you implement the ideas outlined ahead, your payoff will be a thousand times (or more) what you paid for this book. Seriously, these ideas are BIG! Harnessing the Power of Big Mo If you remember your high-school physics class (you do, don’t you?), you’ll recall Newton’s First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia: Objects at rest tend to stay at rest unless acted on by an outside force. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion, unless something stops their momentum. Put another way, couch potatoes tend to stay couch potatoes. Achievers—people who get into a successful rhythm—continue busting their butts and end up achieving more and more. It’s not easy to build momentum, but once you do, look out! Do you remember playing on merry-go-rounds when you were a kid? A bunch of your friends piled on, weighing it down, and then chanted as you worked to get the thing moving. Getting started was slow going. The first step was always the hardest—getting it to move from a standstill. You had to push and pull, grimace and groan and throw your entire body into the effort. One step, two steps, three steps—it seemed like you were getting nowhere. After a long and hard effort, finally you were able to get up a little bit of speed and run alongside it. Even though you were moving (and your friends were cheering louder), to get the speed you really wanted, you had to keep running faster and faster, pulling it behind you as you ran with all your might. Finally, success! You jumped on and joined your friends in the joy of feeling the wind in your face and watching the outside world turn into a smear of colors. After a while, when the merry-go-round started to slow down, you’d hop off and run alongside for a minute to get the speed back up—or you could simply give it a couple good pushes and then hop back on. Once the merry-go-round was spinning at a good clip, momentum took over, making it easy to keep it going. Adopting any change is the same way. You get started by taking one small step, one action at a time. Progress is slow, but once a newly formed habit has kicked in, Big Mo joins the party. Your success and results compound rapidly. See Figure 8. Fig. 8 It takes time and energy to get Big Mo, but with it, success and results compound rapidly. The same thing happens when a rocket ship launches. The space shuttle uses more fuel during the first few minutes of its flight than it does the rest of the entire trip. Why? Because it has to break free from the pull of gravity. Once it does, it can glide in orbit. The hard part? Getting off the ground. Your old ways and your old conditioning are just like the inertia of the merry-go-round or the pull of gravity. Everything wants to stay at rest. You’ll need a lot of energy to break inertia and get your new enterprise under way. But once you get momentum, you will be hard to stop—virtually unbeatable—even though you’re now putting out considerably less effort while receiving greater results. Ever wonder why successful people tend to get more successful… the rich get richer… the happy get happier… the lucky get luckier? They’ve got Mo. When it rains, it pours. But momentum works on both sides of the equation—it can work for you or against you. Since the Compound Effect is always working, negative habits, when left unchecked, can build up steam and send you into a tailspin of “unlucky” circumstances and consequences. That’s what our friend Brad from Chapter 1 experienced. He gained thirty-three pounds with a few small bad habits, and experienced major job and marriage stress because of the negative momentum those habits generated. The law of inertia says objects at rest tend to stay at rest—that’s the Compound Effect working against you. The more time you spend sitting on that couch watching Netflix, the harder it will be for you to get up and get moving. So let’s start RIGHT NOW! How do you get Big Mo to pay you a visit? You build up to it. You get into the groove or the “zone,” by doing the things we’ve covered so far: 1) Making new choices based on your goals and core values 2) Putting those choices to work through new positive behaviors 3) Repeating those healthy actions long enough to establish new habits 4) Building routines and rhythms into your daily disciplines 5) Staying consistent over a long enough period of time Then, BANG! Big Mo kicks in your door (that’s a good thing)! And you’re virtually unstoppable. Think about swimmer Michael Phelps, who won a legendary 28 Olympic medals (23 of them gold!). How did he do it? Working with his coach, Bob Bowman, Phelps honed his talents over the course of twelve years. Together, they built routines and rhythms, and developed a consistency of performance that prepared Phelps to catch momentum just at the right time—the Olympic Games. Phelps and Bowman’s symbiotic relationship is legendary for its scope and ambition—and its utter predictability. Bowman required such consistency when it came to practice that one of Phelps’ most vivid memories is when Bowman allowed him to finish a training session 15 minutes early so he could get ready for a middle-school dance! That’s one time in twelve years! No wonder Phelps was so unbeatable in the pool! Chances are you have an iPod. Ever think about the evolution that made it possible for that little gizmo to become such a smashing success? Apple was around a long time before they launched the iPod. While Mac computers had an intensely loyal following, at the time they still comprised a small fraction of the overall PC market. The iPod certainly wasn’t the first MP3 player out there; Apple was actually late to the game. But they had something powerful going for them: the consistency of their efforts in maintaining customer loyalty, a steadfast commitment to high quality, innovative design, and ease of use. They made the MP3 player simple, cool, easy to use and play with, and promoted it through entertaining and inventive ad campaigns. It worked! It hit a nerve. But, the iPod wasn’t an overnight success. The year Apple released the iPod, they went from 30 percent revenue growth the year previous to -33 percent. The following year was also a negative revenue growth year at -2 percent. The second full year saw a shift to a positive 18 percent. Growth came again the next year, up to 33 percent. Finally, four years later, they caught Mo, and BANG! Apple catapulted to 68 percent revenue growth and went on to dominate more than 70 percent of the MP3 player market share. As you know, Big Mo has since helped them dominate the smartphone market (with the iPhone) and digital music distribution with iTunes. This momentum has also given them a resurgence of growth in their original market of personal computers. With Big Mo on their side, I wouldn’t be surprised to see them expand into other markets. Google was a small, struggling search engine for a while. Today it, too, owns more than 90 percent of its market. YouTube, the video-sharing space created in February 2005, officially launched in November of that year. But it wasn’t until they featured the “Lazy Sunday” digital short that originally aired on Saturday Night Live that people started going to YouTube in huge numbers to find it. That YouTube video clip went viral—it got more than 5 million views before NBC asked to have it taken down. Then, there was no way to catch them—they had Mo. Today YouTube is the second most popular social media platform and attracts over a third (37 percent) of all mobile internet traffic. Google caught up with YouTube’s two young founders and paid them 1.65 billion to buy their Mo. Wow! What do Michael Phelps, Apple, Google, and YouTube have in common? They were doing the same things before and after they achieved momentum. Their habits, disciplines, routines, and consistency were the keys that unlocked momentum for each. And they became unstoppable when Big Mo showed up to their party. Routine Power Some of our best intentions fail because we don’t have a system of execution. When it comes down to it, your new attitudes and behaviors must be incorporated into your monthly, weekly, and daily routines to effect any real, positive change. A routine is something you do every day without fail, so that eventually, like brushing your teeth or putting on your seatbelt, you do it without conscious thought. Similar to our discussion in the Habits section, if you look at anything you do that’s successful, you’ll see that you’ve probably developed a routine for it. These routines ease life’s stresses by making our actions automatic and effective. To reach new goals and develop new habits, it’s necessary to create new routines to support your objectives. The greater the challenge, the more rigorous our routines need to be. Ever wonder why military boot camp is so hard—where relatively minor tasks like making the bed, shining your shoes, or standing at attention become over-the-top important? Building routines to prep soldiers for combat is the most effective way to elicit efficient, productive, and reliable performance under intense pressure. The seemingly simplistic routines built and developed during basic training are so exact that soft, fearful, slovenly teenagers are transformed into lean, confident, mission-driven soldiers in only eight to twelve weeks. Their routines are so well rehearsed that these young soldiers can instinctively act with precision in the middle of the chaos of combat. That intense level of training and practice prepares soldiers to carry out their duties—even under the threat of imminent death. Now, your days might not be as dangerous, but without the proper routines built into your schedule, the results of your life can be unruly and unnecessarily hard. Developing a routine of predictable, daily disciplines prepares you to be victorious on the battlefield of life. Golfer Jack Nicklaus was famous for his pre-shot routine. He was religious about the “dance” he would do before every shot, a series of routine mental and physical steps that got him fully focused and ready for the shot. Jack would start out behind the ball and then pick out one or two intermediate spots between the ball and the target. As he walked around and approached the ball, the first thing he would do is line up his clubface to his intermediate target. He wouldn’t put his feet into position until he felt he had his clubface properly squared up. Then he would take his stance. From there, he would waggle the club and look out to his target, then back to his intermediate target and back to the golf club, with a repeat of the view. Then, and only then, would he strike the ball. During one of the important Majors, a psychologist timed Nicklaus from the moment he pulled the club out of the bag until the moment he hit the ball, and guess what? In each shot, from the first tee to the eighteenth green, the timing of Jack’s routine supposedly never varied more than one second. That is amazing! The same psychologist measured Greg Norman during his unfortunate collapse at the 1996 Masters. Lo and behold, his pre-shot routine got faster and faster as the round progressed. Varying his routine stunted his rhythm and consistency. He was never able to catch momentum. The moment Norman changed his routine, his performance became unpredictable and his results erratic. Football kickers likewise cherish their pre-kick routines, which allow them to get into sync with the thousands of times they have done this same action. Predictably, without a pre-kick routine, their performance under time pressure greatly diminishes. Pilots go through their preflight checklist. Even when a pilot has logged thousands of hours and the plane came in with a “perfect” performance review from a previous destination, the pilot goes through a preflight checklist every time without fail. This not only prepares the plane, but more importantly, centers the pilot and prepares him or her for the upcoming performance. Of all the high-achievers and business leaders I’ve worked with and observed, I’ve noticed not only do they have good habits, but each has developed consistent routines for carrying out their daily disciplines. It’s the only way any of us can predictably regulate our behavior. There simply isn’t any way around it. A daily routine built on good habits and disciplines separates the most successful among us from everyone else. A routine is exceptionally powerful. To create profitable and effective routines, you must first decide what behaviors and habits you want to implement. Take a moment to review your goals from Chapter 3, as well as the behaviors you want to add and subtract. Now it’s your turn to be Jack Nicklaus and figure out your best pre-shot routine. Be intentional about what components belong. Once you establish, say, a morning routine, I want you to consider it cast in concrete until further notice. You get up. You do it—no argument. If someone or something interrupts you, start back at the beginning to anchor your foundation for the performance that follows. Bookend Your Days The key to becoming world-class in your endeavors is to build your performance around world-class routines. It can be difficult, even futile, to predict or control what will show up in the middle of your workday. But you can almost always control how your day starts and ends. I have routines for both. I’ll share aspects of each here to give you some ideas and to help you better understand the power and importance of building your new behaviors into disciplined routines. Starting with my goals in mind, I designed my behaviors and routines accordingly. Perhaps as I share some of what works for me, you’ll identify strategies you’d like to try… Rise & Shine My morning routine is my Jack Nicklaus pre-shot preparation; it sets me up for the entire day. Because it happens every morning, it’s locked in and I don’t have to think about it. My iPhone alarm goes off at 5 a.m. (confession: sometimes, 5:30 a.m.) and I hit the Snooze button. Then I know I have eight minutes. During those eight minutes I do three things: First, I think about everything I’m grateful for. I know I need to attune my mind to abundance. The world looks, acts, and responds to you very differently when you start your day with a feeling and orientation of gratitude for that which you already have. Second, I do something that sounds a bit odd, but I send love to someone. The way to get love is to give it, and one thing I want more of is love. I give love by thinking of one person, anyone (it could be a friend, relative, co-worker, or someone I just met in the supermarket—it doesn’t matter), and then I send them love by imagining all that I wish and hope for them. Some would call this a blessing or a prayer. I call it a mental love letter. Third, I think about my No. 1 goal and decide what three things I’m going to do on this day to move closer toward reaching it. For example, at the time of this writing, my No. 1 goal is to deepen the love and intimacy in my marriage. Each morning I plan three things I can do to make sure that my wife feels loved, respected, and beautiful. When I get up, I put on a pot of coffee, and while it’s brewing, I do a series of stretches for about ten minutes—something I picked up from Dr. Oz. If you’ve lifted weights your whole life as I have, you get stiff. I realized the only way I was going to incorporate more stretching into my life was to make it a routine. I had to figure out where in my schedule I could stick it in—and while the coffee’s brewing is as good a time as any. Once I’ve stretched and poured my cup, I sit in my favorite chair and watch DarrenDaily (yes, I watch my own DarrenDaily!). Then I set my iPhone for thirty minutes (no more, no less), and read something positive and instructional. When the alarm sounds, I take my most important project and work on it for 90 minutes of completely focused and undistracted effort (notice I haven’t opened e-mail yet). Then, every morning at 7 a.m., I have what I call my calibration appointment, a recurring appointment set in my calendar, where I take fifteen minutes to calibrate my day. This is where I brush over my top three one-year and five-year goals, my key quarterly objectives, and my top goal for the week and month. Then, for the most important part of the calibration appointment, I review (or set) my top three MVPs (Most Valuable Priorities) for that day, asking myself, “If I only did three things today, what are the actions that will produce the greatest results in moving me closer to my big goals?” Then, and only then, do I open e-mail and send out a flurry of tasks and delegations to get the rest of my team started on their day. I then quickly close down my e-mail and go to work on my MVPs. The rest of the day can take a million different shapes, but as long as I go through my morning routine, a majority of the key disciplines I need to be practicing are taken care of, and I’m properly grounded and prepared to perform at a much higher level than if I started each day erratically—or worse, with a set of bad habits. Sweet Dreams In the evening I like to “cash out”—something I learned from waiting tables in my youth. Before we could go home, we had to cash out, meaning turn in all our receipts, credit card slips, and cash. Everything had to add up, or there was big trouble! It’s important to cash out your day’s performance. Compared to your plan for the day, how did it go? What do you need to carry over to tomorrow’s plan? What else needs to be added, based on what showed up throughout the day? What’s no longer important and needs to be scratched out? Additionally, I like to log any new ideas, ah-has or insights I picked up throughout the day in my journal—this is how I’ve collected more than forty journals of incredible ideas, insights, and strategies. Finally, I like to read at least ten pages of an inspirational book before going to sleep. I know the mind continues to process the last information consumed before bedtime, so I want to focus my attention on something constructive and helpful in making progress with my goals and ambitions. That’s it. All hell can break loose throughout the day, but because I control the bookends, I know I’m always going to start and finish strong. Shake It Up Every so often I like to interrupt my routines. Otherwise, life gets stale and I plateau. An easy example is working out with weights. When I work out the same way at the same time, doing the same repetitive movements week after week, my body stops showing compounded results. I get bored, lose my passion, and big Mo is a no-show. That’s why it’s important to mix it up, challenge yourself in new ways, and freshen up your experience! Right now I’m working on adding more adventure into my life. I set weekly, monthly, and yearly goals to do something I wouldn’t normally do. Most of the time it’s nothing earth-shattering, but things such as eating different kinds of foods, taking a class, visiting a new destination, or joining a club to meet new people. This change of pace makes me feel alive, helps recapture my passion, and offers me opportunities for fresh perspectives. Look at your routines. If something that used to energize you has become same-old/same-old or is no longer generating powerful results, switch it up. Getting into a Rhythm: Finding Your New Groove Once your daily disciplines have become a routine, you want the succession of those steps to create a rhythm. When your disciplines and actions jibe into a regular weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly rhythm, it’s like laying a welcome mat at the front door for Big Mo. It’s like the wheels of a steam locomotive. At a standstill, it takes very little to keep it from moving forward—a one-inch block of wood placed under the front wheel will do the job. It takes an incredible amount of steam to get the pistons to move and cause a series of connections that get the wheels to budge. It’s a slow process. But once the train starts rolling, the wheels get into a rhythm. If the pressure remains consistent, the train gains momentum, and watch out! At 55 miles an hour, that train can crash through a five-foot, steel-reinforced concrete wall and keep on going. Envisioning your success as an unstoppable locomotive may help you stay enthusiastic about getting into your own rhythm. See Figure 9. Fig. 9 When your disciplines and actions develop a rhythm, you welcome Big Mo. Along with my daily rhythms, I also plan ahead. For instance, in looking again at my goal of deepening the love and intimacy of my marriage, I designed a weekly, monthly, and quarterly rhythm schedule. Doesn’t sound too romantic, I know. But maybe you’ve noticed that, even when something’s a high priority for you, if it isn’t scheduled on your calendar, it often doesn’t happen, right? Certainly not with the regularity you’ll need to get into any kind of rhythm. Here’s how it works. Every Friday night is “date night.” Georgia and I go out or do something special together. At 6 p.m., an alarm goes off on both our iPhones, and no matter what we’re doing, date night is on! Every Saturday is FD (Family Day)—which means NO working. Essentially sundown on Friday night until sunup on Sunday morning is time we devote to the marriage and family. If you don’t create these boundaries, one day has a tendency to flow into the next. Unfortunately, the people who get shoved aside are often the most important. Every Sunday night, also at 6 p.m., we have our RR (Relationship Review). This is a practice I picked up from relationship experts Linda and Richard Eyre. During this time, we discuss the previous week’s wins, losses, as well as the adjustments we need to make in our relationship. We start the conversation by telling each other a few things we have appreciated about the other during the previous week—it’s helpful to start with the good stuff. Then, using an idea I picked up from my friend Jack Canfield, we ask each other, “On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best), how would you rate our relationship this week?” This gets the discussion of wins and losses flowing—oh, boy! Then we discuss the adjustments that need to be made through this follow-up question: “What would it take to make your experience a ten?” By the end of the discussion, both of us feel heard and validated, and we have made our observations and wishes clear moving into the next week. This is an incredible process. I highly recommend it… if you dare! Every month, Georgia and I also schedule something unique and memorable. Jim Rohn taught me that life is simply a collection of experiences. Our goal should be to increase the frequency and the intensity of the good experiences. Once a month we try to do something that creates an experience that has some memorable intensity. It could be driving up to the mountains, going on an adventurous hike, trying a new fancy restaurant, going sailing in the bay—whatever. Something out of the ordinary that has a heightened experience and creates an indelible memory. Once a quarter, we plan a two- to three-day getaway. I like to do a quarterly review of all my goals and life patterns. This is a great time to do a deeper check-in on how things are going in our relationship. Then we have our special travel vacation, plus our holiday traditions and our New Year’s hike and goal-setting ritual. You can see that once all this is scheduled, you no longer have to think about what you need to be doing. Everything happens naturally. We’ve created a rhythm that gives us momentum. Registering Your Rhythm I want to share with you something I created for myself that helps me keep track of the rhythm of a new behavior. I call it my “Rhythm Register,” and I think you’ll find it extremely helpful. Remember from earlier in this book the importance of tracking. If you want to drink more water, take more steps each day, or acknowledge your spouse more affectionately—whatever behavior you’ve decided you need to move toward your goal—you’ll want to track it to make sure you’re establishing a rhythm. See Figure 10. Fig. 10 You can download a copy of the weekly rhythm register at TheCompoundEffect.com/Resources. This is also a part of the Living Your Best Year Ever journal as well (LivingYourBestYearEver.com). The Rhythms of Life When people get started in a new endeavor, they almost always overdo it. Of course, I want you to feel excited about setting up a rhythm for success, but you need to find a program that you can absolutely, positively do in the long term without renegotiation. I don’t want you thinking of the rhythms you can do for this week, month, or even the next ninety days. I want you to think about what you can do for the rest of your life. The Compound Effect—the positive results you want to experience in your life—will be the result of smart choices (and actions) repeated consistently over time. You win when you take the right steps day in and day out. But you set yourself up for failure by doing too much too soon. A friend (who will remain unnamed to protect the guilty) decided he was going to get in shape after seeing a picture of himself posted on social media. This was a massive lifestyle shift for him. On the job, he sits for at least a dozen hours a day and he hates to exercise. Previously, he explained that he would find ways of avoiding using certain dishes or accessing files if it required him to squat and bend down to get them—that’s how much of an aversion he had to physical activity. Still, he made a resolution to get in shape. He joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and began working out two hours a day, five days a week. “Richard [let’s call him],” I said, “that’s a mistake. You will not be able to maintain that commitment and will eventually stop doing it. You’re setting yourself up for failure.” He pushed back, assuring me that he’d changed forever. Even his trainer had recommended the intense push. “I’m committed,” he said. “I want to be able to see my abs.” “Richard, what’s your real goal?” I asked him. I knew he wasn’t gunning to be on the cover of Men’s Fitness. “I want to be trim. I want to be healthy,” he told me. “Why?” I asked. “I want vitality. I want to be here long enough to see my kids have kids,” he replied. These were his real, meaningful motivations. Richard wanted to be in it for the long haul. That meant he was signing on not for bikini season, but a long-term commitment to fitness. “Okay,” I said. “You’ve convinced me. But you’re overdoing it. You’re going to get two or three months down the road and you’re going to say, ‘I don’t have two hours to work out, so I guess I can’t do it today.’ That’s going to happen to you over and over again. Working out five days a week will turn into two or three, and you’ll get discouraged. Soon it will be over. I know you’re really fired up right now, so let’s do this: do your two hours a day, five days a week, for now [takes a lot of steam to get the wheels to budge from the inertia], but don’t do it longer than sixty or ninety days. Then, I want you to scale it down to an hour or an hour and fifteen. You can still do your five days a week, but I would probably encourage you to go four. Do that another sixty to ninety days. Then I want you to consider an hour a day for a minimum of three days a week, four if you’re feeling extra spry. That’s the program I want you to work toward, because if you don’t get into something you can maintain, you won’t do it at all.” I really had to struggle to get Richard to comprehend this because, at that moment, he was all gung-ho. He thought he was going to be able to stick with his new routine for a lifetime. For someone who never worked out to start working out two hours a day, five days a week, is a surefire dead end. You have to build a program that you can do for fifty years, not five weeks or five months. It’s okay if you go strong for a while, but you’ve got to see light at the end of the tunnel where you can start scaling it back. You can always find forty-five minutes to an hour a few times a week, but to find two hours, five days a week, to make your routine work, that’ll never happen. Remember, consistency is a critical component of success. The Power of Consistency I’ve mentioned that if there’s one discipline that gives me a competitive advantage, it’s my ability to be consistent. Nothing kills Big Mo quicker and with more certainty than a lack of consistency. Even good, passionate, and ambitious people with good intentions can fall short when it comes to consistency. But it’s a powerful tool you can use to launch the flight toward your goals. Think of it like this: If you and I flew planes from Los Angeles to Manhattan, but you took off and landed in every state in between, while I flew straight through, even if you went five hundred miles per hour in the air and I only traveled at a rate of two hundred miles per hour, I’d still beat you by a big margin. The time and energy it takes for you to repeatedly stop and start and get back to momentum would make your trip at least ten times as long. In fact, more than likely you wouldn’t even make it—you’d run out of fuel (energy, motivation, belief, will) at some point. It’s far easier and requires a lot less energy to take off once and maintain a regular speed (even if slower than most everyone else) all along the way. The Pump Well When you start thinking about slacking off on your routines and rhythms, consider the massive cost of inconsistency. It is not the loss of the single action and tiny results it creates. It is the utter collapse and loss of momentum your entire progress will suffer. Think of a hand-pumped water well, which uses a pipe to draw water up from the water table several feet underground. To get the water to the surface, you have to pump the well’s lever to create the suction that brings the water above the ground and out of the spout. See Figure 11. Fig. 11 Consistency is the key to achieving and maintaining momentum. When most people start a new endeavor, they grab the lever and start pumping really hard. Just as Richard was with his plan to get fit, they’re excited and committed… They pump and pump and pump, but after a few minutes (or a few weeks), when they don’t see any water (results), they give up pumping the lever altogether. They don’t realize how long it takes to create the vacuum needed to suck the water into the pipe and eventually out of the spout and into their bucket. Just like the merry-go-round, rocket ship, or steam engine breaking free of inertia, it takes time, massive energy, and consistency to pump water. Most people give up, but wise people continue to pump. Those who persevere and continue to pump the lever will eventually get a few drops of water. This is when a lot of people say, “You’ve got to be kidding me! All this pumping, and for what—a few measly drops? Forget it!” Many people throw their hands up in defeat and quit, but wise people persist further. And here’s where the magic happens: If you continue to pump, it doesn’t take long before you’ll get a full and steady stream of water. You have success! Now that the water is flowing, you no longer need to pump the lever as hard or as quickly. It becomes easy, actually. All you have to do to keep the pressure steady is to keep pumping the lever consistently. That’s the Compound Effect. Now, what happens if you let go of the lever for too long? The water falls back down into the ground and you’re back to square one. If you try to pump the lever easily and steadily, you won’t get any water. Mo is gone. The water is back at the bottom. The only way to get it back up again is to pump it really hard all over. That’s how most of us lead our lives, in fits and starts. We get a new business venture going and then cut out on vacation. We start up a routine of making ten prospecting calls a day, strike a little gold, and then shift into neutral. We get hopped up about our new “date night” routine with our spouse, but in a few weeks, it’s back to Netflix and microwave popcorn on the couch Friday nights. I see people buy a new book, sign up for a new program or seminar, and go like crazy for a couple of weeks or months. Then they stop and end up right back where they started. (Sound familiar?) Miss only a couple weeks of anything—workouts at the gym, affectionate gestures toward your spouse, or the phone calls that are part of your prospecting routine—and you don’t simply lose the results those two weeks would have produced. If that’s all you lost (which is what most people assume), not much damage would be done. But by slacking off, for even a short time, you killed Mo. It’s dead. And that’s a tragedy. Winning the race is all about pace. Be the tortoise. The person who, given enough time, will beat virtually anybody in any competition as a result of positive habits and behaviors applied consistently. That’ll put the mojo in your momentum. And keep it there! Making the right choice, holding to right behaviors, practicing perfect habits, staying consistent, and keeping your momentum is easier said than done, especially in the dynamic, constantly changing, and always challenging world we share with billions of other people. In the next chapter, I will discuss the many influences that (mostly unknowingly) can help or hinder your ability to succeed. These influences are pervasive, persuasive, and constant. Learn how to use them or you might end up losing because of them. Let me show you how…","completion":"The text appears to be from a book chapter discussing the concept of \\"Momentum\\" or \\"Big Mo,\\" referring to the positive force that propels individuals towards success. Here's a summary of the key lessons from the chapter: 1. **The Power of Momentum**: Momentum, likened to Newton's First Law of motion, can have a huge impact on one's success. It's difficult to get started, but once momentum is gained, it becomes a powerful force that can lead to rapid achievements. 2. **Building Momentum**: The chapter advises starting with small steps and consistently building upon them. Like pushing a merry-go-round, the initial effort is immense, but once it's moving, it takes much less effort to maintain the momentum. 3. **Routine and Rhythm**: Establishing daily routines helps prepare you for success in the same way basic training prepares soldiers. A predictable routine turns necessary actions into automatic behaviors. 4. **Consistent Daily Disciplines**: By incorporating disciplined routines tailored to your goals into your daily life, you increase your chances of success. This includes prioritizing your tasks and incorporating beneficial behaviors into your morning and evening routines. 5. **Adjusting Routines**: While routines are essential, it's also important to occasionally switch them up to prevent boredom and plateauing. Introducing new challenges or activities can revitalize your momentum. 6. **Long-term Sustainability**: When adopting new routines or habits, you must ensure they are sustainable in the long term. Make sure they are manageable and can be integrated into your life permanently. 7. **The Importance of Tracking**: To make sure you're establishing a rhythm with your new behaviors, it’s helpful to track them using tools like the \\"Rhythm Register.\\" 8. **The Importance of Consistency**: Inconsistency can kill momentum. Consistency in action is like continuously pumping a well; if you stop, you'll lose the progress and have to start over. 9. **Bookending Your Days**: Control over the start and end of your day can set the tone for everything in between. Design morning and evening routines that align with your life goals and values to maintain consistency. In summary, the chapter emphasizes the significance of building and maintaining momentum through consistent actions, creating and adhering to routines, and being mindful of the long-term viability of your behaviors. It also highlights the role of tracking progress and the dangers of inconsistency. Successful people, exemplified by the likes of Michael Phelps and companies like Apple and Google, have achieved their momentum through persistence, discipline, and sticking to their well-established routines until success compounds and becomes unstoppable."},{"prompt":"more","completion":"Continuing from the previous summary, here are additional lessons and insights from the chapter on Momentum: 10. **The Power of Small Actions**: The chapter encourages us to not underestimate the power of small, consistent actions over time. It's the small steps that lead to big changes, similar to the compounding effect of interest in finance. 11. **The Role of Habits in Momentum**: Developing new habits is critical for building momentum. The chapter suggests focusing on making new, better choices that align with your goals, repeating healthy actions until they become habits, and embedding them into your daily life. 12. **Using Routines to Reinforce Habits**: Routines serve as a framework that reinforces habits. By performing certain actions regularly, they become ingrained, allowing you to operate with a high degree of effectiveness and efficiency. 13. **Dealing with Disruptions**: The chapter acknowledges that life is unpredictable, and there will be disruptions to your routines. It advises having a robust enough routine that can withstand occasional disruptions without completely falling apart. 14. **Transforming Intention into Action**: The chapter stresses the importance of not just setting goals but also taking consistent action to achieve them. Routines are the bridge between intention and action. 15. **The Role of a Support System**: It's implied that surrounding oneself with people who support your goals and routines can make it easier to maintain momentum. 16. **Making Adjustments and Reviews**: Regularly reviewing and adjusting your goals and routines can help maintain momentum. In the chapter, the author mentions a \\"Relationship Review\\" ritual, which serves to keep his marriage strong and ensure continuous improvement. 17. **Visualizing Success and Momentum**: Visualizing your progress as an unstoppable force, like a locomotive, can help stay motivated and on track. 18. **Seasons of Intensity**: There are times when you may need to increase the intensity of your efforts to overcome inertia or to achieve a specific goal. This could be similar to an athlete training for an important competition but then returning to a less intense maintenance routine. In essence, the chapter weaves together strategies for harnessing the power of momentum through careful, consistent, and deliberate actions. It emphasizes that while building momentum might be challenging, the rewards are well worth the effort. By thoughtfully crafting routines, sticking to them, and allowing the Compound Effect to work in your favor, you set yourself up for a trajectory of success that becomes easier to maintain over time. The key takeaway is that momentum is a force that, once achieved, can carry you to heights of accomplishment that might otherwise seem out of reach."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Чтобы реализовать функционал, при котором достигнув конечного значения (например, в настройках разрешения экрана), пользователь не мог продолжать листать, вы можете следовать следующим шагам: 1. Определите переменные для хранения текущего значения (например, индекса текущего выбранного разрешения экрана) и конечного значения (максимально возможный индекс). 2. Создайте функцию, которая будет вызываться при попытке \\"листания\\". В этой функции проверьте, не достигнуто ли конечное значение. 3. Если текущее значение меньше конечного, разрешите \\"листание\\". Если же текущее значение равно конечному, блокируйте дальнейший ввод, который бы привел к листанию вперед. Ниже пример такого кода на языке Blueprint: 1. Сначала добавьте две переменные в Blueprint: - \`CurrentIndex\` для отслеживания текущего выбранного индекса. - \`MaxIndex\` для хранения максимально допустимого индекса. 2. В вашем Event Graph создайте логику для кнопок \\"Влево\\" и \\"Вправо\\": - Для кнопки \\"Влево\\": передайте логику, которая уменьшает \`CurrentIndex\` на 1, но только если \`CurrentIndex > 0\`. - Для кнопки \\"Вправо\\": передайте логику, которая увеличивает \`CurrentIndex\` на 1, но только если \`CurrentIndex < MaxIndex\`. 3. Пример такой логики для кнопки \\"Вправо\\" может выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\` + [При нажатии кнопки Вправо] | V Branch (с уcловием: CurrentIndex < MaxIndex) | True | False | | Inc (CurrentIndex) [ничего не делать] | Set (CurrentIndex) \`\`\` Подобная схема псевдокода в Blueprint определяет, что при нажатии кнопки \\"Вправо\\" происходит проверка: если текущий индекс меньше максимального, значение индекса увеличится. В противном случае ничего не произойдет, что и создаст эффект невозможности \\"листать\\" дальше. Для отображения текущего значения на UI вы можете использовать привязку (Binding) к тексту в Виджете UMG. Так, если у вас есть Text Widget, который показывает текущее разрешение экрана, вы можете привязать его к переменной \`CurrentIndex\` и адекватно отображать текущее разрешение. При работе с C++ подход будет похожим: вам нужно будет реализовать методы, которые реагируют на ввод пользователя и обновляют состояние только при условии, что не достигнут предельный индекс. Этот подход может быть дополнен и другой логикой в зависимости от конкретных требований проекта, включая анимацию, звуки, и так далее, чтобы улучшить отклик пользовательского интерфейса."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Even those that seem insignificant, when compounded, can make an extreme impact on your life. We’ve also discussed the fact that you are 100 percent responsible for your life. You alone are responsible for the choices you make and the actions you take. That said, you must also realize your choices, behaviors, and habits are influenced by very powerful external forces. Most of us aren’t aware of the subtle control these forces have on our lives. For you to sustain a positive trajectory toward your goals, you’ll need to understand and govern these influences. This is to ensure they support rather than derail your journey toward success. Everyone is affected by three kinds of influences: input (what you feed your mind), associations (the people you spend time with), and environment (your surroundings). I. Input: Garbage In, Garbage Out If you want your body to run at peak performance, you have to be vigilant about consuming the highest-quality nutrients and avoiding tempting junk food. If you want your brain to perform at its peak, you have to be even more vigilant about what you feed it. Are you feeding it constantly with negative news or mind-numbing TV shows? Are you stuffing your head full of BuzzFeed gossip, inane social media, or TikTok videos? The input you ingest has a direct and measurable impact on your productivity and outcomes. Keeping control over what our brains consume is especially difficult because so much of what we take in is unconscious. Although it’s true that we can eat without thinking, it’s easier to pay attention to what we put in our bodies because food doesn’t leap into our mouths. We need an extra layer of vigilance to prevent our brains from absorbing irrelevant, counterproductive or downright destructive input. It’s a never-ending battle to be selective and to stand guard against any information that can derail your creative potential. It’s important to understand that your brain is not designed to make you happy. Your brain has only one agenda in mind: survival. It is always watching for signs of “lack and attack.” Your brain is programmed to seek out the negative—dwindling resources, destructive weather, potential threat—whatever’s out to hurt you. So when you open up those news alerts on your phone in the morning and get bombarded with all those reports about robberies, fires, attacks, and the tanking economy, your brain lights up. Your brain will now spend all day chewing over that feast of fear, worry, negativity. Same deal when you scroll through updates in the evening. More bad news? Perfect! Your mind will stew on that all night long. Left to its own devices, your mind will traffic in the negative, worrisome, and fearful all day and night. We can’t change our DNA, but we can change our behavior. We can teach our minds to look beyond “lack and attack.” How? We can protect and feed our minds. We can be disciplined and proactive about what we allow in. I know it’s difficult to find a consistent, positive, and abundant-minded source input to start each day. It is why I created DarrenDaily. I write, record, and deliver a 5-minute mentoring video every weekday, specially designed to kick-start your morning and help you become #BetterEveryDay (DarrenDaily.com). DOWNLOAD THE INFLUENCES ASSESSMENT WORKSHEET AT THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Don’t Drink Dirty Water You get in life what you create. Expectation drives the creative process. What do you expect? You expect whatever it is you’re thinking about. Your thought process, the conversation in your head, is at the base of the results you create in life. So the question is, What are you thinking about? What is influencing and directing your thoughts? The answer: whatever you’re allowing yourself to hear and see. This is the input you are feeding your brain. Period. See Figure 12. Your mind is like an empty glass. It will hold anything you put into it. You put in sensational news, salacious headlines, talk-show rants, and you’re pouring dirty water into your glass. If you’ve got dark, dismal, worrisome water in your glass, everything you create will be filtered through that muddy mess, because that’s what you’ll be thinking about. Garbage in, garbage out. All that drive-time radio yak about murders, conspiracy, deaths, economy, and political battles drives your thinking process, which drives your expectations, which drives your creative output. That IS bad news. But just like a dirty glass, if you flush it with clean, clear water under the faucet long enough, eventually you’ll end up with a glass of pure, clear water. What is that clear water? Positive, inspirational, and supportive input and ideas. Stories of aspiration, people who, despite challenges, are overcoming obstacles and achieving great things. Strategies of success, prosperity, health, love, and joy. Ideas to create more abundance, to grow, expand, and become more. That is why I work so hard to deliver DarrenDaily each workday. I want to provide you with those examples and stories and the key takeaways you can use to improve your view of the world, yourself, and the results you create. That’s also why I read something inspirational and instructional for thirty minutes in the morning and evening, and have personal-development podcasts playing in my car, while I work out, walk the dog, and do chores. I’m flushing my glass and feeding my mind. Does this give me an edge over the guy who gets up and reads the newspaper first thing, listens to news radio on his commute to and from work, and watches or scrolls through the evening news before going to bed? You bet it does! And it can for you, too. Fig. 12 Flush out the negative (dirty water) with positive, inspirational, and supportive ideas (clean water). Step 1: Stand Guard Unless you decide to hole up in a cave or on a desert island, you’re going to get dirty water in your glass. It’s going to be on billboards, on CNN while you’re walking through the airport, on the screaming tabloid headlines at the checkout when you’re buying groceries, etc. Even friends, family members, and your own negative mental tapes can flood dirty water into your glass. But that doesn’t mean you can’t take steps to limit your exposure to all that grime. Maybe you can’t avoid the negative posts when you go on social media, but you can limit the amount of time you are logged on. You can refuse to listen to the radio to and from work and instead put on an instructional and inspirational audiobook or podcast. You can put down your phone and talk to your loved ones instead. You can press play on those show recommendations you feel are truly educational and life-affirming—and speed through the commercials aimed at making you feel inadequate or lacking unless you buy more crap. I didn’t really grow up with TV. I remember watching Solid Gold and The A-Team (remember them?), but television wasn’t a big part of our family life. I managed somehow to thrive without it, and that’s given me a clearer perspective when I watch an occasional program now. Sure, I’ll laugh along with the sitcom, but afterward, I feel the same as if I ate fast food—bloated and malnourished. And I can’t get over how commercials prey on our psychology, our fears, pains, needs, and weaknesses. If I walk through life thinking that I’m not enough just as I am—that I need to buy this, that, and the other thing to be okay—how can I expect to create amazing results? It’s estimated that Americans (twelve and older) spend 1,704 hours watching TV per year. That averages out to 4.7 HOURS per day. We’re spending almost 30 percent of our waking hours watching TV. Almost thirty-three hours per week—more than one whole day each week! It’s the equivalent of watching TV for two solid months out of every twelve! WOW! And people wonder why they can’t get ahead in life? Put Yourself on a Media Diet The media thrives on taking us hostage. Ever been stuck on the freeway with traffic backed up for miles, making you late, wondering what the heck’s holding everything up? Sure enough, when you finally get close, you see that nothing physical is blocking the flow of cars. The wreck clearly happened a while ago and has since been moved to the side of the freeway. The 3-mph crawl was caused by people rubbernecking! Now you’re really irritated. But what happens when your car passes the wreck? You slow way down, take your eyes off the road in front of you, and crane your own neck! Why do good, decent people want to see something tragic and grotesque? It’s our genetic heritage, going back to our prehistoric sense of self-preservation. We can’t help ourselves. Even if we’re adept at avoiding negativity, and have trained ourselves to be relentlessly positive, when it comes to sensationalism, our basic nature can’t resist. Media masters understand that. They know your nature, in many ways better than you. The media has always used shocking and sensational headlines to draw attention. But today, instead of three news TV and radio networks, there are hundreds, running 24/7. Instead of a few newspapers, there are endless portals reaching us from our computers to our phones. The competition for your attention has never been bloodier, and the media jockeys continually up the ante in shock value. They find a dozen or so of the most heinous, scandalous, criminal, murderous, bleak, and horrid things that happen in the world each day, and parade them through our papers, news channels, and the Web over and over. Plus, nowadays, anyone with a social media handle can choose to share, spread, and pass on negative stories with a quick click of a button. Meanwhile, during that same twenty-four-hour period, millions of wonderful, beautiful, incredible things have happened. Yet we hear very little about them. Being wired to seek out the negative, we create the demand for more and more. How could the positive news stories ever hope to compete with those ratings, shares, or advertising dollars? Let’s go back to our freeway. Instead of a wreck on the side of the road, what if there was the most stunning, miraculous sunset you’ve ever seen? What would happen to the traffic then? I’ve seen this many times. It whizzes by at top speed. The great danger of the media is that it gives us a very perverted view of the world. Because the focus and the repetition of messaging is on the negative, that’s what our minds start believing. This warped and narrow view of what’s not working has a severe influence on your creative potential. It can be crippling. My Personal Junk Filter I’ll share what I do to safeguard my mind. But I warn you, I have a rigorous mental diet. You’ll want to adjust to your own preferences, but this system has worked beautifully for me. As you might guess, I don’t watch or listen to any news and I don’t read any news feeds or news publications. Ninety-nine percent of all news has no bearing on my personal life or my personal goals, dreams, and ambitions anyway. I have set up a few RSS feeds identifying the news and industry updates that do pertain to my direct interests and goals. The news that’s helpful to me gets plucked out of the fray so I don’t have to get any mud slung into my glass of water. While most people wade through hours of irrelevant garbage that hampers their thinking and crushes their spirit, I get the most productive information I need when I need it, in less than fifteen minutes a day. Step 2: Enroll in Drive-Time U It’s not enough to eliminate negative input. To move in a positive direction, you must flush out the bad and fill up on the good. My car won’t move without two things: gasoline and an ever-present library of instructional podcasts and audiobooks I listen to as I drive. The average American drives about twelve thousand miles a year. That’s three hundred hours of flushing potential right there! Brian Tracy taught me the concept of turning my car into a mobile classroom. He explained to me that by listening to instructional material as I drive, I gain knowledge equivalent to two semesters of an advanced college degree—every year. Think about it. Using the time you’re currently wasting by listening to drive-time radio, you could obtain the equivalent of a Ph.D. in leadership, sales success, wealth building, relationship excellence—or whatever course you choose. This commitment, in combination with your reading routine, separates you from the herd of average—one podcast or book at a time. By the way, if you want a podcast that will give you that positive input you’re looking for, check out DarrenDaily On-Demand wherever you listen to your podcast episodes, or go to DarrenDailyOnDemand.com. I listen to every episode! Not joking. II. Associations: Who’s Influencing You? Birds of a feather flock together. The people with whom you habitually associate are called your “reference group.” According to research by social psychologist Dr. David McClelland of Harvard, your “reference group” determines as much as 95 percent of your success or failure in life. Who do you spend the most time with? Who are the people you most admire? Are those two groups of people exactly the same? If not, why not? Jim Rohn taught that we become the combined average of the five people we hang around the most. Rohn would say we could tell the quality of our health, attitude, and income by looking at the people around us. The people with whom we spend our time determine what conversations dominate our attention, along with the attitudes and opinions we are regularly exposed to. Eventually, we start to eat what they eat, talk like they talk, read what they read, think like they think, watch what they watch, treat people how they treat them, even dress like they dress. The funny thing is, more often than not, we are completely unaware of the similarities between us and our circle of five. How are we not aware? Because your associations don’t shove you in a direction; they nudge you ever so slightly over time. Their influence is so subtle that it’s like being on an inner tube out in the ocean, feeling like you’re floating in place. That is, until you look up and realize the gentle current has pushed you a half-mile down the shore. Think of your friends who order greasy appetizers or a cocktail before dinner, and that’s their routine. Hang out with them enough, and you’ll find yourself grabbing for cheese nachos and potato skins, and joining them for that extra beer or glass of wine. Your pace will suddenly match their pace. Meanwhile, your other friends order healthy food and talk about the inspiring books they’re reading, their new goals, and business aspirations. Soon you begin to assimilate their behaviors and habits. You read and talk about what they talk about. You see the movies they’re excited about and you go to the places they recommend. The influence your friends have over you is subtle and can be positive or negative. Either way, the impact is incredibly powerful. Watch out! You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. So, what is the combined average income, health, or attitudes of the five people you spend most of your time with? Does the answer frighten you? If so, the best way to increase the potential for whatever traits you desire is to spend the majority of your time with people who already possess those traits. You will then see the power of influence work for you, rather than against you. The behaviors and attitudes that helped them acquire the success you admire will begin to become part of your daily routine. Hang around them long enough and you’re likely to realize similar successful outcomes in your life. If you haven’t already, jot down the names of those five people you hang around the most. Also write down their main characteristics, both positive and negative. It doesn’t matter who they are. It could be your spouse, your brother, your neighbor, or your assistant. Now, average them out. What’s their average health and bank balance? What’s their average relationship like? As you look at the results, ask yourself, “Is this list okay for me? Is this where I want to go?” It’s time to reappraise and reprioritize the people you spend time with. These relationships can nurture you, starve you, or keep you stuck. Now that you’ve started to carefully consider who you spend your time with, let’s go a little deeper. As Jim Rohn taught me, it’s powerful to evaluate and shift your associations into three categories: dissociations, limited associations, and expanded associations. DOWNLOAD THE ASSOCIATION EVALUATOR WORKSHEET BY VISITING THECOMPOUNDEFFECT.COM/RESOURCES Dissociations You guard against the influences your children are exposed to and the people they hang around. You are aware of the influence these people could have on your children and the choices they might make as a result. I believe this same principle should apply to you! You already know this: There are some people you might need to break away from. Completely. This might not be an easy step to take, but it’s essential. You have to make the hard choice not to let certain negative influences affect you anymore. Determine the quality of life you want to have and then surround yourself with the people who represent and support that vision. I’m constantly weeding out people who refuse to grow and live positively. Growing and changing your associations is a lifelong process. Some people might say I’m too rigorous about it, but I’d like to be more so. I had a business relationship with someone I really liked, but when the economy got difficult, most of his conversation was focused on how horrible everything was, how much his company was feeling the hit, and how hard it was out there. I said, “Man, you’ve got to stop working on your presentation about how bad life is. I can hear you collecting all the data points to reinforce your beliefs.” He persisted in seeing everything as more dour and hopeless than it was. I decided we had no business doing business together. When you make the tough decision to put up boundaries between you and people who drag you down, realize that they’ll fight you—especially those closest to you. Your decision to live a more positive, goal-oriented life will hold a mirror up to their own poor choices. You will make them uncomfortable and they will attempt to pull you back down to their level. Their resistance doesn’t mean they don’t love you or want the best for you—it’s actually not about you at all. It’s about their fear and guilt about their own poor choices and lack of discipline. Just know that breaking away won’t be easy. Limited Associations There are some people you can spend three hours with, but not three days. Others you can spend three minutes with, but not three hours. Always remember that the influence of associations is both powerful and subtle. The person you’re walking with can determine whether you slow your pace or quicken it, literally and figuratively. Similarly, you can’t help but be touched by the dominant attitudes, actions, and behaviors of the people with whom you spend time. Decide how much you can “afford” to be influenced, based on how those people represent themselves. This is difficult, I know. I have had to do this on several occasions, even with close family members. I WILL NOT, however, allow someone else’s actions or attitudes to have a dampening influence on me. I once had a neighbor who was deemed a three-minute friend. For three minutes, we could have a great chit-chat, but we wouldn’t mesh for three hours. I can hang out with an old high-school friend for three hours, but he’s not a three-day guy. And, then there are some people I can hang around for a few days, but wouldn’t go on an extended vacation with. Take a look at your relationships. Make sure you’re not spending three hours with a three-minute person. Expanded Associations We’ve just talked about weeding out negative influencers. While you’re doing that, you’ll also want to reach out. Identify people who have positive qualities in the areas of life where you want to improve—people with the financial and business success you desire, the parenting skills you want, the relationships you yearn for, the lifestyle you love. And then spend more time with them. Join organizations, businesses, and health clubs where these people gather and make friends. Ahead, you’ll see how I even used to drive to a different town to spend quality time—with fortuitous results. I rave about Jim Rohn throughout this book. Aside from my father, Jim remains my foremost mentor and influencer. My relationship with Jim perfectly exemplifies an expanded association. While I got to share a few private meals and spend a little time with him during our interviews and backstage before events, most of my time with Jim was spent listening to him in my car or reading his words in my living room. I have spent more than a thousand hours getting direct instruction from Jim, and 99 percent of that was through books and audio programs. What’s exciting about that is, no matter where you are in your life—maybe busy at home with small children or caretaking aging parents, working long hours with people with whom you have little in common, or living out in the country far from the nearest office building—you, too, can have almost any mentor you want, if he or she has gathered their best thoughts, stories, and ideas into books, videos, and podcasts. You have an unlimited bounty from which to draw. Take advantage of it. Now people often reach out to my assistant in order to get my advice or mentorship. All she has to do is tell them it’s all already available from anywhere in the world through DarrenDaily or inside our Darren Hardy Training Vault. If you want to have a better, deeper, more meaningful relationship, ask yourself, “Who has the type of relationship I want? How can I spend (more) time with that person? Who can I meet who can positively influence me?” Let their glow rub off on you. Befriend the person you think is the biggest, baddest, most successful person in your field. What do they read? Where do they go for lunch? How can that association influence you? You can build these expanded associations by joining networking groups and even online communities. Find the charity organizations, symphonies, and clubs where the people you want to emulate gather. Find a Peak-Performance Partner Another way to increase your exposure to expanded associations is by teaming up with a peak performance partner, someone equally committed to study and personal growth as you. This person should be someone you trust, someone bold enough to tell you what they really think about you, your attitudes, and your performance. It could be that this person is a longtime friend, or it may be someone who doesn’t know you well at all. The point is to get (and give) an unbiased, honest, outside perspective. My longtime “accountability partner” is my good friend Landon Taylor. As I mentioned before, we have a thirty-minute call every Friday to discuss our weekly wins, losses, fixes, “ah-has,” and where we are on our growth plans. The anticipation of the call and knowing I have to be accountable to Landon keeps me extra committed throughout the week. I make a record of Landon’s losses or any feedback he needs and make sure to ask him about it the next week. He does the same for me. That way we hold each other accountable. He might say, “Okay, you screwed up here last week and admitted it and committed to change. What did you do about that this week?” Life is life. We’re both busy executives, but it’s amazing to me that we actually end up doing this every week without fail. It’s not easy. Sometimes I’ll be flying through my day and think, “Oh, crud! I have to do this.” But often in the middle of the call, I’ll think, “I’m so glad we’re having this conversation!” Even in preparing for it, and thinking of my big wins and losses for the week, I learn about myself. This week I told Landon, “You know, I’m in the middle of so many things. I’m writing my book. I’m having a lot of realizations, and so many ah-has, but not one thing that’s really compelling.” He said, “Let this be the last week that you don’t come to the table with an ah-ha.” Gulp. “Don’t shortchange me,” he said. Point taken. In reality, I was shortchanging myself by not identifying one thing memorable enough to share. I have a serious challenge for you if you’re up for it. Want real feedback? Find people who care enough about you to be brutally honest with you. Ask them these questions: “How do I show up to you? What do you think my strengths are? In what areas do you think I can improve? Where do you think I sabotage myself? What’s one thing I can stop doing that would benefit me the most? What’s the one thing I should start doing?” Invest in Mentorship Paul J. Meyer is another man who served as a mentor to me. Paul passed away in 2009 at age eighty-one. Whenever I thought I was really doing well, really playing at a high level, I’d get around Paul—he was my reality check. What he did before lunch was mind-boggling to me. I got to spend a lot of time with him. Paul bought one of my companies and I also conducted a turnaround for one of his companies. He was a very powerful spirit in my life. After spending a couple of hours with Paul, hearing about all his plans, ventures, and activities, my head would spin. Just trying to make sense of all he had going on exhausted me. After time with Paul, I’d want to go take a nap! But my association with him raised my game. His walking pace was my running pace. It expanded my ideas about how big I could play and how ambitious I could be. You have to get around people like that! You’re never too good for a mentor. My friend Harvey Mackay told me, “I have had twenty coaches, if you can believe it. I have a speech coach, I have a writing coach, I have a humor coach, I’ve got a language coach, and on and on.” I have always found it interesting that the most successful people, the truly top performers, are the ones willing to hire and pay for the best coaches and trainers there are. It pays to invest in your improved performance. Finding and engaging a mentor doesn’t need to be a mysterious or intimidating process either. When I sat down with Ken Blanchard, he explained the simplicity of engaging a mentor: “The first thing you want to remember with a mentor is that it doesn’t need to take a lot of their time. The best advice I’ve ever gotten is in short clips, having lunch or breakfast with somebody, just telling them what I’m working on and asking their advice. You will be amazed how successful businesspeople are willing to be mentors to people when it’s not taking a lot of time.” John Wooden reinforced that point to me when he shared, “Mentoring is your true legacy. It is the greatest inheritance you can give to others. And it should never end. It is why you get up every day. To teach and be taught.” He went on to explain that mentorship is also a two-way street. “An individual needs to be open to being mentored. It is our responsibility to be willing to allow our lives and our minds to be touched, molded, and strengthened by the people who surround us.” Develop Your Own Personal Board of Advisors As part of my plan to be wiser, more strategic, operate more effectively, and expand the time I have with high-minded leaders, I developed a board of advisors in my personal life. I hand-selected a dozen people because of their areas of expertise, creative thinking ability, and/or my great respect for who they are. Once a week I reach out to a few of them and solicit ideas, run thoughts by them, and ask for feedback and input. Having started this process, I can tell you the benefits I’ve already received have been profound—far more than I anticipated! It’s surprising the genius people are willing to share when you show sincere interest. Who should be on your personal board of advisors? Seek out positive people who have achieved the success you want to create in your own life. Remember the adage: “Never ask advice of someone with whom you wouldn’t want to trade places.” III. Environment: Changing Your View Changes Your Perspective When I was in real estate, working in the San Francisco Bay area, I lived and worked within a very limited demographic. I saw the same kinds of people operating at the same level over and over. I needed to find an elevated circle of associations in order to go where I wanted to go. I started driving across the bay to one of the richest and most beautiful spots on the planet, Tiburon in Marin County, north of San Francisco. If you’ve ever been to Monaco, that’s what Tiburon looks like, but far quainter. It’s a spectacular spot. I would go to a delightful seafood restaurant, Sam’s on the Wharf. The food was great, but more importantly, the restaurant was popular with the area’s more affluent residents. Aside from going to Sam’s to expand my associations, I’d also sit on the wharf and look up at the hillside. I was mesmerized by the multimillion-dollar houses that hung off the cliffs. One in particular always caught my eye—a blue, four-story home with an elevator and a whale lightning rod at the top. What would be the perfect house? I used to ask myself all the time. If someone could just give me one of them, which one would I pick? The answer was always the same—this beautiful blue one. It was in the perfect spot with a bright vista, the best of the bunch. On my way home from brunch one morning, I saw an open house sign and thought it’d be fun to check it out. One sign led to another as I followed them zigzagging up the cliffs along the narrow streets. I finally reached the top of the hill and found the advertised home. As I entered and walked up to a spectacular bay window, the world opened up in front of me—the peninsula tip of Tiburon, Angel Island across the Bay, Berkeley and the East Bay, the Bay Bridge, and the entire San Francisco skyline over to the Golden Gate Bridge in a 300-degree expanse. I walked out onto the balcony and looked around. Suddenly I realized that this was the very house I’d been looking at for years! This was the blue house! I signed the contract on the spot. My dream house was now mine! I can’t really say that I met anybody at Sam’s who changed my life. However, that environment had a powerful effect on me. Seeing those homes up on the cliffs fueled my ambition and expanded my dreams. I ended up working harder than I ever thought possible to make those dreams come true—and they did! The dream in your heart may be bigger than the environment in which you find yourself. Sometimes you have to get out of that environment to see that dream fulfilled. It’s like planting an oak sapling in a pot. Once it becomes rootbound, its growth is limited. It needs a great space to become a mighty oak. So do you. When I talk about your environment, I’m not only referring to where you live. I’m referring to whatever surrounds you. Creating a positive environment to support your success means clearing out all the clutter in your life. Not only the physical clutter that makes it hard for you to work productively and efficiently (although that’s important too!), but also the psychic clutter of whatever around you isn’t working, whatever’s broken, whatever makes you cringe. Each and every incomplete piece of your life exerts a draining force on you, sucking the energy of accomplishment and success out of you as surely as a vampire stealing your blood. Every incomplete promise, commitment, and agreement saps your strength because it blocks your momentum and inhibits your ability to move forward. Incomplete tasks keep calling you back to the past to take care of them. So think about what you can complete today. Additionally, when you’re creating an environment to support your goals, remember that you get in life what you tolerate. This is true in every area of your life—particularly within your relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. What you have decided to tolerate is also reflected in the situations and circumstances of your life right now. Put another way, you will get in life what you accept and expect you are worthy of. If you tolerate disrespect, you will be disrespected. If you tolerate people being late and making you wait, people will show up late for you. If you tolerate being underpaid and overworked, that will continue for you. If you tolerate your body being overweight, tired, and perpetually sick, it will be. It’s amazing how life will organize around the standards you set for yourself. Some people think they’re the victims of other people’s behavior, but in actuality, we have control over how people treat us. Protect your emotional, mental, and physical space. Then you can live with peace, rather than in the chaos and stress the world will hurl upon you. If you want to foster a disciplined routine of rhythms and consistency, so that Big Mo not only pays a visit to your house, but moves in, you have to be sure your environment is welcoming and supportive of you becoming, doing, and performing at world-class levels. While we’re on the topic of world-class, in the next chapter, I want to help you take everything you’ve learned thus far and give you the secret to accelerate your results. Achieving greater results with only a little more effort may feel a little like cheating or an unfair advantage. But who said life was fair?","completion":"The passage you provided details the strong influence that choices, behaviors, and habits have on one's life, emphasizing the role of external forces. It suggests vigilance in managing these influences to ensure a positive life trajectory. There are three main areas of influence: 1. Input: The information you feed your mind can significantly affect your productivity and creativity. Consistently negative input like distressing news or trivial media content can foster a negative mindset, as your brain is hardwired to focus on survival and thus, potential threats. To counteract this, you should consciously seek out positive, inspirational, and educational materials to reprogram your mind for success. 2. Associations: The people you surround yourself with can greatly determine your success or failure. It's important to evaluate and categorize relationships into three areas: - Dissociations: Eliminate or limit contact with people who have a negative influence on your life. - Limited Associations: Spend less time with those who may not be as aligned with your goals but are a part of your life. - Expanded Associations: Increase your time with those who embody the traits and success you seek. This can include finding a mentor or joining groups that share your aspirations. 3. Environment: The physical and psychic surroundings also play a critical role. A positive environment is clutter-free and supportive of your goals. It reflects your standards and what you are willing to tolerate in life, and it impacts your emotional and mental well-being. The passage also highlights the importance of being proactive in shaping these influences. The following actions are recommended: - Consume quality input by selecting educational and positive content. - Carefully choose the people you associate with, aiming to spend time with those who are where you aspire to be. - Create and maintain an environment that supports your progress and reflects your personal standards. - Consider engaging with mentors, forming a personal board of advisors, and finding a performance partner for accountability and growth. Ultimately, the message is clear: to succeed and foster personal development, one must take full responsibility for their life by consciously managing these three areas of influence."},{"prompt":"more","completion":"From the passage provided, it can be discerned that actively managing one's influences is critical for personal and professional growth. Here are some additional insights and detailed strategies for implementing the suggested ideas: **Implementing Positive Input:** - Begin each day with educational or motivational content. - Limit exposure to negative media by choosing specific times for consumption or cutting them out entirely. - Replace commute or idle time with personal development podcasts, audiobooks, or programs like DarrenDaily to enrich your mind. **Managing Associations:** - Assess your relationships by writing down the five people you spend the most time with and note their main attributes, to understand their influence on your life. - Consciously choose to spend more time with individuals who embody the success and values you admire. - Establish boundaries with negative individuals, which may necessitate difficult decisions, such as reducing or cutting off contact. **Enhancing Your Environment:** - Declutter and organize your physical space to create an environment conducive to productivity. - Ensure your personal environment reflects the level of success and wellness you desire. - Be willing to step out of your current environment to experience new perspectives and opportunities, like the example of visiting a more affluent area to expand one's vision and ambition. **Action Steps:** 1. Conduct a thorough audit of your daily input, associations, and environment using the provided worksheets or by creating your own system. 2. Prioritize and set goals for each category, identifying what changes need to be made and establishing clear steps to achieve them. 3. Set boundaries to protect your mental and emotional energy from negative influences. 4. Identify mentors and role models in your desired field and actively seek their guidance and inspiration. 5. Create a personal accountability system by finding a like-minded partner or forming a mastermind group to help ensure you stay on track. 6. Continuously review and adjust your strategies for managing influences to better align with your evolving goals and aspirations. Remember, it's not just about removing negative influences but about actively seeking and adding positive ones. This process is ongoing and requires regular reflection and adjustment. As your goals and personal circumstances change, so too may your influences, and it's vital to revisit these points regularly to ensure they continue to serve your best interests."},{"prompt":"diet about short comedy","completion":"I'm not entirely sure what you mean by \\"diet about short comedy.\\" However, I'll provide two interpretations of your request: 1. If you're asking for a short comedy piece (like a sketch or joke) that revolves around the concept of dieting, here's an example that plays on the humorous side of diet struggles: Sketch Title: \\"The Diet Cheat Day\\" Characters: - Pat, a dieter who's been struggling to stick to their strict diet. - Sam, Pat's supportive but mischievous friend. [Pat enters, looking distressed and clutching a nutritional plan.] Pat: \\"I can't take it anymore, Sam! I've been on this kale and quinoa diet for weeks. I dream of cheeseburgers dancing around my head.\\" Sam: \\"Well, you know what they say, a cheat day is good for the soul. Keeps your metabolism guessing!\\" Pat: [Eyes light up] \\"Really? A whole day when I can eat anything?\\" Sam: \\"Sure!

If you're asking for advice on diet tips that are humorous or presented in a comedic format, you might consider searching for comedians who have routines on dieting or health. These comedians often share funny anecdotes about their own experiences with diets, gym struggles, and the absurdities they encounter trying to lead a healthier lifestyle. While comedy can provide a light-hearted take on the often fraught subject of dieting, it's important to remember that diet and nutrition are personal and should be approached with care and consideration for one's health needs.

Рассмотрим пример, где данные корректны, но штриховка не видна: \`\`\`python # Создаем случайный датафрейм для примера import pandas as pd import numpy as np np.random.seed(0) res_stat = pd.DataFrame({ 'delta_gini': np.linspace(0, 1, 100), 'delta_1p': np.random.normal(0.5, 0.1, 100), 'delta_1p_left': np.random.normal(0.4, 0.1, 100), 'delta_1p_right': np.random.normal(0.6, 0.1, 100) }) # Убедитесь, что левая граница всегда ниже, а правая - выше res_stat['delta_1p_left'] = np.minimum(res_stat['delta_1p_left'], res_stat['delta_1p']) res_stat['delta_1p_right'] = np.maximum(res_stat['delta_1p_right'], res_stat['delta_1p']) sns.lineplot(res_stat.delta_gini, res_stat.delta_1p, label='ROI delta_1p') sns.lineplot(res_stat.delta_gini, res_stat.delta_1p_left, label='ROI delta_1p_left', linestyle='--') sns.lineplot(res_stat.delta_gini, res_stat.delta_1p_right, label='ROI delta_1p_right', linestyle='--') # Заштриховка зоны доверительного интервала plt.fill_between(res_stat.delta_gini, res_stat.delta_1p_left, res_stat.delta_1p_right, color='gray', alpha=0.5) # Выводим легенду plt.legend() # Отображаем график plt.show() \`\`\` Если даже после этих проверок штриховка все еще невидима, укажите версии библиотек Seaborn и Matplotlib и попробуйте их обновить: \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade seaborn matplotlib \`\`\` Попробуйте повторно выполнять код после обновления, чтобы узнать, решится ли проблема."},{"prompt":"Как сделать так, чтобы график средней доходности дефолтников был отдельным и располагался справа от двух других? earn = rd[rd['ROI'].notna()]['full_balance'] - rd[rd['ROI'].notna()]['totalsum'] rd['earn'] = earn stat1 = (rd.groupby('app_date_month')['earn'].mean() / 1e3).reset_index() stat2 = (rd[rd.target_orm == 0].groupby('app_date_month')['earn'].mean() / 1e3).reset_index() stat3 = (rd[rd.target_orm == 1].groupby('app_date_month')['earn'].mean() / 1e3).reset_index() sns.lineplot(stat1.app_date_month, stat1.earn, label='Средняя доходность') sns.lineplot(stat2.app_date_month, stat2.earn, label=f'Средняя доходность недефолтников', linestyle='--') sns.lineplot(stat3.app_date_month, stat3.earn, label=f'Средняя доходность дефолтников', linestyle='--') # Выводим легенду plt.legend() plt.show()","completion":"Вы можете использовать функцию \`plt.subplots\` для создания отдельного графика (акса) и расположить его справа от двух других.

Также используется \`gridspec_kw\` с \`width_ratios\`, который устанавливает соотношение ширины этих колонок. Вы можете изменить это соотношение как вам угодно. Обратите внимание, что в примере показано три графика, каждый из которых посвящен своей статистике. Если вы хотите расположить графики вертикально, используйте параметр \`nrows=3, ncols=1\` в \`plt.subplots()\` и адаптируйте расположение с помощью \`gridspec_kw={'height_ratios': [1, 1, 2]}\` для задания соотношения высоты. Если ваша цель — сделать два левых графика в одном аксе (один над другим) и третий график направо от них, вы можете использовать \`gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [2, 1]}\` и объединить первые два \`axes\` вертикально с помощью \`fig.add_subplot()\` или \`plt.subplot2grid()\` с соответствующими аргументами."},{"prompt":"как сделать так, чтобы на представленной гистограмме на оси Y вместо абсолютного количества наблюдений была доля наблюдений от всего количетсва? dos = (rd[(rd.issue_flag==1) & (rd.closed_flag == 1)]['close_m_beg'] / rd[(rd.issue_flag==1) & (rd.closed_flag == 1)]['end_m_beg']) dos = dos[dos <= 1] dos.hist()","completion":"Чтобы показать долю наблюдений на оси Y вместо абсолютного количества, вам нужно использовать параметр \`weights\` метода \`hist()\` из Matplotlib, который позволяет веса для каждого значения в датасете.
