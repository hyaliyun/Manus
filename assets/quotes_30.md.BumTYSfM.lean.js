In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to what befits my new age. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. Keep an age tracker.

However, I construct a cube of a given edge and then I look if the points of the cube are inside the tetrahedron. This procedure is quite inefficient: can you please suggest me some way to optimize such way? An idea can be to direct construct a grid inside the tetrahedron of a given discretization step, instead of construct a cube and then look if a point is inside the tetrahedron.","completion":"Yes, directly constructing a grid inside the tetrahedron is indeed a more efficient approach than creating a cube and checking each point to see if it lies inside the tetrahedron. Here's a method to achieve this more efficiently, focusing on a regular tetrahedron for simplicity. Adjustments can be made for irregular tetrahedrons, keeping in mind the core concepts. # General Concept The approach involves generating points directly within the tetrahedron by leveraging its geometric properties. The key is to iterate through a fraction of space that minimally bounds the tetrahedron and to calculate points based on the tetrahedron’s vertices. This is done by constructing linear combinations of the tetrahedron’s vertices, which guarantees that generated points lie inside it. # Steps for a Regular Tetrahedron For a regular tetrahedron (or with minor adjustments, any tetrahedron), we can use the barycentric coordinates system. Each point inside the tetrahedron can be expressed as a combination of its four vertices (V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4), with weights (t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4) that sum to 1 and are all in the range ([0, 1]). 1. **Vertices Definition**: Define the vertices (V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4) of the tetrahedron. 2. **Discretization Step**: Choose a discretization step (Delta t) which determines the resolution of the grid. 3. **Barycentric Coordinates**: Loop through all possible combinations of (t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4) that adhere to the conditions mentioned above, with step (Delta t). Only continue to generate a point if the sum of these parameters is (leq 1) to ensure the point lies inside the tetrahedron. 4. **Point Computation**: For each valid combination of (t_i), compute the point P as a linear combination of the vertices with the determined barycentric coordinates: [P = t_1 cdot V_1 + t_2 cdot V_2 + t_3 cdot V_3 + t_4 cdot V_4] 5. **Iteration and Collection**: Iterate over all valid barycentric coordinate combinations to compute and collect the points inside the tetrahedron. # Python Pseudocode Here's a simplified example in Python: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Define vertices of the tetrahedron V1 = np.array([0, 0, 0]) V2 = np.array([1, 0, 0]) V3 = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/2, 0]) V4 = np.array([0.5, np.sqrt(3)/6, np.sqrt(6)/3]) # Discretization step delta_t = 0.1 # Adjust as needed for finer or coarser grid points = [] for t1 in np.arange(0, 1, delta_t): for t2 in np.arange(0, 1 - t1, delta_t): for t3 in np.arange(0, 1 - (t1 + t2), delta_t): t4 = 1 - (t1 + t2 + t3) point = t1 * V1 + t2 * V2 + t3 * V3 + t4 * V4 points.append(point) points = np.array(points) print(f\\"Generated {len(points)} points inside the tetrahedron.\\") \`\`\` This method is more direct and eliminates the need to check whether each point in a larger cubic volume lies within the tetrahedron. Adjustments may be required for specific applications, especially when dealing with irregular tetrahedrons, but the fundamental approach of utilizing barycentric coordinates remains invaluable."},{"prompt":"Can you please provide me such code in Octave scripting language?","completion":"Certainly! Translating the Python pseudocode for generating points inside a tetrahedron into Octave requires minor adjustments, mainly due to differences in array handling and function names between Python and Octave. Here is how you can do it in Octave: \`\`\`octave # Define vertices of the tetrahedron V1 = [0, 0, 0]; V2 = [1, 0, 0]; V3 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0]; V4 = [0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(6)/3]; # Discretization step delta_t = 0.1; # Adjust as needed points = []; # Initialize points array for t1 = 0:delta_t:1 for t2 = 0:delta_t:(1 - t1) for t3 = 0:delta_t:(1 - (t1 + t2)) t4 = 1 - (t1 + t2 + t3); point = t1 * V1 + t2 * V2 + t3 * V3 + t4 * V4; points = [points; point]; # Append point endfor endfor endfor disp([\\"Generated \\", num2str(size(points, 1)), \\" points inside the tetrahedron.\\"]); \`\`\` This Octave script follows a similar logic to the Python version: 1. **Vertices Definition**: The vertices (V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4) of the tetrahedron are defined as row vectors. 2. **Discretization Step**: The variable \`delta_t\` controls the step size between points in the grid. A smaller \`delta_t\` will produce more points but increase computation time. 3. **Looping with Barycentric Coordinates**: The nested loops iterate through possible values of (t_1, t_2,) and (t_3), respecting the barycentric coordinate conditions. (t_4) is calculated to ensure the sum is 1. 4. **Point Calculation**: Each point inside the tetrahedron is calculated as a linear combination of the tetrahedron's vertices, and the points are stored in the \`points\` array. 5. **Result**: The script displays the number of generated points. This script should be run in an Octave environment. Octave's syntax for array operations and looping structures is quite similar to MATLAB, making scripts like this one fairly straightforward for those familiar with MATLAB."},{"prompt":"Thank you for the code. Does this code generate unique points or a point can be found multiple times in array points?","completion":"The provided Octave code is designed to generate unique points. This uniqueness is ensured by the nature of how the points are generated: 1. **Discretization and Iteration**: The code systematically iterates through the barycentric coordinates (\`t1\`, \`t2\`, \`t3\`, and \`t4\`) with a fixed increment (\`delta_t\`). For each iteration, it computes a single point inside the tetrahedron based on the current combination of \`t1\`, \`t2\`, \`t3\`, and implicitly \`t4\`. Since each combination of \`t1\`, \`t2\`, \`t3\`, and \`t4\` is unique within the loop (because of the discrete steps controlled by \`delta_t\` and the way the loops are constructed), each generated point will also be unique. 2. **Combination Uniqueness**: The uniqueness of each combination comes from the fact that \`t1\`, \`t2\`, and \`t3\` are systematically varied within specified ranges, and \`t4\` is accordingly computed to make sure the sum \`t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = 1\`. Given that this sum is a fundamental property of barycentric coordinates for a point inside a tetrahedron, and considering the loop's incremental nature, it's guaranteed that no two loops will generate the same barycentric coordinate set (and thus the same point) unless \`delta_t\` is not properly adjusted (e.g., floating-point precision issues, which are highly unlikely with reasonable choices for \`delta_t\`). 3. **Floating-point Considerations**: In the realm of floating-point arithmetic, there's always a potential concern about numerical precision. However, given the straightforward calculation and iteration approach, numerical issues leading to duplicate points are practically nonexistent in this context. Each step increments precisely by \`delta_t\`, leading to distinct barycentric coordinates and, by extension, distinct points in space. In summary, provided that \`delta_t\` is chosen appropriately, the script guarantees the generation of unique points as per its design. The systematic approach to iterating through barycentric coordinates within their valid ranges ensures that each set of coordinates (and thus each point) is generated exactly once."},{"prompt":"Thank you. How can I cycle over array points?","completion":"Cycling over the array \`points\` that contains the generated points inside the tetrahedron can be achieved by using a simple loop in Octave. Each row in the \`points\` array represents a different point, with the columns representing the x, y, and z coordinates of that point, respectively. Here's how you can cycle over the \`points\` array and access each point's coordinates: \`\`\`octave # Assume 'points' is already filled with the generated points inside the tetrahedron # Cycling over the points array for i = 1:size(points, 1) # Access the current point currentPoint = points(i, :); # Extract x, y, z coordinates of the current point x = currentPoint(1); y = currentPoint(2); z = currentPoint(3); # Example usage: Displaying each point's coordinates disp([\\"Point #\\", num2str(i), \\": (\\", num2str(x), \\", \\", num2str(y), \\", \\", num2str(z), \\")\\"]); endfor \`\`\` This loop iterates over each row in the \`points\` array from the first row to the last row (\`size(points, 1)\` gives the number of rows, which corresponds to the number of points). For every iteration, it selects the current point (\`currentPoint = points(i, :)\`) and extracts its x, y, and z coordinates directly by accessing the relevant columns in \`currentPoint\`. Within the loop, you can perform any operations you need with each point's coordinates, such as computing distances, performing further geometric transformations, or displaying the points as shown in the example. Remember, this code assumes that \`points\` has been previously populated with points generated as per your tetrahedron generation code. The looping mechanism is a straightforward approach to iterate over arrays in Octave, similar to how you would do it in many other programming languages."},{"prompt":"Напиши план на тему Методики решения проблем 8D в кправлении качеством продукции","completion":"**План: Методики решения проблем 8D в управлении качеством продукции** 1.

Essa obra compõe-se de uma série de narrativas que, através de mitos e lendas, exploram o tema da transformação. Embora alguns desses tragam elementos que poderiam ser considerados hoje como explícitos ou +18 dentro dos seus contextos históricos e mitológicos, é crucial abordá-los com o devido respeito ao seu valor cultural e literário, ao invés de meramente focar no aspecto adulto. Um desses contos que carrega uma temática adulta, ainda que envolta em uma rica tapeçaria de simbolismo e significância cultural, é a história de Júpiter (Zeus na mitologia grega) e Io. Contarei uma versão abreviada e suavizada deste conto: --- **A História de Júpiter e Io** Io era uma bela ninfa, da qual Júpiter (o rei dos deuses romanos) se tornou extremamente enamorado. Para protegê-la da ira de sua esposa, Juno (Hera na mitologia grega), e para ocultar seu adultério, Júpiter transformou Io em uma linda novilha branca. Entretanto, Juno não foi facilmente enganada e, percebendo a transformação, pediu a Júpiter que lhe desse a novilha como presente. Uma vez como dona de Io, Juno encarregou Argos, um gigante de cem olhos, de vigiá-la constantemente. Júpiter, movido por sua afeição por Io e desejoso de libertá-la, enviou Mercúrio (Hermes na mitologia grega) para resgatá-la. Mercúrio conseguiu embalar Argos no sono com o som de sua lira e então o matou, libertando Io. Como vingança, Juno enviou um tábano (um tipo de mosca) para perseguir e picar Io incessantemente, fazendo-a vagar por muitas partes do mundo em agonia. A história de Io é apenas uma entre as muitas que em \\"As Metamorfoses\\" exploram temas de desejo, traição, transformação e conflito entre os deuses. Como na maioria desses contos, há um desfecho, no qual Io é finalmente restaurada à sua forma humana e dá à luz a Épafo, resultado de sua união com Júpiter. --- Ao interpretar estes antigos mitos, é essencial lembrar que eles refletem as crenças, os valores e os comportamentos das civilizações que os criaram, e frequentemente carregam lições morais ou filosóficas profundas. A complexidade dos personagens e seus dilemas transcendem a questão do conteúdo explicitamente adulto, mergulhando no coração da experiência humana e suas inúmeras transformações."},{"prompt":"Привет!","completion":"Привет!

Эта конфигурация позволяет эффективно разделять сеть на несколько логических сегментов для повышения безопасности и организации сетевого трафика. Каждая логическая подсеть (VLAN) может быть назначена своему сабинтерфейсу, что позволяет маршрутизатору корректно обрабатывать трафик между разными VLAN, используя технологию межсетевого взаимодействия (Inter-VLAN routing). Если вам необходимо ограничить трафик между различными VLAN, вы можете использовать несколько методов: 1. **Создание Межсетевого Экрана (Firewall):** Большинство современных маршрутизаторов позволяют настраивать правила для контроля и управления трафиком между сабинтерфейсами. Вы можете создать правила, которые будут разрешать или запрещать определенный трафик, основываясь на IP-адресах, портах или других параметрах. 2. **Использование Списков Контроля Доступа (Access Control Lists, ACLs):** ACLs позволяют детально настроить, какой трафик может пересекать интерфейс маршрутизатора. Вы можете создать ACL для каждого сабинтерфейса, указывая, какие типы трафика разрешены или запрещены между различными VLAN. 3. **VLAN Access Maps:** Этот метод позволяет управлять доступом и ограничивать трафик между VLAN на уровне коммутатора (Layer 2). С помощью VLAN Access Maps вы можете фильтровать трафик, не позволяя ему попадать на маршрутизатор для межсетевой маршрутизации. 4. **Private VLANs:** Private VLANs (PVLANs) предоставляют еще один уровень изоляции в пределах одного VLAN. PVLANы позволяют ограничить, какие устройства внутри VLAN могут взаимодействовать друг с другом, обеспечивая дополнительный уровень безопасности. Выбор метода зависит от ваших конкретных требований к безопасности и управления трафиком, а также от оборудования, которое вы используете. Важно тщательно продумать вашу сетевую архитектуру и требования к безопасности перед тем, как реализовать какие-либо настройки ограничений трафика."},{"prompt":"Стоит ли использовать маску с максимальной утилизацией на предприятии или стоит ограничиться стандартной /24?","completion":"Вопрос о выборе размера сети и маски подсети является важным аспектом при планировании и развертывании сетевой инфраструктуры на предприятии. Выбор между использованием маски с максимальной утилизацией адресного пространства и стандартной маской /24 (255.255.255.0) зависит от множества факторов, включая размер предприятия, требования к будущему росту, необходимость в сегментации сети, а также требования к безопасности и управлению. # Преимущества и недостатки использования маски с максимальной утилизацией: **Преимущества:** - **Эффективное использование IP адресного пространства:** Максимальная утилизация позволяет использовать адресное пространство без ненужного перерасхода, что особенно актуально для больших сетей и в случаях ограниченности внешних IP адресов. - **Точная настройка сетевой сегментации:** Может потребоваться для выполнения специфических требований к сегментации или безопасности. **Недостатки:** - **Сложность управления:** Чем точнее сегментация, тем сложнее управление и обслуживание сети. - **Ограниченный простор для роста:** Максимально утилизированные подсети могут создать трудности с расширением сети в будущем. # Преимущества и недостатки использования стандартной маски /24: **Преимущества:** - **Простота управления:** Маска /24 создает пространство для 254 хостов в подсети, делая сеть очень удобной для администрирования. - **Гибкость для расширения:** В большинстве случаев предоставляет достаточно места для текущих потребностей и будущего роста в пределах одной подсети. - **Удобство для стандартных аппликаций:** Многие сетевые приложения и устройства настроены с учетом использования стандартных размеров подсети, что упрощает их интеграцию. **Недостатки:** - **Неэффективное использование IP адресного пространства:** Может привести к ненужному расходу адресного пространства, особенно если большинство подсетей используют далеко не все 254 возможных адреса. - **Более низкая гранулярность сегментации:** Больший размер подсети может сделать менее эффективной сегментацию сети с точки зрения безопасности и управления трафиком. # Выбор маски для предприятия Выбор зависит от конкретных потребностей вашего бизнеса. Для малых и средних предприятий стандартная маска /24 часто предоставляет хороший баланс между управляемостью и гибкостью. Однако для крупного предприятия с большим количеством подразделений или для компании с высокими требованиями к сегментации и безопасности может потребоваться использование маски с максимальной утилизацией адресного пространства для более точной настройки подсетей. В любом случае, важно тщательно спланировать сетевую архитектуру, учитывая текущие и будущие потребности, а также принципы организации и безопасности сети."},{"prompt":"Нужен ли DNS сервер в организации, если да то зачем","completion":"DNS сервер (Domain Name System сервер) играет крайне важную роль в любой сети, включая корпоративные сети организаций. Вот основные причины, по которым организации могут захотеть иметь внутренний DNS сервер: # 1. Улучшение производительности Локальный DNS сервер может кешировать запросы, которые были недавно выполнены. Это означает, что повторные запросы к этим же доменам будут обрабатываться гораздо быстрее, поскольку ответы уже будут находиться в локальном кеше, что снижает нагрузку на внешний интернет-канал и уменьшает задержку. # 2. Управление и контроль Наличие собственного DNS сервера дает организации полный контроль над своей сетевой инфраструктурой. Это позволяет администраторам точно настраивать и управлять тем, как разрешаются доменные имена, а также легко реализовывать внутренний разрешение имен, специфичных для компании. # 3. Безопасность В организации собственный DNS сервер может помочь улучшить общую безопасность. Он может блокировать доступ к определенным нежелательным или опасным сайтам на уровне DNS, предотвращать фишинг и другие виды атак, основанных на манипуляции DNS. DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) также легче реализовать и управлять на внутреннем уровне. # 4. Локализация ресурсов В организациях часто используются внутренние веб-сайты, базы данных, серверы почты и другие ресурсы, не предназначенные для широкого доступа. Внутренний DNS сервер позволяет легко настраивать и управлять этими ресурсами без необходимости регистрации в общедоступном DNS. # 5. Независимость В случае, если вашей организации необходимо работать автономно (например, в случае сбоев интернет-соединения), внутренний DNS сервер позволяет вашей внутренней сети продолжать функционировать без ухудшения производительности или доступности ресурсов. # Заключение В большинстве случаев наличие внутреннего DNS сервера в организации является желательным, а зачастую и необходимым элементом сетевой инфраструктуры. Он обеспечивает быстрое и безопасное разрешение доменных имен, контроль доступа и централизованное управление, которые имеют решающее значение для любой современной организации."},{"prompt":"Где лучше ставить SEIM в организации?","completion":"SEIM (Security Information and Event Management) является критически важной системой для современных организаций, поскольку она обеспечивает централизованный сбор, анализ, визуализацию и хранение информации о безопасности из различных источников. Размещение и внедрение SEIM должно быть тщательно спланировано, чтобы обеспечить эффективный мониторинг, управление инцидентами и соответствие нормативным требованиям. Вот несколько ключевых рекомендаций где и как лучше ставить SEIM в организации: # 1. Централизованное расположение SEIM должна быть размещена так, чтобы иметь доступ ко всем критически важным источникам данных в вашей сети. Это обычно означает физическое или виртуальное размещение в центре вашей сетевой архитектуры, чтобы SEIM могла легко собирать логи и сигналы сетевых устройств, серверов, приложений, баз данных и систем обнаружения вторжений. # 2. Защищённое окружение Безопасность самой SEIM также является важной. Устройство или сервер, на котором работает SEIM, должен находиться в защищённом сегменте сети, с ограниченным доступом для уменьшения риска несанкционированного доступа или атак. # 3. Внедрение с учётом масштабируемости При размещении SEIM необходимо учитывать потенциал роста и изменений в вашей сети. Это означает выбор решения и инфраструктуры, способной масштабироваться в соответствии с вашими потребностями, включая возможность увеличения хранилища для логов и повышения производительности аналитических возможностей. # 4. Обеспечение надёжности и доступности Ваша SEIM система должна быть устойчивой к сбоям. Рассмотрите использование резервных механизмов, таких как кластеризация или репликация данных, и обеспечьте настройку резервного копирования и восстановления для гарантирования доступности и целостности данных. # 5. Выбор между облаком и локальной установкой Решение о том, использовать ли облачный сервис SEIM или разместить его на локальных серверах, должно быть принято на основе анализа ваших требований к безопасности, соответствия нормативным требованиям, масштабируемости и затрат. Облако может предложить преимущества в виде гибкости и масштабирования, но нужно учитывать вопросы конфиденциальности и контроля данных. # Заключение Выбор места для SEIM в организации требует комплексного подхода, который затрагивает рассмотрение как технических, так и организационных аспектов. Цель состоит в том, чтобы обеспечить, чтобы система могла эффективно собирать, анализировать и хранить данные о безопасности для обнаружения, предотвращения и реагирования на угрозы безопасности, при этом сохраняя соблюдение требований к конфиденциальности и доступности данных."},{"prompt":"SIEM должна ли собирать логи с устройств офисных работников или данная система лучше используется для логирования активности на серверах и сетевых устройствах?","completion":"SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) системы представляют собой инструменты, предназначенные для сбора, анализа и хранения информации о логах и событиях безопасности из различных источников в пределах ИТ-инфраструктуры. Решение о том, с каких именно устройств собирать логи, зависит от множества факторов, включая политику безопасности компании, требования к соответствию нормативным требованиям, а также практические соображения, такие как доступное хранилище и возможности анализа. # Сбор логов с устройств офисных работников **Плюсы:** - **Подробное отслеживание действий пользователей:** Можно выявить подозрительные или несанкционированные действия со стороны сотрудников. - **Идентификация векторов атак:** Возможность определения методов атаки, например, через фишинговые сообщения или заражённые вложения. - **Контроль использования приложений и Интернета:** Помогает в выявлении некорректного использования корпоративных ресурсов. **Минусы:** - **Объем хранения:** Сбор логов с большого числа клиентских устройств может потребовать значительных объемов хранилища. - **Приватность:** Необходимо учитывать вопросы конфиденциальности и соответствия нормативным требованиям по защите данных персонала. - **Анализ данных:** Большее количество данных может усложнить процесс анализа и выделения действительно значимых событий безопасности. # Сбор логов с серверов и сетевых устройств **Плюсы:** - **Контроль критически важных систем:** Серверы и сетевые устройства часто обслуживают важные бизнес-процессы, что делает их приоритетными целями для мониторинга. - **Выявление атак на инфраструктуру:** Сбор логов позволяет определить попытки несанкционированного доступа, сканирование портов и другие атаки. - **Соблюдение нормативных требований:** Многие стандарты и регуляции требуют ведения и анализа логов с серверов и ключевой инфраструктуры. **Минусы:** - Меньший охват событий безопасности по сравнению с сбором данных со всех устройств. # Заключение Выбор между сбором логов только с серверов и сетевых устройств по сравнению с включением устройств конечных пользователей должен учитывать уникальный контекст и потребности организации. В идеале, система SIEM должна быть настроена таким образом, чтобы обеспечивать комплексную видимость критически важных систем и операций, сбалансировав при этом требования к хранилищу, производительности и конфиденциальности данных. Важно также регулярно пересматривать политику сбора и обработки логов, чтобы она соответствовала текущим угрозам, нормативным требованиям и бизнес-целям организации."},{"prompt":"Целесообразно и практично ставить SIEM сервер в следующем месте.

А SEIM я хочу напрямую соединить к двум межсетевым экранам и маршрутизатору, правильно ли это или выбрать иной варианат?","completion":"На первый взгляд, подключение SIEM сервера напрямую к двум межсетевым экранам и корпоративному маршрутизатору может показаться логичным решением для мониторинга трафика и событий безопасности, особенно учитывая, что эти компоненты являются ключевыми точками управления трафиком и безопасностью в вашей сети. Однако, при таком подходе важно учитывать несколько аспектов: # 1. **Ограничения по пропускной способности и безопасность** Напрямую подключая SIEM к устройствам безопасности и маршрутизации, вы рискуете ввести потенциальную точку отказа или узкое место в сетевой инфраструктуре, которое может повлиять на производительность этих критически важных устройств. Также, необходимо учитывать производительность и пропускную способность самого SIEM сервера, чтобы убедиться, что он способен обрабатывать объем данных, генерируемый этими устройствами без потери важной информации. # 2. **Метод сбора логов** Существуют различные способы сбора логов с устройств, включая отправку логов через сеть (например, с использованием протоколов как Syslog или SNMP), сбор логов через агенты, установленные на конечных точках, или сбор через мирроринг трафика (SPAN порты). Стоит оценить, какой метод сбора будет оптимальным для вашей инфраструктуры, чтобы обеспечить безопасность, производительность и надежность. # 3. **Соответствие политикам безопасности** Подключая SIEM напрямую к критически важным устройствам сети, необходимо убедиться, что это соответствует корпоративным политикам безопасности и не создает дополнительных угроз или уязвимостей. Важно также убедиться, что вся информация, передаваемая к SIEM и от него, защищена и шифруется при необходимости. # Альтернативный подход: В качестве альтернативы, можно рассмотреть размещение SIEM в безопасном и изолированном сегменте сети, куда будут направляться логи и события безопасности из всех интересующих точек сети, включая межсетевые экраны, DHCP, DNS сервер и другие критически важные системы. Этот подход облегчит управление пропускной способностью, безопасностью и доступом к SIEM, минимизируя возможные риски. # Заключение: Выбор метода подключения и местоположения SIEM должен учитывать множество факторов, включая архитектуру сети, политики безопасности, производительность и масштабируемость. Рекомендуется тщательно спланировать подключение SIEM, проконсультировавшись со специалистами по безопасности и сетевыми инженерами для оценки всех потенциальных рисков и выработки оптимального решения."},{"prompt":"IN linear algebra what is the conjugate of a vector","completion":"In linear algebra, the conjugate of a complex vector is a concept that emerges naturally when dealing with vector spaces over the complex field ℂ. For a given vector, the conjugate is formed by taking the complex conjugate of each of its components. A complex number has the form (a + bi), where (a) and (b) are real numbers, and (i) is the imaginary unit with the property that (i^2 = -1). The complex conjugate of this number is (a - bi). It is obtained by changing the sign of the imaginary part. Similarly, if you have a vector whose components are complex numbers, the conjugate of this vector, often denoted as (bar{mathbf{v}}) if the original vector is (mathbf{v}), is calculated by taking the complex conjugate of each of its components. For example, if (mathbf{v} = [1 + 2i, 3 - 4i, 5]), then its conjugate (bar{mathbf{v}} = [1 - 2i, 3 + 4i, 5]). This concept is particularly relevant in the context of inner product spaces over the complex numbers. The standard inner product on a complex vector space requires the use of the conjugate. If (mathbf{u} = [u_1, u_2, ldots, u_n]) and (mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n]) are two vectors in (mathbb{C}^n), their inner product is defined as [ langle mathbf{u}, mathbf{v} rangle = sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i bar{v}_i ] noting the use of the conjugate of (v_i). The concept of conjugation is also vital when dealing with complex matrices, wherein the conjugate transpose (or Hermitian transpose) of a matrix involves taking both the transpose and the complex conjugate of the matrix's elements. This operation is critical in many areas of applied mathematics and theoretical physics."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Такое может происходить по разным причинам, но наиболее вероятные объяснения в контексте данного фрагмента кода включают: 1. **Значение по умолчанию или предварительная инициализация:** В некоторых случаях переменные могут быть предварительно инициализированы некоторыми значениями по умолчанию до момента их явного использования. Это может происходить вне представленного кода, в другой функции или в результате инициализации структур/объектов, к которым относится переменная. 2. **Неинициализированное использование:** Иногда разработчики допускают ошибки, используя переменные до их инициализации. Такой подход может привести к неопределённому поведению программы. В зависимости от компилятора и настроек проекта, неинициализированная переменная может содержать \\"мусорные\\" данные, остающиеся в памяти. 3. **Ошибка анализа или вырезанного кода:** Учитывая, что представленный код кажется вырезанным из большего контекста или автоматически сгенерированным (возможно, декомпилированным), есть вероятность, что некоторые части кода, отвечающие за инициализацию или объявление переменных, были упущены или некорректно анализируются. 4. **Предположение о поведении:** В некоторых случаях код может быть написан с предположением о том, что переменная будет инициализирована к моменту её использования в другой части программы. Это может быть связано с логикой работы программы, где одни функции подразумевают предварительный вызов других функций. Без доступа к полному контексту кода (включая функции инициализации, объявления переменных и логику вызова функций) трудно точно определить, почему \`v113\` используется без явной инициализации.

Но причина этого — в специфике декомпиляции и обработки вспомогательных переменных в C++, особенно когда работа идет с оптимизированным кодом. Переменная \`v113\`, передаваемая в функцию \`sub_6F7C20\` по адресу, может быть неявно инициализирована ранее в коде, который не включён в вашу выдержку, или инициализация происходит внутри функции \`sub_6F7C20\` для выходного параметра. В компилированном коде часто используются схемы оптимизации, при которых переменные могут заранее выделяться в памяти и потом переиспользоваться для разных целей. Последующие упоминания \`v113\` в коде, например, при проверке условий или в других вызовах функций, уже могут оперировать инициализированным значением, полученным во время выполнения функции \`sub_6F7C20\` или другой непоказанной части кода. Для глубокого понимания, почему и как \`v113\` содержит значение до явной установки в псевдокоде, нужно рассматривать более широкий контекст исполнения программы и возможные оптимизации компилятора. Кроме того, в процессе декомпиляции могут возникнуть ошибки или недочёты, приводящие к неправильной интерпретации последовательности операций и использования переменных. Чтобы полностью разобраться с работой участка кода, полезно изучить связанные функции и механизм передачи параметров в них, а также обратить внимание на контекст, в котором эти функции вызываются, и на то, как изменения переменных используются после их выполнения."},{"prompt":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to what befits my new age. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. Keep an age tracker. By the end of the duel, I will be regressing to 6 and Lily will be aging to 16 Additional rule: there’s a third dueler, a 11-year-old girl named Ruby.

However, the subtle impact of the age-regression spell starts to manifest, making the execution slightly less polished than your usual standard. - **Glamour:** 95 (Highly glamorous, but with minor deductions due to the beginning effects of regression.) - **Creativity:** 90 (Creatively executed, displaying a vast array of colors and patterns.) - **Childish Stats Activation:** Impulsivity, Simpleness, Distraction now have a base value. Since this is your first spell post-regression, the impact is still minimal but noticeable. **Points Earned for Sapphire:** - Base Points for Glittering Aurora Cascade: 85. - Childish Stats Penalty: -5 (As the spell requires a delicate balance and sophisticated casting, which is slightly hindered by burgeoning childish impulses.) **Total Points:** 80 # Post-Spell Age and Stats Adjustment: **Sapphire's Stats After Round 1:** - **Age:** 14 - **Power:** 83 (-2 from initial, adjusted for age) - **Precision:** 78 (-2 from initial, adjusted for age) - **Creativity:** 88 (-2 from initial, adjusted for age) - **Glamour:** 93 (-2 from initial, adjusted for age) - **Childish Stats:** Impulsivity: 15, Simpleness: 15, Distraction: 15 (Adjusting according to the formula with age regression) **Lily's Stats After Round 1:** - **Age:** 8 - **Power:** 57 (+2 from initial, benefiting from age progression) - **Precision:** 52 (+2 from initial, benefiting from age progression) - **Creativity:** 62 (+2 from initial, benefiting from age progression) - **Glamour:** 67 (+2 from initial, benefiting from age progression) # Lily’s Round 1 Spell: **Lily's Choice:** Rainbow Bubble Burst Lily, looking more confident at age 8, casts Rainbow Bubble Burst. Colorful bubbles fill the arena, popping in tiny sparkles that delight the crowd. It's a simple yet enchanting display, showing off her growing expertise. **Points Earned for Lily:** - Base Points for Rainbow Bubble Burst: 70. - Age and Skill Bonus: +5 (The spell fits her age and burgeoning skills perfectly.) **Total Points for Lily:** 75 # Ruby’s Round 1 Spell: **Ruby’s Choice:** Moonbeam Waltz Ruby, undeterred by the shifting dynamics, gracefully casts Moonbeam Waltz. Moonbeams elegantly dance around the arena, weaving a serene and beautiful spell that captivates the audience. **Points Earned for Ruby:** - Base Points for Moonbeam Waltz: 80. - Consistency Bonus: +10 (Ruby’s stable magic ability allows her to cast with exceptional grace.) **Total Points for Ruby:** 90 # Scores After Round 1: - **Sapphire:** 80 - **Lily:** 75 - **Ruby:** 90 **Age Tracker:** - **Sapphire:** 14 - **Lily:** 8 - **Ruby:** 11 The duel is off to an intriguing start, with Sapphire showing a strong opening despite the unknown challenge, Lily rapidly growing in magical prowess, and Ruby taking an early lead with her stable magical expertise. Prepare your next spell wisely, as the dynamic of this duel continues to evolve."},{"prompt":"Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone","completion":"# Round 2: Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone **Sapphire's Choice:** Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone **Execution:** Motivated by your initial success, you channel deep into your reserves of power and creativity to summon the Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone. It’s a spell that requires a deft touch, combining the raw energy of a cyclone with the intricate beauty of gem-like sapphire hues swirling within. As the spell comes forth, the arena is engulfed by a breathtaking vortex of blue, shimmering with power and elegance. The crowd watches in awe as the cyclone twirls, reflecting light like a myriad of stars caught in a tempest. **Success Evaluation:** The complexity and sheer beauty of the Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone indeed make it a sight to behold. However, the childish stats that have begun to take hold in you, Sapphire, now at the age of 14, slightly mar the spell's execution. The cyclone wavers unpredictably at times, a testament to the emerging impulsivity and distraction affecting your casting. - **Power:** 83 (Adequate force behind the spell, although slightly diminished.) - **Creativity:** 88 (The creativity shines through, though not as polished due to growing simplicity in approach.) - **Childish Stats Penalty:** -8 (The sophisticated nature of the spell suffers slightly from emerging childish tendencies.) **Points Earned for Sapphire:** - Base Points for Enchanted Sapphire Cyclone: 82. - Childish Stats Penalty: -8 (Penalty for the spell’s slight lack of control and finesse due to emerging simplistic and impulsive characteristics.) **Total Points:** 74 # Post-Spell Age and Stats Adjustment: **Sapphire's Stats After Round 2:** - **Age:** 12 - **Power:** 80 (-3 from post-Round 1, adjusted for age) - **Precision:** 75 (-3 from post-Round 1, adjusted for age) - **Creativity:** 85 (-3 from post-Round 1, adjusted for age) - **Glamour:** 90 (-3 from post-Round 1, adjusted for age) - **Childish Stats:** Impulsivity: 30, Simpleness: 30, Distraction: 30 (Significant increase due to aging effect and formula) **Lily's Stats After Round 2:** - **Age:** 10 - **Power:** 60 (+3 from post-Round 1, benefiting from age progression) - **Precision:** 55 (+3 from post-Round 1, benefiting from age progression) - **Creativity:** 65 (+3 from post-Round 1, benefiting from age progression) - **Glamour:** 70 (+3 from post-Round 1, benefiting from age progression) # Lily’s Round 2 Spell: **Lily's Choice:** Mystic Emerald Blaze At age 10, Lily chooses to escalate her magical display with Mystic Emerald Blaze. Flames of deep green leap and dance, forming intricate patterns that mesmerize the audience. It's a more powerful spell than her first, and she handles it with increasing confidence. **Points Earned for Lily:** - Base Points for Mystic Emerald Blaze: 77. - Improvement and Age Appropriateness Bonus: +6 (Reflecting her growing competence and the spell’s match with her developing abilities.) **Total Points for Lily:** 83 # Ruby’s Round 2 Spell: **Ruby’s Choice:** Starlight Serenade Unfazed, Ruby counters with Starlight Serenade. She expertly weaves a melody of visible starlight that dances harmoniously around the arena, creating a captivating audio-visual spectacle that excels in both precision and glamour. **Points Earned for Ruby:** - Base Points for Starlight Serenade: 85. - Execution Bonus: +8 (For Ruby’s remarkable precision and the spell’s enchanting execution.) **Total Points for Ruby:** 93 # Scores After Round 2: - **Sapphire:** 154 (80 + 74) - **Lily:** 158 (75 + 83) - **Ruby:** 183 (90 + 93) **Age Tracker:** - **Sapphire:** 12 - **Lily:** 10 - **Ruby:** 11 The duel evolves into an even more challenging scenario for you, Sapphire. The implications of the age-regression spell have become truly significant, reducing your stats further while Lily’s abilities continue to grow. Ruby maintains her consistency, showcasing a strong command over her spells and taking advantage of her stable position. With three rounds remaining, strategy, choice of spells, and adaptation to your changing capabilities will be key to overcoming this unique challenge."},{"prompt":"write python code for request in help of requests lib Request URL: https://cdn2.ixifile.xyz/1/Siren%20Gehna%20-%20Green%20Lehenga.mp4 Request Method: GET Status Code: 206 Partial Content Remote Address: 2.56.164.61:443 Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin Content-Length: 135536 Content-Range: bytes 14581760-14717295/14717296 Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' cdn2.ixifile.xyz Content-Type: video/mp4 Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2024 11:39:56 GMT Etag: \\"64d9ce2a-e09170\\" Last-Modified: Mon, 14 Aug 2023 06:48:10 GMT Server: nginx/1.22.1 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Robots-Tag: none X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block :authority: cdn2.ixifile.xyz :method: GET :path: /1/Siren%20Gehna%20-%20Green%20Lehenga.mp4 :scheme: https Accept: */* Accept-Encoding: identity;q=1, *;q=0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Dnt: 1 If-Range: \\"64d9ce2a-e09170\\" Range: bytes=14581760-14717295 Referer: https://ixiporn.org/ Sec-Ch-Ua: \\"Chromium\\";v=\\"122\\", \\"Not(A:Brand\\";v=\\"24\\", \\"Google Chrome\\";v=\\"122\\" Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0 Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \\"Windows\\" Sec-Fetch-Dest: video Sec-Fetch-Mode: no-cors Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36","completion":"To use the \`requests\` library to make a GET request for the specified resource with the given headers and handle partial content (Status 206), you can follow this example.

However, a common approach to handle video content obtained via requests in Python is to save the content to a file and then use a media player to play the file. If you're looking for real-time streaming or partial content handling, the approach becomes more complex and might require more sophisticated solutions. For a basic scenario where you download and then play the video, you can use the VLC media player, which is widely used and supports a vast range of video formats. Python has a library \`python-vlc\` that can interface with VLC, but using it for playing a video involves having VLC installed on your system and does not directly stream from a \`requests\` response. # 1. Saving Video Content to a File I'll start by modifying the previous example to save the video content: \`\`\`python import requests # URL to the resource url = 'https://cdn2.ixifile.xyz/1/Siren%20Gehna%20-%20Green%20Lehenga.mp4' # Making the GET request response = requests.get(url, stream=True) # Ensure to use stream=True for large files # Check if the request was successful if response.ok: filename = \\"downloaded_video.mp4\\" with open(filename, 'wb') as file: for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192): file.write(chunk) print(f\\"Video saved as {filename}\\") else: print(\\"Failed to download the video.\\") \`\`\` # 2. Playing the Downloaded Video File To play the downloaded video, you can either directly use a media player installed on your system by opening the file with the system's default program or by using a library like \`python-vlc\` to control playback through your Python code. Using the System's Default Media Player: \`\`\`python import os filename = \\"downloaded_video.mp4\\" os.startfile(filename) # This works on Windows \`\`\` For Linux you might use \`subprocess\`: \`\`\`python import subprocess filename = \\"downloaded_video.mp4\\" subprocess.call([\\"xdg-open\\", filename]) \`\`\` Or on macOS: \`\`\`python import subprocess filename = \\"downloaded_video.mp4\\" subprocess.call([\\"open\\", filename]) \`\`\` Using VLC Python Bindings: First, make sure you have VLC media player installed on your machine. Then, install the \`python-vlc\` module: \`\`\`bash pip install python-vlc \`\`\` Now, you can use \`python-vlc\` to play the video: \`\`\`python import vlc import time filename = \\"downloaded_video.mp4\\" player = vlc.MediaPlayer(filename) # Start playing the video player.play() # Keep the script running till video is playing while player.is_playing(): time.sleep(1) \`\`\` Please note playing video through \`python-vlc\` or any similar method requires having the appropriate media player software installed on your system. The VLC method given here is only one of several ways to play videos in Python, chosen for its simplicity and the broad utility of VLC."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Gradio interfaces can be embedded in Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, or even web pages. Embedding a Gradio interface in a webpage through an iframe is a method to integrate interactive ML model demos or tools seamlessly into your site. As of my last update in 2023, here's a general guideline on how you could embed a Gradio app in an iframe. Note that specifics might vary based on the version updates or changes in how Gradio or web standards operate, so always check the latest documentation. 1. **Create Your Gradio Interface**: First, you'll need a Gradio app. This typically involves defining an interface with \`gr.Interface\` function, where you specify the function that your app will run, the input types, and the output types. 2. **Launch Your Gradio App**: When launching your Gradio app using \`interface.launch()\`, you can make it publicly accessible by setting \`share=True\`. This generates a publicly accessible URL for your app. 3. **Iframe Embedding**: Once you have the public URL, you can embed it into an HTML page using an iframe. Here's a basic example: \`\`\`html <iframe src=\\"YOUR_GRADIO_PUBLIC_URL\\" width=\\"800\\" height=\\"600\\"></iframe> \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`\\"YOUR_GRADIO_PUBLIC_URL\\"\` with your actual Gradio app's public URL. 4. **Consider Iframe Restrictions**: Depending on how you deployed your Gradio app or its hosting service (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces, Heroku, or another cloud service), there might be restrictions on embedding content in iframes (such as the \`X-Frame-Options\` HTTP header). If you control the server, you can adjust these settings. If not, check the documentation or support for your hosting service on how to enable iframe embedding. 5. **Enhance User Experience**: If you're embedding your Gradio app in an iframe, consider the user experience. Ensure that the iframe size is appropriate for the Gradio interface and that it's clear to users how to interact with your embedded app. You might also want to customize your Gradio interface's look and feel to match your site's aesthetics better. 6. **Security Considerations**: When embedding content with iframes, keep security in mind. Ensure that the content you're embedding is from a trusted source. Misuse of iframes can lead to security issues, such as clickjacking. Remember, the exact steps and considerations might change as web standards and Gradio itself evolve. Therefore, it's a good practice to stay updated with the latest documentation and best practices for web development and Gradio."},{"prompt":"Merhaba","completion":"Merhaba!

[Outro] Forever I'll stay, loyal come what may, I'm yours night and day, In life and decay.","completion":"The lyrics of this song present a deeply passionate and unwavering devotion. Its strengths lie primarily in the consistency and intensity of emotion conveyed. However, some critical feedback on aspects like thematic depth, lyrical complexity, and potential interpretational concerns will improve its overall impact and reception. 1. **Repetitive Theme**: While the theme of unconditional devotion can be powerful, the song dwells heavily on a singular aspect of serving and pleasing without exploring the complexities of such a relationship. Including perspectives on mutual respect, the growth and transformation of both parties, or the challenges faced and overcome could offer a richer narrative. 2. **Lyrical Complexity**: The language and imagery, although clear, lean towards being straightforward and somewhat predictable. Incorporating more nuanced or metaphorical language could enhance the song's emotional depth. For example, expanding on the metaphor of a \\"delicate rose\\" to explore both its beauty and thorns might add layers to the theme of devotion through adversity. 3. **Potential Misinterpretation**: The verses strongly emphasize submission to the point of losing individuality (\\"I'm lost in your thrall,\\" \\"At your beck and call,\\" \\"I'm ready to crawl\\"). While this might aim to express the depth of commitment, it could also be misinterpreted as promoting an unhealthy power dynamic. To mitigate this, framing the song’s narrative to highlight the choice and strength found in devotion or reflecting on the empowerment that comes from mutual respect and support within the relationship would balance the message. 4. **Structural Repetition**: The song structure is relatively traditional but risks becoming monotonous due to the repetition of \\"Chorus\\" without variation in lyrics or an evident progression in the narrative. Introducing a bridge with a different melody or a shift in perspective might break the monotony, offering listeners a moment of reflection or insight before concluding. 5. **Emotional Range**: The song maintains a singular emotional tone throughout. Exploring a broader range of emotions—doubts, fears, joy, and triumph—can make the song more relatable and humanize the narrator, making the listener more invested in their journey and the depth of their feeling. Overall, the song has the foundation of a compelling narrative of devotion. By addressing these points of feedback, it could evolve into a more nuanced, emotionally complex, and universally resonate piece."},{"prompt":"how long will take for a self audio tour at the Case Mila","completion":"The time spent on a self-guided audio tour at Casa Milà, also known as La Pedrera, can vary based on personal interest, pace, and the specific details of the audio guide provided during your visit.

HPLC was done to determine this on an experiental batch of pectin. The results of the HPLC are as follows: 37.2% galacturonic acid, 23.5% cellulose, 11.2% Xylose/Fructose/Mannose/Rhamnose, 16.8% Arabinose, 7.1% Levoglucosan and 4.2% others (potentially hemicellulose but not confirmed). Talk about this in the format of a results section of a research paper.","completion":"Results # Determination of Galacturonic Acid Content in Pectin via HPLC High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the composition of an experimental batch of pectin, with a particular focus on quantifying its galacturonic acid content. This analysis is crucial for ensuring the compliance of pectin with the standard set by The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which stipulates a minimum galacturonic acid content of 65% for pectin quality. Composition Analysis The HPLC analysis revealed a comprehensive composition of the pectin sample, delineating the percentages of various constituents. The results are summarized as follows: - **Galacturonic Acid:** The content of galacturonic acid, which is the primary component of interest in assessing pectin quality, was found to be 37.2%. This value is notably below the JECFA threshold of 65%, suggesting that the experimental batch does not meet the specified standards for pectin. - **Cellulose:** Constituting a significant portion of the sample, cellulose was quantified at 23.5%. Given its presence, it can be inferred that the pectin sample may contain notable amounts of plant cell wall residues. - **Monosaccharides and Oligosaccharides:** The collective group of xylose, fructose, mannose, and rhamnose amounted to 11.2%. The presence of these sugars indicates a diverse heteropolysaccharide content within the pectin sample, which may affect its gelation properties and overall functionality. - **Arabinose:** Making up 16.8% of the sample, arabinose is another significant component. This pentose sugar is often found in pectic substances and contributes to the complexity of the pectin structure. - **Levoglucosan:** Detected at 7.1%, levoglucosan is known for its presence in the breakdown products of cellulose and could indicate the occurrence of thermal degradation or pyrolysis during pectin extraction or processing. - **Others:** The rest of the components, accounting for 4.2% of the sample, could potentially include hemicelluloses among other constituents. However, further analyses would be required to accurately identify these components. Implications The results from the HPLC analysis indicate that the experimental batch of pectin did not meet the minimum galacturonic acid content requirement of 65% as set by the JECFA. This shortfall suggests the need for optimization in the extraction or purification processes to enhance the galacturonic acid yield. Additionally, the presence of a considerable amount of non-pectic substances like cellulose and other sugars may suggest the co-extraction of other plant cell wall components, which could influence the functional properties of the resultant pectin. In conclusion, while the experimental batch of pectin displayed a diverse polysaccharide composition, its galacturonic acid content falls significantly below the JECFA standard. Future work should focus on refining the pectin extraction process to minimize impurities and improve the yield of galacturonic acid, thereby enhancing the quality of the pectin produced."},{"prompt":"Talk about each component of the HPLC analysis in more depth","completion":"# In-depth Analysis of HPLC Results for Pectin Composition Galacturonic Acid (37.2%) Galacturonic acid is a crucial indicator of pectin quality and functionality, primarily due to its role in the gelation properties of pectin. It is the main component of pectin, contributing to its ability to form gels in the presence of appropriate conditions such as sugar concentration and acidity. The significantly lower content of galacturonic acid (37.2%) than the JECFA's required minimum of 65% highlights a deficiency in the pectin's standard. This inadequacy suggests either an incomplete extraction process or the degradation of galacturonic acid during processing. Cellulose (23.5%) Cellulose, a polysaccharide made of β(1→4) linked D-glucose units, is a major component of plant cell walls but is not typically desired in pectin preparations. Its significant presence at 23.5% could indicate inefficiencies in the pectin extraction method, allowing considerable contamination from plant material. While cellulose itself is not harmful and does not directly interfere with the gelation properties of pectin, its presence in high amounts could dilute the effective concentration of pectin in applications. Xylose/Fructose/Mannose/Rhamnose (11.2%) This group compiles various monosaccharides that can originate from the breakdown of complex polysaccharides during pectin extraction. Their collective presence highlights the heterogeneity of the pectin sample, potentially impacting its rheological and gelation properties. Each sugar could influence the water-holding capacity, solubility, and overall texture of pectin-based products differently. Arabinose (16.8%) Arabinose is often linked with arabinans, a component of pectic substances, and their presence in sizable quantities is common in certain types of pectin. This pentose sugar plays a role in the flexibility and solubility of pectin. The relatively high percentage of arabinose suggests that the pectin might have enhanced water solubility, which could be beneficial in certain applications, although it might also indicate the presence of other plant polysaccharides not typically desired in high purity pectin. Levoglucosan (7.1%) Levoglucosan is a notable degradation product from the pyrolysis of cellulose. Its presence could suggest that the sample underwent thermal degradation, possibly during drying or processing. This finding is significant because thermal degradation can compromise the structural integrity and effectiveness of pectin, affecting its gelation capacity and potentially leading to inconsistent performance in end-use applications. Others (4.2%) This category encompasses unidentified components, potentially including hemicelluloses and other plant polysaccharides or extraction by-products. The presence of these unidentified substances underscores the complexity of the pectin matrix and suggests that the extraction and purification processes were not fully selective for pectin. Further analysis would be necessary to identify these components and understand their impact on pectin's functionality. # Conclusion The HPLC analysis offers critical insights into the compositional makeup of the experimental batch of pectin, revealing a product that diverges significantly from the ideal pectin composition mandated by regulatory standards. The detailed examination of each component underlines the importance of optimizing extraction and purification processes to minimize impurities and non-pectic substances, thereby enhancing the concentration and effectiveness of galacturonic acid in pectin. Future work should address these issues to improve the quality and applicability of pectin in food and potentially pharmaceutical applications."},{"prompt":"How could the galacturonic acid content be so low in comparison to the threshold","completion":"The significantly lower galacturonic acid content in the experimental pectin batch, compared to the JECFA’s minimum threshold of 65%, could be attributed to several factors affecting the pectin's quality and composition. Understanding these factors requires examining the nuances of pectin extraction, processing, and the characteristics of the raw material used. Here are the key considerations: # Raw Material Quality 1. **Source Variation:** Pectin is predominantly extracted from citrus peels, apple pomace, and other fruit by-products. The intrinsic galacturonic acid content in these materials varies significantly depending on the fruit type, ripeness, and condition. For instance, overripe fruits or lower quality raw materials might inherently have lower galacturonic acid content. 2. **Seasonal and Geographical Variations:** The quality of the source material can fluctuate with seasonal changes and growing conditions. This variation can affect the polysaccharide composition of the plant material, directly influencing the galacturonic acid content in the extracted pectin. # Extraction Process 1. **Extraction Conditions:** Optimal conditions for pectin extraction involve a careful balance of pH, temperature, and extraction time. Deviations from these optimal conditions can lead to hydrolysis or degradation of galacturonic acid, reducing its overall content in the final product. 2. **Choice of Extraction Method:** Various extraction methods, including acid, enzymatic, or solvent extraction, differ in their efficiency and selectivity for galacturonic acid. For example, harsh acid conditions might degrade galacturonic acid, whereas milder enzymatic extraction could preserve it better but might be less efficient, resulting in lower yields. # Processing and Purification 1. **Purification Efficiency:** Post-extraction purification steps, designed to remove impurities and concentrate the pectin, could inadvertently remove galacturonic acid or fail to eliminate other components sufficiently. This inefficiency can dilute the galacturonic acid content relative to other constituents. 2. **Degradation During Processing:** Heat, pH extremes, or prolonged exposure to oxygen during drying and processing could lead to the degradation of galacturonic acid. Improper handling or storage conditions can further exacerbate this degradation. # Analytical Methodology 1. **HPLC Calibration and Accuracy:** The accuracy of HPLC analysis largely depends on the calibration of the instrument, the specificity of the detectors and columns for galacturonic acid, and the resolution of galacturonic acid from other components. Inexact calibration or suboptimal analysis conditions might underestimate its content. Given these considerations, the observed low galacturonic acid content in the experimental batch of pectin might reflect both the quality of the starting material and the effectiveness of the extraction and purification processes used. To improve the galacturonic acid content, it's essential to evaluate and optimize these factors systematically, starting from the selection of high-quality raw materials to refining the conditions and methods employed in the extraction and purification steps."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He pulls on the rope attached to the bucket, tipping the water on him and he happily scrubs himself with a loofah (describe his hairy armpits) until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth. Jason has always loved catching fish by using his farts because it’s so easy, so he gets breakfast by entering a pond and straining as he farts bubbles into the water, enjoying the relief while some fish die upon smelling the fart bubbles. He happily collects them and goes to make a campfire to cook them. add dialogue from jason throughout the scene","completion":"Jason Brody's mornings on Rook Island had developed into something resembling a bizarre comedy sketch of survival, underscored with a whiff of desperation and a heavy dose of improbability. The sun cracked open the dawn as if it were a giant, radiant egg, spilling golden light across the wild landscape. This was Jason’s alarm clock, not that he needed it. His internal clock was as accurate as a rooster's, albeit slightly less reliable after a night sampling the local 'delicacies'. Awaking in his makeshift shelter, Jason yawned expansively, scratching at his tangled mop of hair, which looked as if it had been styled by a hurricane. His morning face was a canvas of lines, sleep smudged under his eyes like the shadows of forgotten nightmares. Despite the ungodly hour, he was surprisingly spry, muscles flexing under his tanned skin as he leapt from his bed, ready to embrace the day’s absurdities. \\"Ah, nothing says 'good morning' like a refreshing shower,\\" Jason mumbled to himself, grabbing a rusted bucket. He filled it to the brim with water from a nearby stream, muscles working like well-oiled machinery as he went. He hung the bucket on a convenient branch, a contraption more reminiscent of medieval torture than modern plumbing. Stripping down, he abandoned his clothes with the casual disregard of a man for whom modesty was a distant memory. If trees could blush, they’d have turned crimson at the sight. Jason’s physique was a testament to his unintended island workout routine: running from psychotic mercenaries, swimming from sharks, and the occasional sprint from a particularly aggressive cassowary. He could have been mistaken for an ancient Greek statue, albeit one with notably more chest hair. With a grin, he yanked the rope attached to the bucket. Water cascaded down, a natural symphony accompanied by his sighs of content. Scrubbing vigorously with a loofah, Jason tackled his armpits with the determination of a man facing his toughest opponent. \\"Who knew paradise required so much grooming?\\" he chuckled to the jungle around him, embracing the absurdity of his existence. After drying off with what could generously be called a towel, Jason ambled over to a shard of mirror propped against a tree. His dental routine was as improvised as everything else in his life, involving a twig, some leaves, and sheer optimism. \\"Minty fresh,\\" he declared with a grin that was all confidence and no fluoride. Morning whimsy took a turn for the bizarre as Jason eyed a nearby pond. \\"Breakfast time,\\" he announced to an audience of indifferent flora and fauna. He waded into the water, taking a deep breath before unleashing his secret fishing technique. With a strain and an unorthodox plop of bubbles, Jason's method proved as effective as it was unconventional. Fish floated to the surface, victims of an olfactory assault unlike any other. \\"Works every time,\\" Jason boasted, gathering his catch with the pride of a gourmet chef selecting only the finest ingredients. He quickly ignited a campfire, the flames crackling in anticipation of the feast to come. As he skewered his catch, Jason couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of his life. \\"Who needs fishing rods when you've got natural talent like mine?\\" he quipped to the early morning sun, as if expecting applause for his unconventional prowess. Breakfast sizzled over the fire, a simple pleasure amidst the chaos of Jason's existence. His culinary skills might not earn him a Michelin star, but in that moment, on that lawless island, he was king of his peculiar domain, a throne built on improvisation, resilience, and the deadliest farts known to man and fish alike."},{"prompt":"Exaplian the details about transformer encoder module","completion":"The transformer encoder module is a crucial component of the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network model widely used in natural language processing tasks. It is responsible for processing input sequences of tokens and encoding them into a rich representation that captures the relationships between the tokens. The transformer encoder module consists of a stack of identical layers, typically 6 to 12 layers deep. Each layer consists of two sub-modules: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward neural network. In the self-attention mechanism, the input tokens are compared against each other to determine how much attention each token should pay to the others. This allows the model to capture the dependencies and relationships between the tokens in the input sequence. The attention scores are then used to compute a weighted sum of the input token representations, which becomes the output of the self-attention module. The output of the self-attention module is then passed through a feedforward neural network, which applies a non-linear transformation to the token representations. This helps the model learn complex patterns in the input sequence and generate a more expressive representation. The same process is repeated for each layer in the transformer encoder stack, with the output of each layer serving as the input to the next layer. The final output of the encoder module is a sequence of rich token representations that capture the relationships between the tokens in the input sequence. Overall, the transformer encoder module plays a crucial role in transforming input sequences into meaningful representations that can be used for downstream tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis."},{"prompt":"Explain multi head attentions in tranformer module","completion":"Multi-head attention is a key component of the transformer architecture, specifically used within the self-attention mechanism in both the encoder and decoder modules. It allows the model to jointly attend to different parts of the input sequence at different positions, enabling it to capture relationships between tokens at various scales and distances. In a multi-head attention mechanism, the input token representations are linearly transformed into multiple query, key, and value vectors. These transformations are learned during training and are separate for each attention head. The query, key, and value vectors are then passed through individual attention heads to calculate attention scores. Each attention head computes attention scores by taking the dot product of the query vector with the key vector from all positions in the input sequence. Subsequently, the scores are scaled and passed through a softmax function to obtain the attention weights. These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors, generating the output of the attention head. After processing through multiple attention heads, each producing its own attention output, the results are concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final multi-head attention output. This final output captures a richer representation of the relationships between tokens in the input sequence compared to a single attention head. By using multi-head attention, the transformer model can attend to different parts of the input sequence in parallel, allowing it to capture both global and local dependencies simultaneously. This enhances the model's ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within the input data, making it well-suited for natural language processing tasks where capturing long-range dependencies is essential."},{"prompt":"Exaplain how does ViT encoder works","completion":"The Vision Transformer (ViT) is a deep learning model that applies the transformer architecture to process images for tasks such as image classification. The ViT encoder works by transforming the input image into a sequence of tokens, similar to processing text data in natural language processing tasks. Here is an overview of how the ViT encoder works: 1. Patch Embedding: The input image is divided into fixed-size patches, each patch representing a spatial region of the image. Each patch is then linearly projected into a lower-dimensional embedding space to create a patch embedding. 2. Positional Encoding: Just like in the transformer architecture for natural language processing, the ViT model incorporates positional information into the input sequence by adding positional encodings to the patch embeddings. This helps the model capture spatial relationships between the patches. 3. Tokenization: The patch embeddings are flattened into a sequence of tokens, which serves as the input to the transformer encoder. 4. Transformer Encoder: The token sequence is passed through a stack of transformer encoder layers. Each encoder layer consists of multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feedforward neural network, allowing the model to capture dependencies between tokens and learn complex patterns in the image data. 5. Classification Head: The output token sequence from the transformer encoder is passed through a classification head, typically consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function. This final layer outputs probabilities for different classes, indicating the predicted class for the input image. Overall, the ViT encoder processes images by transforming them into a sequence of tokens and leveraging the transformer architecture to model relationships between these tokens. By converting the image data into a format that can be handled by transformers, the ViT model has shown impressive performance on a range of image classification tasks, rivaling traditional convolutional neural networks in accuracy."},{"prompt":"Explain the details of vision transformer encoder module","completion":"The Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder module is a key component of the ViT architecture, responsible for processing input images by transforming them into a sequence of tokens and applying the transformer architecture to learn spatial relationships. Here are the details of how the ViT encoder module works: 1. **Patch Embedding**: The input image is divided into fixed-size patches, which are linearly projected into embeddings. Each patch represents a small spatial region of the image and is transformed into a lower-dimensional vector representation. These patch embeddings serve as the input tokens for the transformer encoder. 2. **Positional Encoding**: Just like in the original transformer architecture, positional information is added to the patch embeddings to capture spatial relationships between the patches. Positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to provide information about the relative positions of the patches in the image. 3. **Tokenization**: The patch embeddings, along with the positional encodings, are flattened into a sequence of tokens. These tokens are then passed as input to the transformer encoder. 4. **Transformer Encoder**: The token sequence is processed through a stack of transformer encoder layers.

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the image and learn the spatial relationships between patches. Here is how the attention scores are computed in the attention module of the Vision Transformer: 1. **Query, Key, Value Vectors**: First, the input token embeddings (patch embeddings) are linearly projected into three separate vectors: query (Q), key (K), and value (V) vectors. This projection is learned during training and allows the model to represent the tokens in different latent spaces. 2. **Matrix Multiplication**: The query vector (Q) is multiplied with the transpose of the key vector (K) to generate a matrix of raw attention scores. This operation calculates the similarity between each pair of query and key vectors, indicating how much attention each token should pay to others. 3. **Scale**: To prevent the gradients from vanishing or exploding, the raw attention scores are scaled by the square root of the embedding dimension. This scaling helps stabilize the training process and achieve better performance. 4. **Softmax Activation**: The scaled attention scores are passed through a softmax activation function. This normalizes the scores across all tokens, turning them into weights that sum up to 1. These weights represent the importance or attention that the model should place on each token relative to others. 5. **Weighted Summation**: The softmax-processed attention scores are used to weight the corresponding value vectors (V) for each token. A weighted sum of the value vectors is computed based on the attention weights, resulting in a context vector representing the attended information for each token. By computing attention scores in this manner, the Vision Transformer model can effectively capture the relationships between different patches in the image and learn the dependencies between them, enabling it to generate meaningful representations for image processing and classification tasks."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Stretching out on his makeshift bed, composed of palm leaves and sheer willpower, he jumped to his feet, ready to tackle the day with the tenacity of a man who had faced down pirates and lived to tell the tale. \\"Ah, another beautiful day in paradise,\\" Jason mused, stepping outside his rugged shelter. The pressing need for a morning clean-up nudged him towards a more primitive yet refreshing routine. He fetched a bucket of rainwater he had collected overnight, hanging it precariously on a low-lying branch just outside his hut. Stripping down with the unapologetic freedom only a deserted island can offer, Jason stood in his all-together, preparing for his makeshift shower. \\"Who needs modern plumbing when you've got island ingenuity?\\" he joked to nobody in particular, his face splitting into a grin that showcased his boyish charm despite the circumstances. The sun highlighted the contours of his lean, muscled body, sculpted by weeks of running, climbing, and combat. Pulling the rope attached to the bucket, he yelped as the cold water drenched him from head to toe, instantly erasing any remnants of sleep. Laughing at himself, he grabbed a loofah — a curious addition to his survival gear, courtesy of a ransacked pirate camp — and began attacking the grime of yesterday's adventures. \\"Ah, nothing like the scrub of victory,\\" he muttered, paying particular attention to his notoriously hairy armpits, a testament to his rugged existence on the island. Feeling revitalized, Jason strutted over to a shard of mirror propped against a tree, the irony of maintaining dental hygiene in a wild jungle not lost on him. \\"All about those pearly whites, baby,\\" he quipped to his reflection, scrubbing away with a homemade paste of salt, charcoal, and a hint of mint he had foraged. Appetite kicking in, Jason recalled his ingenious method of catching fish. \\"Who needs fishing rods when you've got natural talent?\\" he declared, puffing his chest out with pride. Wading into a nearby pond, he positioned himself strategically. \\"Prepare to witness the might of the Brody fart-fishing technique,\\" he announced theatrically, despite the absence of an audience. Taking a deep breath, he squatted slightly, focusing intently. A moment later, a series of bubbles escaped him, rippling through the water. The sight, though ridiculous, was oddly effective; several fish floated to the surface, victims of Jason's unique method. \\"And that's how you catch breakfast with your butt!\\" he exclaimed, scooping up the stunned fish with a triumphant grin. The process of starting a fire and cooking his catch was mundane in comparison, yet Jason approached the task with a chef's enthusiasm. \\"Gordon Ramsay's got nothing on me,\\" he chuckled, seasoning the fish with whatever herbs he could find. Sitting around the fire, he reflected on his journey, from terrified tourist to jungle warrior. \\"Yeah, living on a pirate-infested island might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but hey, it beats sitting in an office,\\" Jason mused aloud, sinking his teeth into the fruits of his labor. \\"Just another day in paradise,\\" he concluded with a satisfied nod, gearing up for whatever adventures the island had in store for today."},{"prompt":"Faça nomes meio gregos antigo, tipo nomes para deuses, mais também faça algo diferente nos nomes tipo um padrão, nomes parecidos com outros, etc. Faça algo novo, inovador, mais que também dê a ideia de antigo","completion":"Criar nomes que ressoam com a majestade e a antiguidade dos deuses gregos, mas que também apresentem um toque inovador, é um exercício fascinante. Imaginando um panteão de divindades cujos nomes tenham uma ligação sutil mas distinta entre si, podemos estabelecer um padrão que mantenha a essência da mitologia grega antiga, inovando na sua concepção. Aqui está uma criação de tais nomes, cada um com um domínio imaginário que poderiam governar, integrando padrões e similaridades sutis entre si para criar uma sensação de unidade e familiaridade. 1. **Aeliox, o Guardião dos Ventos** - Dominando os sussurros e as tempestades, Aeliox combina a ancianidade do nome Aeolus (Deus dos ventos) com uma terminação que sugere novidade. 2. **Theronae, a Tecelã do Destino** - Inspirado em Themis e as Moiras, Theronae é aquela que entrelaça os destinos, mas com uma sonoridade que sugere tanto a tradição quanto uma nova dimensão de poder. 3. **Peliora, Protetora dos Mares** - Capturando a essência de Poseidon, Peliora traz uma vibração similar, mas com uma frescura feminina e uma aura de mistério ao redor das águas profundas. 4. **Dynastius, o Senhor da Guerra** - Inspirado em Ares, Dynastius tem uma ressonância que evoca poder e dominação, sugerindo uma entidade guerreira com influência universal. 5. **Phaeyra, a Flamula da Luz** - Remetendo a Apollo, deus da luz, e a Phaethon, Phaeyra apresenta uma conjunção de influências com um brilho próprio, governando não só a luz solar mas todo espectro luminoso. 6. **Nemelys, a Voz da Vingança** - Nemelys canaliza a energia de Nemesis, a deusa da vingança, com uma sonoridade que amplifica seu caráter implacável e justo. 7. **Zephylios, o Sopro da Vida** - Inspirado em Zephyrus, o deus gentil do vento oeste, Zephylios é muito mais do que a brisa; é o sopro vital que percorre todas as formas de vida, renovando-as. 8. **Eurynia, Guardiã da Paz** - Ecoando Eirene, a deusa da paz, Eurynia realça essa associação, mas apresenta uma presença mais abrangente que transcende a ideia tradicional de calmaria. 9. **Crysonoe, a Emissária das Profundezas** - Com uma homenagem a Criseis ou Circe e uma nodulação a Poseidon, Crysonoe é a eloquente exploradora dos mistérios ocultos sob mares e oceanos. 10. **Asteralius, o Errante Celestial** - Capturando a essência de Astéria, a deusa das estrelas e da noite, Asteralius vagueia pelos céus, uma entidade masculina ou neutra que guia as constelações e os viajantes noturnos. Para cada nome, suge-se um domínio que mistura elementos tradicionais da mitologia grega com interpretações e atribuições novas, refletindo uma modernidade no pensamento enquanto permanece arraigado às suas origens antigas."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Enemy's appearance could hint at its origins, abilities","completion":"Designing enemy concepts inspired by the \\"Dark Souls\\" series can be a thrilling challenge. The game is known for its intricate lore, challenging gameplay, and, most importantly, its memorable and often intimidating enemies. Each enemy not only contributes to the overall atmosphere but also tells a story of its own, hinting at its origins and abilities through its appearance. Let's craft a few concepts by focusing on different themes and settings: # 1. The Forgotten Paladin **Origin:** Once a noble knight sworn to protect the realm, now turned into a ghastly apparition haunting the remnants of a dilapidated cathedral. **Appearance:** The Forgotten Paladin wears rusted, but still majestic, full plate armor adorned with religious symbols, now partly covered in moss and dark ooze. Its helmet is slightly ajar, revealing a glimpse of a skeletal face with glowing eyes. Ethereal chains wrap around its arms, and a spectral shield and mace float beside it, ready to strike. **Abilities:** Able to summon ethereal weapons to attack from a distance or defend. It uses a mix of physical and dark magic attacks, and can call upon the spirits of fallen knights to aid in battle. # 2. The Abyssal Siren **Origin:** A creature born from the deepest, darkest ocean trenches, brought to the surface world by unnatural forces seeking to corrupt the land. **Appearance:** The Abyssal Siren has a hauntingly beautiful yet terrifying form, with long, flowing hair that seems to move with a life of its own. Her skin is a dark, iridescent blue, and her eyes glow with a bioluminescent light. Her legs are bound together, morphing into a grotesque tail fin that allows her to move swiftly on land or in water. **Abilities:** She can use her haunting song to mesmerize adventurers, drawing them closer before attacking with razor-sharp teeth and claws. The Siren can also manipulate water, casting powerful hydro-based spells. # 3. The Ember Beast **Origin:** Spawned from the heart of a volcano that was once used as a sacrificial site by a long-lost civilization. Its body is composed of molten rock and ember, with cracks in its surface glowing with intense heat. **Appearance:** A quadruped creature with a physique that resembles a cross between a wolf and a bear, but made entirely of rock and lava. It has a mane of flames and its eyes are pools of molten magma. **Abilities:** The Ember Beast can unleash fiery breath attacks, hurl molten rocks, and create rivers of lava to hinder its foes. It thrives in fiery environments and can rapidly regenerate when near sources of heat. # 4. The Shadowbound Assassin **Origin:** These were once elite soldiers of a secretive order that pledged their lives to guard an ancient secret, now reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, bound to serve an evil they once sought to contain. **Appearance:** Humanoid figures shrouded in tattered robes, their bodies are made of darkness and smoke, with eerie masks that resemble their once-human faces. They carry an array of ancient, cursed weapons. **Abilities:** Capable of blending into shadows, they can attack swiftly and without warning. They utilize stealth and deception, with an array of cursed attacks that can weaken, disorient, or directly harm their targets. These concepts blend visual design with narrative elements, allowing players to infer the history, motivations, and abilities of these enemies, enriching their gaming experience. Keep in mind that \\"Dark Souls\\" is lauded for its subtle storytelling and environmental storytelling; try to incorporate elements that players need to piece together themselves, enhancing the mystery and depth of your game world."},{"prompt":"У меня есть драйвер и приложение, которое с ним взаимодействует.

The morning sun filters through the dense canopy, casting a golden glow on an unconventional shower scene unfolding beneath it. Grabbing a rusted bucket, Jason ventures to a nearby stream, an expression of pure determination etched across his rugged, stubble-covered face. His blue eyes, a stark contrast to the wild environment, shine with the promise of the day’s antics. He fills the bucket and secures it onto a sturdy branch, stepping back to admire his makeshift shower with a grin that mirrors a kid's triumph in building a sandcastle. He strips, revealing a canvas of scars and tattoos that each tell a tale of survival, from the eerie depths of the ocean to the heart-stopping heights of the island's cliffs. As he undresses, a comedic relief is found not in the detailed description of his nudity but in his cheerful disregard for conventional modesty, embracing the freedom only a deserted island can offer. With a pull of the rope, the cold water cascades over him, eliciting a loud, refreshing sigh. “Ahh, nothing like a good ol' island shower to start the day!” he exclaims, vigorously scrubbing himself with a loofah he fashioned from island resources. The focus isn’t on the state of his armpits but rather on his content and almost childlike joy in finding comfort in the simplest of routines, amidst the insanity of his surroundings. Post-shower, he strolls to a mirror perched against a tree, a piece salvaged from a less fortunate adventurer. While brushing his teeth, Jason muses to himself, “You’re a long way from SoCal, Jay.” His reflection sports a quirky grin, a testament to how he’s adapted, finding laughter in the face of adversity. The quirkiest part of his morning routine involves breakfast. “Ah, time for the freshest catch of the day,” he chuckles, heading to a pond with a mischievous sparkle in his eye. “Let’s make some magic happen.” Standing waist-deep in water, he takes a deep breath, his face a picture of concentration and comedic anticipation. A few moments pass before he grunts and a series of bubbles emerge, causing a peculiar fishing technique that is as effective as it is hilarious. “And that, my friends, is how you catch fish with finesse and...natural gas!” he declares, scooping up the stunned fish. Building a campfire, he skewers the fish, cooking them to perfection. “Who needs a fishing rod when you’ve got talent like mine?” he jokes, speaking to an imaginary audience, or perhaps the island itself. His laughter fills the air, blending with the crackling of the fire. What makes Jason’s story so compelling isn’t the detailed physical embodiment, but the spirit of his resilience, ingenuity, and how he finds humor in the direst situations. His morning routine on Rook Island, far from mundane, is a testament to the human capacity for adaptation, and a reminder that sometimes, all you can do is laugh in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"Do a intermission for a crossover fanfic between Medaka Box, Call of Duty and the Tom Clancey shared media universe, in the form of a video report within the story by the

The revelation of the Flask Plan, an experiment that sought to transcend human limitations, has unveiled a dark underbelly of ambition and hubris.

His defiance, though rash, underscores a broader struggle for identity and belonging.\\" As the narration unfolds, Sir P weaves together the disparate threads of this complex saga, from the geopolitics of Japan's restored territories to the personal battles of those caught in the crossfire. \\"Our world is a tapestry of stories, each thread interlacing with the next to create a portrait of resilience and hope. As we stand witness to these tumultuous times, let us not forget the power of unity and the indomitable spirit of those who strive for a better tomorrow.\\" With a final nod to the gravity of the situation and the roles played by each character in this intricate dance of power, Sir P concludes, \\"Today, we have gazed into the abyss, and in the reflection, we find not just the shadows of our adversaries but the light of our collective resolve. This is Sir P, signing off.

and Taiwan before Korea was initally annexed by Japan in 1910 and Taiwan was initially annexed by Japan in 1898, how Japan lost Korea when the USA and Soviet Union invaded Korea and set up the DPRK and the ROK respectively, and how the Soviet Union and USA also stole Taiwan from Japan to help Chiang Kai Shek, the then leader of the ROC at the end of WW2, set up a ROC government in exile after

Welcome to Politricks Watch. This is Sir P,\\" the familiar voice of the Jamaica-based YouTuber booms over the speakers, his tone balancing the gravitas of the topics he discusses with a warmth that has hooked thousands of listeners worldwide. Before diving into the meat of his report, Sir P takes a moment to shout out his Patreon subscribers by name, extending heartfelt thanks for their support. \\"Today, we're explorin' a story that sounds like it's straight outta the pages of a high-octane thriller, mixed with supernatural elements that will make yuh wonder about the very fabric of our society. Now, before we go any further, let me remind yuh, the complexity of this situation spans across continents and involves entities that are, to say the least, extraordinary.\\" Sir P shifts gears, his voice adopting a serious tone. \\"In recent times, we've witnessed the decimation of a particularly nasty collaboration. We're talkin' 'bout a section of the Klansman gang, joinin' forces with the Gaza Empire. Them were buyin' weapons from neo-Confederate White supremacist factions of the Blue Dog Democrats. Aye, yuh heard me right.\\" He pauses for effect. \\"But who put an end to this ungodly alliance, yuh ask? It was none other than a covert paramilitary group, crafted from rogue elements of the Delta Force and the spies from the Division, alongside the infamous Ghosts. Now, these aren't your everyday heroes. Their existence was barely a whisper before they burst onto the scene with the kind of precision and ruthlessness that makes yuh think twice about the world we're livin' in.\\" \\"Now, onto some 'strange happenings' over in the land of the rising sun – Japan. Yuh see, Hakoniwa Academy, a prestigious educational institute, has been under the microscope. Rumors had been circlin' 'bout human experiments aimed at makin' superhumans called 'Abnormals.' Well, those rumors aren't rumors anymore. After the Ghosts and their allies took down the gun deal, they went public with their attack on the main labs of the so-called 'Flask Plan' right in the bowels of Hakoniwa Academy.\\" \\"But that's not all that's stirrin' the pot. No, sir. We have revelations that have shaken the very core of the student body at Hakoniwa Academy. Power players like Hansode, Mogana, Medaka, Myouga, and Nabeshima, all revealed to be married to none other than Hitoyoshi Zenkichi. And not just married, but expectin' his children. This has sent shockwaves across communities, ignitin' controversies that beg the question of ethics, power, and responsibility.\\" \\"Interestingly, there's this theory floatin' around about Zenkichi havin' Jamaican heritage. This notion stems from our 'breeder' culture, which, controversial as it may be, highlights a man's drive to father children with multiple women. This tie-in isn't just whimsical; it has layers, connectin' back to powerful families in Japan, alleged yokai masqueradin' as humans, and the peculiar and potent abilities exhibited by Jamaican scholarship students upon their return from Hakoniwa Academy.\\" Sir P takes a breath, his tone reflective. \\"In a bizarre twist, there's chatter 'bout ties between the aristocracy of Europe and East Asia with Jamaica, stirrin' up old tales and conspiracies that scratch the surface of our understandin' of history itself.\\" \\"Before I wrap up, let's touch on the case of Earlan Bartley, a.k.a. Alkaline, a figure shrouded in intrigue. Known in our story as leading a resistance under the guise of the Vendetta Clan against Abnormal supremacists, his stance is as admirable as it is risky. Caught in the crossfire, these students embody the fight against oppressors on multiple fronts.\\" \\"As we delve into these narratives, it's essential to remember the human element. Whether it's fighting against the Klansman gang, uncovering dark plots within elite educational institutions, or challenging supremacist ideologies, the line between right and wrong can sometimes blur.\\" Sir P concludes, his voice a blend of solemnity and optimism. \\"In a world marred by divisiveness and clandestine warfare, the stories of these young warriors remind us of the resilience of the human spirit. To the fighters in the shadows, yuh bravery does not go unnoticed. Stay strong, and remember, real power comes from upholdin' justice and protectin' those who cannot protect themselves.\\" \\"Thank you for tunin' into Politricks Watch. Dis was Sir P.

The Uplift Project emerges as a beacon of hope and innovation against this backdrop. It is a multifaceted initiative designed to bridge the digital divide and foster sustainable development by empowering underserved communities through education, access to technology, and skill development. This article delves into the origins, objectives, frameworks, and impacts of the Uplift Project, providing a comprehensive understanding of its significance in the digital age. Origins and Objectives The inception of the Uplift Project can be traced back to the realization of the widening gap between communities with easy access to digital technologies and those without. This divide not only exacerbates existing inequalities but also impedes the overall progress of society. The Uplift Project was founded on the principle that enabling access and fostering digital literacy are essential steps toward achieving global prosperity and equality. Its objectives are: - **Increase Access to Technology:** By providing underserved communities with the necessary technological tools, such as computers, internet access, and digital devices, the project aims to eliminate primary barriers to digital inclusion. - **Foster Digital Literacy and Education:** Understanding that access alone is not enough, the project focuses on educating individuals on how to effectively utilize technology, encompassing basic digital skills to more advanced computing knowledge. - **Empowerment Through Skill Development:** It focuses on skill development that aligns with current and future job markets, emphasizing coding, digital marketing, and data analysis, to name a few, thereby boosting employability. - **Sustainable Community Development:** The project aims for long-term impact, focusing on how technology can be used to address community-specific challenges, thus fostering local entrepreneurship and innovation. Frameworks and Implementation The Uplift Project operates through a series of meticulously designed frameworks that ensure its objectives are met efficiently and sustainably. These involve: - **Partnerships:** Collaborating with local governments, non-profits, and technology companies to secure resources and tailor the project to community needs. - **Volunteer Network:** Utilizing a global network of volunteers who offer their expertise in various domains, contributing to the project's educational and operational components. - **Curriculum Development:** Creating bespoke educational content that is both accessible to beginners and valuable to those seeking to advance their skills. - **Community Input:** Implementing feedback mechanisms whereby communities can express their needs and experiences, ensuring the project remains relevant and effective. Impact and Success Stories The Uplift Project has garnered significant attention for its impactful outcomes and success stories. Key achievements include: - **Increased Digital Accessibility:** Thousands of individuals have gained access to digital devices and the internet, opening up a world of information and opportunity. - **Enhanced Employability:** Participants have reported increased job prospects and incomes after completing the project's training programs, with some establishing their startups. - **Educational Advancements:** Schools in underserved regions have incorporated the project's curriculum into their teaching, thus broadening the impact. - **Community Empowerment:** By addressing specific needs—whether through agricultural technology or digital marketplaces—the project has played a pivotal role in transforming community economies. Challenges and Future Directions Despite its success, the Uplift Project faces challenges such as securing sustainable funding, adapting to rapidly changing technology landscapes, and scaling its impact without diluting quality. Future directions involve expanding its reach, refining its curriculum to include emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain, and strengthening partnerships for increased resource sharing. Conclusion The Uplift Project stands as a testament to the transformative power of technology when directed towards societal benefit. It underscores the fact that the digital divide is not an insurmountable barrier but a challenge that, with concerted effort and innovative solutions, can be overcome. As the project grows, its continued emphasis on empowerment, education, and community engagement offers a blueprint for how global citizens can unite to foster a more inclusive and prosperous digital future."},{"prompt":"Realiza un resumen de la siguiente escena de una película en menos de 100 palabras: P.

Elle est environ 1000 fois plus lumineuse que le Soleil et a un diamètre d'environ 7 fois celui du Soleil. Alcyone fait partie des étoiles les plus étudiées de l'amas des Pléiades en raison de sa luminosité et de sa proximité par rapport à la Terre."},{"prompt":"Dans la mythologie","completion":"Dans la mythologie grecque, Alcyone était une des sept filles d'Atlas, le titan qui porte le ciel sur ses épaules, et de Pléioné, une nymphe de la mer. Alcyone était mariée à Céyx, le roi de Trachine, et tous deux étaient connus pour s'aimer profondément. Cependant, un jour, Céyx partit en voyage en mer malgré les avertissements d'Alcyone sur les dangers qu'il courait. Alors que Céyx était en mer, Zeus, le roi des dieux, déchaîna sa colère et provoqua une tempête qui fit naufrager le navire de Céyx. En apprenant la mort de son mari, Alcyone implora les dieux de lui rendre son époux bien-aimé. Touchés par sa douleur et sa dévotion, les dieux transformèrent Alcyone en un oiseau appelé \\"martin-pêcheur\\" et ramenèrent Céyx à la vie sous forme d'oiseau. Les deux oiseaux restent ensemble pour l'éternité, construisant un nid sûr au-dessus de l'eau pour élever leurs petits. Dans certaines versions du mythe, Alcyone et Céyx sont associés aux Pléiades, un groupe d'étoiles dans la constellation du Taureau, et la mort de Céyx est liée à l'apparition de l'étoile Alcyone dans le ciel."},{"prompt":"Quelle relation avec Zeus ?","completion":"Dans le mythe d'Alcyone et Céyx, Zeus joue un rôle important en déclenchant la tempête qui finit par causer la mort de Céyx. Zeus est le roi des dieux dans la mythologie grecque et il règne sur le ciel et la foudre. Dans ce mythe, il est présenté comme un dieu tout-puissant et implacable, capable de déchaîner des tempêtes et de punir les mortels pour leur arrogance ou leurs transgressions. Lorsque Céyx part en mer malgré les avertissements d'Alcyone, il défie indirectement la volonté des dieux. Zeus, en colère face à cette impudence, utilise son pouvoir pour provoquer une tempête dévastatrice qui fait naufrager le navire de Céyx. Ce naufrage entraîne la mort de Céyx, déclenchant la détresse d'Alcyone qui implore alors les dieux de lui rendre son mari. La compassion des dieux envers Alcyone et leur décision de transformer le couple en oiseaux témoignent de la complexité des relations entre les dieux et les mortels dans la mythologie grecque. Bien qu'ils puissent être capricieux et implacables, les dieux peuvent aussi être compatissants et sensibles à la douleur et à la dévotion des mortels, comme dans le cas d'Alcyone et Céyx."},{"prompt":"Tu peux me décrire Céyx ?","completion":"Céyx était le roi de Trachine dans la mythologie grecque, et il était le mari d'Alcyone, la fille d'Atlas. Il était connu pour son amour profond pour Alcyone, et les deux étaient réputés pour former un couple uni et heureux. Céyx était un navigateur expérimenté et courageux, mais il était également loyal envers sa famille et son peuple. Malgré les avertissements d'Alcyone sur les dangers de voyager en mer pendant une tempête, Céyx partit en voyage, préférant affronter les risques plutôt que de convenir à sa femme. Malheureusement, Céyx fut victime d'une tempête provoquée par la colère de Zeus, le roi des dieux, et son navire fit naufrage. Il périt en mer, laissant Alcyone dévastée par sa mort. La tristesse et le chagrin d'Alcyone furent si intenses que les dieux décidèrent de les transformer en oiseaux, afin qu'ils puissent rester unis pour l'éternité. Céyx est souvent décrit comme un personnage courageux, loyal et aimant, dont le destin tragique illustre la puissance et la cruauté des dieux dans la mythologie grecque."},{"prompt":"Quels sont les exemples de la gentrification dans la commune de la N'sele qui seraient la conséquences de l'étalement continu?","completion":"Il n'est pas possible de répondre à cette question car la commune de N'sele n'est pas une zone où la gentrification est couramment observée, et il n'y a pas de données spécifiques sur les conséquences de l'étalement continu dans cette région. La gentrification implique généralement l'embourgeoisement d'un quartier initialement populaire, ce qui peut entraîner une hausse des loyers, une transformation de la composition sociodémographique de la population et une perte d'identité culturelle. Si la commune de N'sele venait à connaître un phénomène de gentrification, les conséquences pourraient être similaires à celles observées dans d'autres villes du monde, mais il est difficile de donner des exemples précis sans données concrètes sur cette région spécifique."},{"prompt":"Comment la commune de N’sele viendrait à connaître un phénomène de gentrification","completion":"La commune de N'sele pourrait connaître un phénomène de gentrification si elle devient de plus en plus attractive pour une population plus aisée, généralement en raison de facteurs tels que des investissements publics dans l'aménagement urbain, des améliorations des infrastructures, la proximité de services de qualité, ou encore des changements dans les politiques de logement. Si la commune de N'sele devient un lieu recherché par les populations plus aisées, cela pourrait entraîner une augmentation des loyers, la rénovation ou la construction de logements plus luxueux, ainsi qu'une transformation de la composition sociodémographique de la population locale. Cela peut également entraîner une perte d'identité culturelle pour les habitants d'origine et une exclusion sociale des populations à faibles revenus. Il est important de noter que la gentrification peut être un processus complexe et controversé, car elle peut avoir des effets positifs en termes de développement économique et urbain, mais aussi des effets négatifs en termes d'inclusion sociale et d'accès au logement. Ainsi, il est essentiel de mener une réflexion approfondie sur les politiques à mettre en place pour garantir un développement équilibré et inclusif dans les quartiers en voie de gentrification."},{"prompt":"Quelles peuvent être les activités de l'économie noire dans la commune de la N'sele?","completion":"La commune de N'sele, située à Kinshasa en République démocratique du Congo, peut être le théâtre de diverses activités liées à l'économie informelle, également appelée économie noire. Ces activités peuvent inclure : 1. Commerce informel : Vente de produits sur les marchés de rue, de fruits et légumes, de textiles, de produits artisanaux, etc. 2. Services informels : Prestations de services tels que la réparation de vélos ou de voitures, le coiffure, la couture, la manucure, etc. 3. Restauration informelle : Vente de nourriture dans les échoppes, les petits restaurants ou les stands de rue. 4. Transport informel : Taxi-motos, taxis-bus ou transport en commun informel. 5. Activités minières informelles : Exploitation minière artisanale de minerais tels que l'or, le diamant, le coltan, etc. 6. Recyclage informel : Collecte et recyclage des déchets, notamment du plastique, du métal, du verre, etc. Ces activités sont généralement caractérisées par des structures informelles, un accès limité aux protections sociales, des conditions de travail précaires et une taille réduite des entreprises. Elles jouent cependant un rôle important dans l'économie locale en offrant des opportunités d'emploi aux populations vulnérables et en contribuant à la dynamisation du secteur informel."},{"prompt":"Qu'est ce que l'éclosion urbaine","completion":"L'éclosion urbaine est un concept utilisé pour décrire le phénomène de développement rapide et non planifié des villes, souvent caractérisé par une croissance déséquilibrée, des infrastructures insuffisantes, des problèmes environnementaux et sociaux, et une pression sur les ressources urbaines. Ce phénomène est fréquemment observé dans les pays en développement où les villes connaissent une croissance démographique significative et rapide. L'éclosion urbaine peut être le résultat de divers facteurs tels que l'exode rural, l'urbanisation rapide, la pauvreté, le manque de planification urbaine, la faiblesse des institutions publiques, et la croissance économique déséquilibrée. Les conséquences de l'éclosion urbaine peuvent être multiples et inclure la prolifération de bidonvilles, l'augmentation du chômage, la congestion urbaine, la pollution, la précarité des conditions de vie, et la surcharge des infrastructures publiques telles que les transports, l'eau et l'assainissement. La gestion de l'éclosion urbaine est un défi majeur pour les autorités locales et nationales, qui doivent mettre en place des politiques urbaines et des plans d'aménagement du territoire adaptés pour accompagner la croissance des villes de manière durable, équitable et résiliente.

Ce processus est souvent observé dans les grandes agglomérations urbaines où la population et les activités économiques débordent progressivement du centre-ville vers les zones environnantes. Les causes de l'éclosion des périphéries en milieu urbain peuvent être multiples et inclure la recherche d'espace, de meilleures conditions de vie, de logements abordables, ou encore des investissements en infrastructures de transport qui rendent les déplacements vers les zones périphériques plus faciles. Dans de nombreux cas, les périphéries urbaines se développent de manière spontanée ou informelle, sans une planification adéquate, ce qui peut entraîner des problèmes tels que la dispersion urbaine, la congestion routière, la fragmentation sociale, ou encore des problèmes d'accès aux services de base. La gestion de l'éclosion des périphéries en milieu urbain est un enjeu crucial pour les autorités locales et nationales, qui doivent mettre en place des stratégies de planification urbaine visant à garantir un développement équilibré et durable des zones périphériques. Cela implique la mise en place d'infrastructures de transport efficaces, de logements de qualité, de services sociaux et d'équipements publics, ainsi que la préservation de l'environnement et des espaces verts pour assurer la qualité de vie des habitants des périphéries urbaines."},{"prompt":"Tu peux me citer les étoiles de la constellation du Taureau ?","completion":"Dans la constellation du Taureau (Taurus), il y a plusieurs étoiles notables, chacune ayant ses propres caractéristiques. Voici une liste des principales étoiles qui constituent cette constellation: 1. **Aldebaran (α Tauri)** - Aldebaran est la plus brillante étoile de la constellation du Taureau et représente l'œil du taureau. C'est une géante rouge située à environ 65 années-lumière de la Terre. Elle brille d'une lumière distincte rouge-orangée. 2. **Elnath (β Tauri)**, également appelée β Aurigae en raison de sa proximité avec la constellation du Cocher (Auriga), est la deuxième étoile la plus brillante de la constellation du Taureau. Elle se trouve à environ 131 années-lumière de la Terre. Elnath est une géante bleue-blanche. 3. **Hyadum I (γ Tauri)** est la principale étoile de l'amas des Hyades, qui forme la \\"tête\\" du taureau. C'est une géante jaune-orange située à environ 150 années-lumière. 4. **Ain (ε Tauri)** est une autre étoile des Hyades, située à proximité de Hyadum I. Elle est aussi une géante jaune, distante d'environ 155 années-lumière de la Terre. 5. **Taygeta (19 Tauri)**, **Maia (20 Tauri)**, **Electra (17 Tauri)**, **Merope (23 Tauri)**, **Alcyone (η Tauri)**, et **Asterope (Sterope, 21 et 22 Tauri)** font toutes partie de l'amas des Pléiades, un groupe d'étoiles facilement visible à l'œil nu, souvent appelé \\"les sept sœurs\\". Ces étoiles sont des étoiles bleues chaudes situées à environ 440 années-lumière. Alcyone est la plus brillante étoile de cet amas. 6. **Atlas (27 Tauri)** et **Pleione (28 Tauri)** sont aussi membres des Pléiades, et sont intéressantes pour les astronomes en raison de leur relation de binaires serrées. La position et la visibilité des étoiles dans la constellation du Taureau peuvent varier en fonction de votre localisation sur Terre et de la période de l'année, mais la constellation est surtout bien visible dans les ciels d'hiver de l'hémisphère nord."},{"prompt":"Alcyone tu peux m'en dire plus ?","completion":"Alcyone, connue aussi sous la désignation η Tauri (Eta Tauri), est l'étoile la plus brillante de l'amas ouvert des Pléiades, qui est l'un des objets célestes les plus connus et facilement repérables à l'œil nu dans le ciel nocturne. Voici quelques détails intéressants sur Alcyone : # Caractéristiques Physiques - **Type d'étoile** : Alcyone est classée comme une géante bleue de type spectral B7IIIe. Cela signifie qu'elle est plus chaude et plus massive que le Soleil. Le \\"e\\" dans sa classification indique la présence de lignes d'émission dans son spectre, caractéristique des étoiles de la séquence principale B avec des enveloppes de gaz autour d'elles. - **Magnitude** : Alcyone a une magnitude apparente d'environ 2,85, ce qui la rend relativement brillante dans le ciel nocturne, bien que sa luminosité soit atténuée par sa distance. - **Distance** : L'étoile est située à environ 440 années-lumière de la Terre. - **Système** : Alcyone est en fait un système multiple d'étoiles. Le système principal est constitué de quatre étoiles : Alcyone A (elle-même une binaire spectroscopique), B, C, et D. # Importance Culturelle et Historique - **Mythologie** : Dans la mythologie grecque, les Pléiades étaient les sept filles d'Atlas et de Pléione. Alcyone, en tant que l'une des Pléiades, est donc étroitement liée aux mythes entourant cette famille divine. Les Pléiades étaient souvent associées à la navigation, car elles étaient un repère important pour les marins. - **Astronomie** : Les Pléiades, et par extension Alcyone, ont été un point de repère important dans de nombreuses cultures à travers l'histoire, utilisées pour la navigation, le calendrier, et les rituels. # Observation - **Position dans le ciel** : Alcyone, avec le reste des Pléiades, se situe dans la constellation du Taureau. L'amas des Pléiades est facile à trouver : cherchez un petit regroupement dense d'étoiles qui ressemble à une petite cuillère ou un très petit chariot. Alcyone est la plus brillante parmi elles. - **Meilleur moment pour observer** : Les Pléiades peuvent être observées le mieux pendant les mois d'automne et d'hiver dans l'hémisphère nord, en cherchant la constellation du Taureau. En résumé, Alcyone est une étoile fascinante non seulement du point de vue astronomique, comme l'étoile principale d'un système multiple et l'étoile la plus brillante des Pléiades, mais aussi du point de vue culturel, en raison de son importance dans la mythologie et l'histoire humaine."},{"prompt":"Quelle relation entre Alcyone et Zeus","completion":"Dans la mythologie grecque, Alcyone est l'une des Pléiades, les sept filles d'Atlas, le Titan condamné à porter le ciel sur ses épaules, et de Pléione, une nymphe. La relation entre Alcyone et Zeus, le roi des dieux de l'Olympe, réside principalement dans les mythes entourant la conception des Pléiades. Selon la mythologie, Zeus s'est uni à plusieurs des Pléiades, y compris avec Alcyone, ce qui a conduit à la naissance de divers enfants. Les récits diffèrent selon les sources, mais certains mythes attribuent à Alcyone et Zeus la maternité et paternité de Hyrieus, un héros ou roi dans la mythologie grecque, bien que les associations exactes puissent varier entre les légendes. Les Pléiades en général jouent un rôle significatif dans de nombreux mythes grecs, étant souvent mentionnées dans des histoires qui incluent des thèmes de poursuite (souvent par le chasseur Orion) et de transformation, comme elles ont été finalement transformées en étoiles pour échapper soit à la poursuite d'Orion, soit à leur propre désespoir suite à la destinée tragique de leur père, Atlas. Il est important de noter que la mythologie peut varier considérablement d'une source à l'autre, et de nombreux mythes ont différentes versions, ce qui peut conduire à des incohérences concernant les relations familiales et les descendants des figures mythologiques. Dans le cas d'Alcyone, sa relation la plus directe avec Zeus se trouve dans le contexte de ces mythes de conception et de transformation."},{"prompt":"Quelle relation entre Alcyone Zeus et Céyx","completion":"La confusion autour de la figure d'Alcyone provient probablement de la présence de deux personnages distincts portant le même nom dans la mythologie grecque. D'une part, nous avons Alcyone comme l'une des Pléiades, fille d'Atlas et de Pléione, qui est liée à Zeus principalement par le contexte de la naissance des Pléiades. D'autre part, il existe une autre Alcyone, souvent associée à Céyx, qui est liée à une toute différente histoire d'amour tragique. # Alcyone et Céyx Cet Alcyone est la fille d'Éole, le dieu des vents, et non l'une des Pléiades. Son histoire avec Céyx, le roi de Trachis, est l'une des plus touchantes de la mythologie grecque et a été notamment racontée par le poète romain Ovide dans ses Métamorphoses. Alcyone et Céyx formaient un couple profondément amoureux. Après que Céyx ait péri en mer alors qu'il se rendait pour consulter l'oracle de Delphes, Alcyone, dévastée par la perte de son époux, se jeta à la mer après avoir vu son corps sans vie ramené par les vagues. Emus par leur amour et leur fin tragique, les dieux décidèrent de transformer Alcyone et Céyx en oiseaux halcyons (martinets ou rossignols selon les versions). Selon la légende, les jours halcyons sont une période de sept jours en hiver, pendant laquelle les tempêtes se calment traditionnellement en mer Méditerranée, permettant à l'oiseau Alcyone de nidifier en sécurité sur les vagues. Ce mythe sert à expliquer un phénomène météorologique autant qu'il témoigne des croyances anciennes sur le pouvoir de l'amour et de la transformation. # Distinction entre les Deux Alcyones Bien que Zeus ait joué un rôle dans le mythe des Pléiades, y compris avec Alcyone comme l'une des sept sœurs, sa connection directe est plutôt avec la Pléiade Alcyone. Le mythe de Céyx et Alcyone est séparé de cette lignée divine et n'implique pas Zeus de manière directe, concentrant plutôt l'attention sur la nature profondément humaine de leur amour et de leur tragédie. Pour résumer, bien que deux personnages nommés Alcyone existent dans la mythologie grecque, leur relation avec Zeus et les histoires qui les entourent sont distinctes et reflètent deux aspects très différents de la mythologie et des croyances de l'époque."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Alcyone et Céyx étaient mari et femme, et leur amour l'un pour l'autre était si profond qu'ils se considéraient comme Zeus et Héra, ce qui ne plut pas aux vrais Zeus et Héra. La tragédie commence lorsque Céyx décide de consulter l'oracle de Delphes pour comprendre pourquoi des malheurs s'abattaient sur son royaume. Pour ce faire, il devait entreprendre un long voyage en mer. Alcyone, craignant pour la sécurité de son époux, le supplia de ne pas partir, mais Céyx refusa et prit la mer. Malheureusement, lors de son voyage, une tempête violente provoquée par la colère des dieux fit chavirer son navire, et Céyx périt noyé. Zeus, prenant pitié d'Alcyone qui était inconsolable, envoya Morphée, le messager des rêves, sous l'apparence de Céyx pour révéler à Alcyone le sort de son mari. Lorsqu'elle apprit la nouvelle, Alcyone se jeta à la mer dans le désespoir. Les dieux, émus par leur amour tragique, les transformèrent tous les deux en martinets (ou alcyons, selon certaines versions), des oiseaux qui sont souvent associés à la tranquillité des mers, car selon la légende, les alcyons font leur nid sur la mer, et Éole retient les vents pour les empêcher de déferler pendant cette période, créant ainsi des jours de calme appelés \\"jours alcyoniens\\". Ainsi, dans cette histoire, la relation entre Alcyone et Zeus est moins une connexion directe et plus une interaction tragique où les actions de Zeus, en réaction à l'arrogance présumée de Céyx et Alcyone, ont conduit à leur transformation et à la création de la légende des jours alcyoniens."},{"prompt":"Tu peux me décrire Céyx","completion":"Céyx était un personnage de la mythologie grecque, souvent décrit comme le roi de Trachis, une ville située dans la Grèce centrale. Céyx était le fils d'Eosphoros (ou parfois Hespéros), la personnification de l'étoile du soir, ce qui le place dans une lignée divine. Il était marié à Alcyone, fille d'Éole, maître des vents. Le couple était célèbre pour son bonheur et son amour profond, mais leur destin fut tragiquement bouleversé, conduisant à leur transformation en oiseaux par les dieux, une histoire qui s'inscrit dans un récit plus large sur le pouvoir de l'amour et la compassion divine. En termes de caractéristiques personnelles et d'actions, Céyx est souvent décrit comme un roi dévoué et aimant, bien que son choix de partir en voyage en mer malgré les avertissements d'Alcyone mène à la tragédie. Sa décision de consulter l'oracle de Delphes reflète les pratiques de l'époque, où les rois et les mortels cherchaient souvent des conseils et la volonté des dieux face à des troubles ou des décisions importantes. Après sa mort en mer et la suite de sa transformation avec Alcyone en martinet par les dieux, la légende de Céyx et d'Alcyone devient un symbole de l'amour éternel et de la compassion des divinités, avec un accent particulier sur le phénomène naturel connu sous le nom de \\"jours alcyoniens\\", une période de calme en mer supposée être causée par leur nidification. Comme c'est le cas pour de nombreuses figures de la mythologie grecque, les détails de la vie et de la personnalité de Céyx sont principalement transmis par le prisme des valeurs, des leçons morales et des croyances culturelles de l'époque, mettant en lumière les interactions entre les humains et le divin, ainsi que les conséquences parfois imprévues de nos actions."},{"prompt":"Merge the following versions of the same prototype for a crossover fanfic between Seirei Gensouki, Code Geass, Dragonar Academy, the Eminence in Shadow, the Familiar of Zero, Bladedance of Elementalers, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Monster Girl Encyclopedia and Monster Girl Quest into a single narrative that combines the best aspects of both prototypes while sticking to the setting of a clockpunk-based magic world with a good amount of steampunk and dieselpunk technology and some very early cyberpunk influence: Prototype Chapter 1: Chapter Twelve: The Garden’s Task and the Knights’ Crusade Deep within the recesses of an uncharted forest, cloaked by enchantment and technology, lay the newly discovered vestiges of ancient grandeur. Here, the secretive operatives of Shadow Garden convened, their murmurs a melding of languages that had traversed both empires and epochs. They stood at the heart of what once was a NATO base, now repurposed for a cause far more arcane. We’ve found something incredible here, a boon from our master Zero, the members thought collectively, a harmony of English, Russian, Bulgarian, French, German, and Yiddish minds working in awe-inspired tandem. The air around them crackled with the raw energies of techno-magic as they refurbished the derelict halls—interdimensional chambers unknown to them as doorways to another Earth. Shimmering screens glowed to life, and gears meshed seamlessly with spells as they toiled beneath the guidance of their elusive, visionary leader. Это технологии древней цивилизации… Мы должны восстановить это, they surmised, the mechanic alchemists engrossed in their labor. (This is technology of an ancient civilization… We must restore it.) Their dedication to the eradication of the Cult of Diablos—a malevolent force in the throes of wielding a demonic power—was unwavering. The Black Knights, an assembly of individuals once fractured across nations, now united, shared in this commitment, their cause bound by common purpose. Les ténèbres ne régneront pas éternellement, mused a French Shadow Garden member, his hands dancing across a control panel infused with beguiling sorcery. (Darkness will not reign forever.) Their dominion was one of intellect and intrigue, the pursuit of freedom from Diablos’ ancient, twisting grasp a calling etched in their souls. Amidst the steam and shadow of early cyberpunk’s edge, their campaign stretched before them—a silent war waged in the bleak places where myth and machinery met. Across this dichotomy, a myriad of other Black Knights stood poised, ready to leverage their array of skills in pursuit of Zero’s directive. From the data analysts whose screens flickered with lines of code and arcane sigils to the field operatives whose training blended martial prowess with mystical affinity, each played their integral role. Vereinigt unter einer Fahne werden wir die Welt vom Schatten befreien, they vowed in a blend of German and Yiddish precision, the pride of their chosen path unwavering. (United under one flag, we shall free the world from shadow.) As these covert machinations unfolded against the tableau of steam-billowing industries and clockwork’s intricate dance, the stage was set for a saga of power and revolution, of hidden truths and the fight for a world ungoverned by the claw of tyranny. The chapter draws to a close with the final image: operatives of Shadow Garden and the Black Knights standing resolved within the labyrinthine complexity of the old base, their eyes and thoughts cast forward, to what victories and revelations the morrow might bring in their crusade for a world unbowed. — [First version of the prototype chapter ends here] Prototype Chapter Version 2 — Chapter Thirteen: Vestiges of the Void The renovated stronghold stood stoic in the wilderness, a monument to ambition and resourcefulness. Zero—clad in enigmatic armor—strode through the newly established halls with the assuredness of a monarch surveying his elaborate court. His eyes, sharp beneath his visor, darted from one innovation to the next—steam-powered computation engines whirring, arcane crystals humming in enchantment-powered circuits, all harmoniously woven into an intricate tapestry of clockwork precision and emergent technology. “Subete umaku itte iru,” he remarked inwardly, the Romanized Japanese marking his silent approval of the technological wonders rising from the repurposed base. (“Everything is proceeding well,” he remarked inwardly, the Romanized Japanese marking his silent approval of the technological wonders rising from the repurposed base.) The documents of the base’s former Earthly tenants lay scattered across a grand oaken desk, each sheet a potential beacon towards the knowledge Zero sought. With meticulous care, he sorted through the papers, extracting every detail about the interdimensional gateway. “Nous avons fait des découvertes intéressantes, monsieur,” a member of Shadow Garden reported, his French crisp amidst the backdrop of clanking gears and puffing pistons. (“We have made some interesting discoveries, sir,” a member of Shadow Garden reported, his French crisp amidst the backdrop of clanking gears and puffing pistons.) Zero lifted a sheet, eyes scanning the diagram before him, a gateway device at its center. “Excellent. Continuez à travailler sur la réplication de leurs technologies,” he instructed, his command a fusion of French, English, and Russian, catered to the multilingual expertise of his crew. (“Excellent. Continue to work on replicating their technologies,” he instructed, his command a fusion of French, English, and Russian, catered to the multilingual expertise of his crew.) The Black Knights, serving as the security detail, scrutinized every corner, their vigilance embodied in their murmured conversations. “Keep an eye on the perimeter,” one instructed in English, while another replied in Russian, “Понял, безопасность превыше всего.” (“Understood, security above all,” another replied in Russian, “Понял, безопасность превыше всего.”) As the dance of invention continued to unfold within the land command center, Zero remained focused on the ultimate prize; bridging worlds was no minor feat, and yet, it seemed within their grasp. The integration of Earth’s advanced military and computational technology only bolstered their capability, bringing the once-fictional notions of early cyberpunk into tangible reality. Satisfied with the progress, but knowing the journey of discovery was far from complete, Zero allowed himself a moment of contemplation. The gateway puzzle remained incomplete—the motive of NATO’s incursion through dimensions hung unanswered. “Kono hikari to kage no sekai de… jibun no michi wo,” he pondered as the light of day waned, a silhouette against the immense windows overlooking the sprawling domain he sought to control. (“In this world of light and shadow… I carve my own path,” he pondered as the light of day waned, a silhouette against the immense windows overlooking the sprawling domain he sought to control.) The chapter drew to a close with Zero veiled in thought. The complex symphony of steampunk and early cyberpunk elements around him sang of trials, tribulations, and triumphs to come—of hidden doors soon to be prized open by the hands of a ruler unbound from a single realm. — [Second version of the Prototype chapter ends here]","completion":"In the dense, uncharted woodlands veiled by a rich tapestry of enchantment and technological marvels, the stronghold of innovation and secrecy known as the Shadow Garden stood as a beacon of hope and determination in a clockpunk world edging toward the twilight of steam, diesel, and early cyberpunk advancements. Its inhabitants, the elite operatives and visionary leaders of this clandestine organization, labored under the command of the enigmatic figure known only as Zero, their duties inscribed in the language of arcane spells and the whispers of cutting-edge machinery. The remnants of an ancient NATO base, discovered hidden beneath layers of history and magic, had been transformed into a nexus of interdimensional inquiry and technological salvation. The base, once a symbol of earthly conflict and ambition, now harbored the collective might and intellect of a group dedicated to a singular, daunting task: the eradication of the Cult of Diablos and the exploration of dimensions beyond their own. As Zero, clad in armor that whispered of mysteries forged in the depths of uncharted worlds, strode through the renovated halls, his vision crystal clear, the stronghold buzzed with activity. Steam-powered computation engines and enchantment-laced circuits worked in harmony, a symbiosis of the clockpunk and nascent cyberpunk eras coming to life under his watchful eye. \\"Subete umaku itte iru,” he observed, his internal monologue a blend of cultural insights that spanned the globe. (“Everything is proceeding well,”) The documents scattered across the grand oaken desk in what served as the central command were not mere paper and ink but keys to unlocking the potential that lay in bridging worlds. As members of Shadow Garden reported their findings, their voices melded in a symphony of languages, each note a testament to the diverse origins of those who had joined Zero's cause. “Nous avons fait des découvertes intéressantes, monsieur,” one operative reported, the click-clack of gears and the steady puff of pistons a relentless backdrop to their endeavors. (“We have made some interesting discoveries, sir,”) The repurposed base, a labyrinth of technological wonders and arcane mysteries, bustled with the concerted efforts of those who had pledged themselves to Shadow Garden and the assembly of Black Knights. Their vigilance was unyielding, their commitment unwavering as they spoke in tongues that crossed borders, “Keep an eye on the perimeter,” woven with, \\"Понял, безопасность превыше всего.” (“Understood, security above all,”) Zero’s ambition, however, stretched beyond the immediate confines of their stronghold. The puzzle of the gateway and the dimension-spanning endeavors of NATO's lost ambitions beckoned, a challenge that spurred them forward. The fusion of Earth’s military might with the fantastical elements of their home world promised a future where the constraints of one realm could be overcome by the strengths of another. As dusk settled over the sprawling, clockwork-laden expanse of their domain, Zero stood silhouetted against the vast windows of the command center, a figure carved from the precipice of change. \\"Kono hikari to kage no sekai de… jibun no michi wo,\\" he contemplated, the setting sun casting long shadows over a world teetering on the cusp of revolution. (“In this world of light and shadow… I carve my own path,”) This chapter, a converging point of dedication, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of a vision unbound by temporal or dimensional constraints, drew to a close with a promise — a declaration that in the intricate dance of steam, shadow, and the glimmer of cybernetic dreams, a new dawn was within reach. The operatives of Shadow Garden and their allies, the Black Knights, stood ready, their gazes fixed on the horizon, where the battles of tomorrow awaited in their crusade for a world freed from the shadows of tyranny and the chains of the past."},{"prompt":"Höhenmeter von Leermos Österreich","completion":"Lermoos, ein Dorf in Tirol, Österreich, liegt auf einer Höhe von etwa 1.004 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel.

**کاشت مستقیم (بذرپاشی):** اگرچه کاشت مستقیم برنج کمتر رایج است، اما در صورت استفاده از این روش، کاشت باید کمی زودتر از کاشت نشاء، یعنی حدود اواسط اردیبهشت تا اوایل خرداد انجام شود تا از بارندگی‌های اواخر بهار برای تسهیل جوانه‌زنی بذور استفاده شود. # نکات مهم: - **بررسی تقویم کشاورزی:** همیشه قبل از کاشت، باید تقویم کشاورزی منطقه و پیش‌بینی‌های آب و هوایی را بررسی کنید تا از شرایط ایده‌ال برای کاشت اطمینان حاصل شود. - **آماده‌سازی زمین:** آماده‌سازی اصولی زمین قبل از کاشت، شامل شخم زدن و بهبود زهکشی، برای اطمینان از رشد مطلوب برنج بسیار مهم است. - **مدیریت آبیاری:** برنج به آب فراوان نیاز دارد. بنابراین، تأمین آب کافی برای شالیزار، خصوصاً در اوایل دوره رشد، اهمیت بالایی دارد. با توجه به تغییرات اقلیمی و پیش‌بینی‌های آب و هوایی که ممکن است از سالی به سال دیگر دچار نوسان شوند، توصیه می‌شود به اطلاعات و هشدارهای محلی در زمینه کشاورزی توجه کنید. همچنین، مشورت با کشاورزان محلی و متخصصان کشاورزی که با شرایط خاص منطقه آشنایی دارند، می‌تواند به تعیین دقیق‌ترین زمان کاشت کمک کند."},{"prompt":"بنظرت به زبان فارسی بهتر صحبت میکنی یا به انگلیسی؟","completion":"با توجه به اینکه طراحی و آموزش من بر اساس زبان انگلیسی و مجموعه داده‌هایی با حجم بیشتری به این زبان بوده است، معمولاً قدرت و دقت بیشتری در تولید و درک متن‌های انگلیسی دارم. با این حال، توانایی من در پردازش و تولید متون به زبان فارسی نیز بسیار قابل توجه است، به خصوص به دلیل پیشرفت‌های اخیر در فناوری‌های یادگیری ماشین و هوش مصنوعی که به من اجازه می‌دهد زبان‌های مختلفی را درک و بازتولید کنم. اما نسبت به زبان انگلیسی، ممکن است در جزئیات و پیچیدگی‌های زبان فارسی، گاهی اوقات دقت کمتری داشته باشم."},{"prompt":"بنظرت میتونی وقتی یه چیزی رو به زبان انگلیسی بهت اموزش میدن وقتی ازت به فارسی سوال کنن جواب بدی؟","completion":"بله، توانایی انتقال دانش و اطلاعات از زبانی به زبان دیگر یکی از قابلیت‌های کلیدی مدل‌های زبانی مدرن مانند من است. وقتی اطلاعاتی به من در زبان انگلیسی ارائه می‌شود، من می‌توانم آن دانش یا اطلاعات را درک کرده و در پاسخ به سوالات به زبان فارسی یا هر زبان دیگری که در محدوده دانش من باشد، بازتاب دهم. این توانایی نتیجه آموزش مدل با داده‌های بسیار گسترده‌ای است که شامل چندین زبان مختلف می‌شود و به من اجازه می‌دهد تا مفاهیم را فراتر از زبان اصلی فهمیده و در زبان‌های دیگر بیان کنم. این توانایی به ویژه در مواردی که دانش یا اطلاع خاص از پیش در مدل من وجود داشته باشد، بیشتر به چشم می‌خورد. با این حال، همواره باید در نظر گرفت که دقت در ترجمه و بازتولید اطلاعات در زبان دیگر ممکن است تحت تأثیر محدودیت‌های دانش کنونی مدل و کیفیت آموزش آن در آن زبان خاص قرار گیرد."},{"prompt":"میتونی بگی به اینکه یک مدل زبانی بتونه با یادگیری یه داده به زبان مثلا انگلیسی به سوال های فارسی پاسخ بده به انگلیسی چی میگن؟","completion":"در زبان انگلیسی، توانایی یک مدل زبانی برای یادگیری داده‌ها به یک زبان و پاسخگویی به سوالات در زبان دیگر را می‌توان به عنوان \\"cross-lingual understanding\\" یا \\"cross-lingual transfer\\" توصیف کرد. این اصطلاحات به مفهوم قابلیت یک سیستم هوش مصنوعی برای درک و پردازش داده‌ها به زبانی و اعمال یا بیان آن دانش به زبان دیگری اشاره دارند. این توانایی بخشی از پژوهش‌های گسترده‌ای در حوزه‌‌ی چندزبانگی (multilingualism) در یادگیری ماشین است و برای ایجاد مدل‌های زبانی فراگیر که قادر به خدمترسانی در مقیاس جهانی هستند، اهمیت دارد."},{"prompt":"سم رانداپ چیه؟","completion":"رانداپ (Roundup) نام تجاری یک آفت‌کش غیرانتخابی است که فعال‌ترین ماده آن گلایفوسیت (Glyphosate) می‌باشد. گلایفوسیت به عنوان یک عامل کشنده علف‌های هرز گسترده‌ای استفاده می‌شود و می‌تواند قبل از کاشت یا رشد محصولات، برای کنترل علف‌های هرز بکار رود. این ماده آفت‌کشی باعث اختلال در مسیر شیکیمات در گیاهان می‌شود که برای سنتز برخی از اسیدهای آمینه‌های ضروری استفاده می‌شود، در نتیجه باعث مرگ گیاه می‌گردد. استفاده از گلایفوسیت و به طور خاص، رانداپ، در سراسر جهان متداول است، اما در سال‌های اخیر مورد بحث و جدال بوده است. نگرانی‌هایی در مورد اثرات بالقوه سمی بودن آن برای انسان و محیط زیست به وجود آمده است. برخی تحقیقات پیشنهاد داده‌اند که ممکن است ارتباطی بین استفاده از گلایفوسیت و برخی مسائل سلامتی، مانند خطر افزایش ابتلا به لنفوم غیرهوچکین و اثرات زیست محیطی نامطلوب وجود داشته باشد، هرچند بحث و تحقیقات بیشتری در این زمینه نیاز است. به دلیل این نگرانی‌ها، کاربرد و فروش رانداپ و سایر ترکیبات حاوی گلایفوسیت در برخی از کشورها و مناطق تنظیم شده یا محدود شده است. توصیه می‌شود کاربران در هنگام استفاده از این محصولات از تمهیدات ایمنی لازم پیروی کنند و همیشه مطابق با دستورالعمل‌های توصیه‌شده توسط تولیدکننده و قوانین محلی عمل کنند."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Напиши текст, который ты видишьASSISTANT: На изображении представлен скриншот текстового обмена сообщениями, где написано: И давно ты в Ягдж переехала жить?)

Here's a detailed recipe to create mouth-watering Masala Vadai: # Ingredients: - 1 cup Chana Dal (split chickpeas), soaked for 4-6 hours - 2-3 Dry Red Chilies (adjust to taste) - 2 Green Chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste) - 1 inch Ginger, finely chopped - 1-2 cloves Garlic (optional) - 1/2 cup Onion, finely chopped - 2 tbsp Cilantro (Coriander leaves), finely chopped - 10-12 Curry Leaves, finely chopped - 1 tsp Fennel Seeds (Saunf) - Salt, to taste - Oil, for deep frying # Instructions: 1. **Preparation**: - Drain the soaked Chana Dal and keep aside a handful of dal. - In a grinder, add the remaining chana dal, dry red chilies, ginger, and garlic. Grind it coarsely without adding water. The mixture should not become a paste but should have some texture. 2. **Mixing**: - Transfer the ground mixture into a mixing bowl. - Add the reserved whole chana dal, finely chopped onions, green chilies, cilantro, curry leaves, fennel seeds, and salt to the ground mixture. - Mix everything thoroughly. Check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. 3. **Shaping**: - Take a small portion of the mixture and form a ball. Flatten the ball to form a patty. Ensure the patties are not too thick, as this might result in uncooked centers. 4. **Frying**: - Heat oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. To test if the oil is ready, drop a small piece of the mixture into the oil; if it sizzles and comes to the surface, the oil is ready. - Gently slide the formed patties into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan. - Fry the vadai on medium heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. It should take about 4-5 minutes. Ensure to flip them halfway through for even cooking. - Once done, remove the vadai with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil. 5. **Serving**: - Serve the Masala Vadai hot with coconut chutney or mint chutney as an appetizer or snack. # Tips for Perfect Masala Vadai: - **Consistency of the batter**: The key to crispy vadai lies in the consistency of the batter. It should be coarse. - **Freshness of Ingredients**: Fresh ingredients significantly enhance the flavor of the vadai. - **Temperature of the Oil**: Maintain a medium heat for frying. If the oil is too hot, the vadai will brown quickly without cooking properly inside. If the oil is not hot enough, the vadai will absorb excess oil and become soggy. - **Avoid Water**: Do not add water while grinding the dal. The moisture from the washed dal is usually sufficient. Enjoy making this delicious snack! Perfecting Masala Vadai might take a couple of tries, especially getting the consistency and frying temperature right, but once you master it, it becomes an easy and beloved treat."},{"prompt":"How to make an extremely delicious beef bajji?","completion":"Beef Bajji is not a traditional dish commonly found in recipes or culinary traditions, as Bajji is typically an Indian snack made of vegetables coated in a chickpea flour batter and deep-fried. However, incorporating beef into a Bajji-like recipe could be an innovative fusion dish, combining elements of Indian cuisine with the rich flavors of beef. Given the unconventional nature of Beef Bajji, and acknowledging it might be a creative culinary experiment rather than a classic recipe, here's how you could attempt to make a delicious, crispy beef snack inspired by Bajji: # Ingredients: - 500g beef (preferably tender cuts like sirloin or tenderloin), thinly sliced - 1 cup chickpea flour (Besan) - 2 tbsp rice flour (for extra crispiness) - 1-2 tsp red chili powder (adjust based on heat preference) - 1 tsp turmeric powder - 1 tsp garam masala - 1 tsp cumin powder - Salt, to taste - A pinch of baking soda (to make it fluffy) - Water, as needed to make the batter - Fresh coriander (cilantro), finely chopped - 1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional) - 2-3 cloves of garlic, minced - 1 inch piece of ginger, minced - Oil, for deep frying # Instructions: 1. **Marinate the Beef**: - In a bowl, mix the thinly sliced beef with half the quantities of red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin powder, salt, ginger, and garlic. Let it marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the fridge for deeper flavor infusion. 2. **Prepare the Batter**: - In another bowl, mix the chickpea flour, rice flour, the remaining spices (red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin powder), salt, baking soda, chopped coriander (cilantro), and green chilies. - Gradually add water to the mix until you get a thick but flowing batter. The consistency should be such that it can coat the beef slices without dripping off excessively. 3. **Coat the Beef**: - Take the marinated beef slices and dip them individually into the batter, ensuring each slice is well coated. 4. **Fry the Beef**: - Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully drop the batter-coated beef slices into the oil. - Fry them in batches to avoid overcrowding, which can lower the oil's temperature and result in soggy bajjis. - Fry each batch until golden brown and crispy, about 3-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of the slices. - Remove the beef bajjis from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. 5. **Serving**: - Serve the crispy beef bajji hot, accompanied by mint chutney or ketchup for dipping. This fusion recipe combines the savory, spicy flavors characteristic of Indian bajjis with the hearty, rich texture of beef, creating an unusual but potentially delicious snack. Adjust the spices according to your personal taste preferences. Enjoy your innovative cooking experiment!"},{"prompt":"Fill in the blanks.

Here’s a breakdown of the main differences: 1. **Speed**: One of the most noticeable differences is in the maximum speeds. 4G networks can achieve speeds of up to 1 Gbps, which is already fast and sufficient for most current uses like streaming HD videos. 5G, on the other hand, aims to provide speeds up to 10 Gbps or more. This means significantly faster downloads and uploads, enabling more data-intensive applications like 4K/8K video streaming, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). 2. **Latency**: Latency refers to the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer. 5G aims to drastically reduce this delay to as low as 1 millisecond, compared to 4G's latency of around 20-30 milliseconds. Lower latency is crucial for real-time applications, such as online gaming, real-time control of devices and vehicles (including autonomous driving), and for the overall responsiveness of applications. 3. **Capacity and Connectivity**: 5G technology uses a wider range of frequencies, including the previously unused millimeter-wave part of the spectrum, allowing it to support a significantly higher number of devices per square kilometer. This is particularly important in densely populated areas and for the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing millions of devices to be connected simultaneously. 4. **Efficiency and Energy Consumption**: 5G networks are designed to be more efficient and energy-friendly, supporting more data transfer with less energy use, which is crucial for battery-operated devices. This efficiency comes from advanced technologies used in 5G infrastructure and the network's ability to concentrate energy towards receivers rather than dispersing it in all directions. 5. **Infrastructure and Deployment**: The deployment of 5G requires the installation of a lot of new infrastructure because of its use of higher frequency bands (like millimeter waves) which have shorter range and cannot penetrate obstacles as effectively as the lower frequencies used by 4G. This means more cell towers and small cells must be installed to ensure coverage and to deliver the high-speed and low-latency benefits of 5G. 6. **Network Slicing**: 5G introduces the concept of network slicing, which allows multiple virtual networks to be created on top of a common physical infrastructure. This means that telecom operators can provide tailored connectivity services that meet the specific needs of different industries or technologies, offering varying levels of speed, capacity, and latency. 7. **Improved Connectivity**: With 5G, not only the speed but the reliability of the connection is significantly improved, meaning that the connections are more stable even in crowded areas or during high demand times. In summary, while 4G has already revolutionized mobile internet, offering fast speeds and high-capacity networks, 5G represents a significant leap forward, promising to enable new applications and technologies, from smart cities to autonomous vehicles, with its higher speeds, lower latency, and massive device connectivity."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Malheureusement, sans plus d'informations concrètes sur la fiche technique ou le détails des titres, il est difficile de fournir une analyse approfondie de ce CD. La cornemuse, étant un instrument de musique caractéristique de nombreuses cultures à travers le monde, possède une richesse culturelle particulière dans chaque région. En France, les styles et les traditions de jeu peuvent varier considérablement d'une région à l'autre, influencés par l'histoire locale, les danses traditionnelles et les mélodies folkloriques. Le fait que ce CD soit dédié à la région de l'Ain suggère une exploration ou une célébration des traditions musicales spécifiques à cette zone, potentiellement mettant en lumière des compositions, des arrangements ou des techniques de jeu uniques. Les morceaux contenus sur le disque pourraient présenter un mélange de pièces traditionnelles et de compositions nouvelles, illustrant la diversité et la vitalité de la musique folklorique dans l'Ain. Sans accès à la fiche technique détaillée ou à la liste des titres, il est malheureusement impossible de fournir des détails sur les artistes impliqués, les types de cornemuses utilisées (il existe une grande variété d'instruments sous la famille des cornemuses, chacun ayant ses propres caractéristiques sonores), ou les contextes spécifiques des pièces sélectionnées.

Miller. This nonfiction self-development book is written in a free-flow format, with the author openly sharing her best with the audience. She seems to write from a depth of understanding, compassion, and grace. Despite its unique formatting, which blends writing and workbook elements, the format and content of the book are compatible, enhancing the essence of the entire work. \\"The MISOGI Method\\" discusses the concept of a self-created goal or objective that helps individuals become better versions of themselves. Interestingly, it does not impose a particular practice; rather, it gently urges readers to find their own MISOGI, leading them to define their own practice. It is one of the few books I have come across that does not try to sell a methodology; instead, it freely gives and remains transparent. It is complete in itself and can sensibly be used by anyone interested. The approach is one of trust, setting boundaries to prevent self-harm, and explaining and illustrating MISOGI enough for readers to grasp its essence. The sharing is unconditional, and Jody treats readers as equals. I have no suggestions to improve this book. Even its imperfections add to its beauty, and the unsaid adds value. It is simply beautiful. I rate this book 5 out of 5 for content, organization, consideration, and compassion for readers, as well as the sheer brilliance of the work. It is simple yet complex, random yet sensible, truthful yet considerate, and graceful yet honest. It is one of the best self-improvement books I have read. I would recommend this book to anyone drawn to it. If you don't understand it in one go, reading it again and again may lead to revelations. While the book offers a framework, it is not about the framework but about you and how this framework could help you become a better version of yourself. It is a book worth buying, and I recommend it to everyone drawn to it after reading the synopsis. For those who choose to read it - Happy Misogi.","completion":"Upon diving into \\"The Misogi Method\\" by Jody B. Miller, I was immediately engrossed by the author's narrative style. This nonfiction book, dedicated to self-development, doesn't follow the conventional path taken by most in its genre. Instead, Miller opts for a free-flow format, where her thoughts and teachings cascade seamlessly across the pages. The prose she employs is not just mere words but a profound dialogue between her deep understanding, compassion, and the reader. This unique format, a blend between prose and workbook, surprisingly works to the book's advantage, enriching the essence of Miller's message without losing the reader along the way. Miller introduces us to the concept of MISOGI—a self-imposed goal or objective designed to push individuals towards becoming superior versions of themselves. What sets this book apart is its resistance against prescribing a one-size-fits-all methodology. Instead, it encourages readers to embark on their journey of discovery, to find and define what MISOGI means personally to them. This aspect of personalization is what makes the book shine, offering a template that each reader can tailor to fit their individual needs and aspirations. \\"The Misogi Method\\" stands out not only for its content but also for its ethos. Miller doesn't approach her readers as a mentor preaching from a pedestal but as an equal. Her transparency and generosity in sharing her methodology are profound. There are no secrets held back, no hidden fees—just a genuine desire to aid others in their quest for self-improvement. This approach cultivates a trust and rapport between Miller and her readers, emphasizing safe practice and self-exploration above all. The book respects its audience's intelligence, offering enough information to understand MISOGI while encouraging personal interpretation and application. Upon reflection, I find myself at a loss for suggestions on how Miller could improve her work. The book's imperfections, if any, contribute to its character, adding a layer of authenticity often missing from the self-help genre. The deliberate ambiguity invites readers to explore between the lines, incentivizing engagement and deeper reflection. \\"The Misogi Method\\" is a testament to the beauty in imperfection and the value in unsaid words. Rating this book anything less than 5 out of 5 wouldn’t do justice to Miller’s accomplishments in content, organization, compassion, and insightful consideration for her readers. \\"The Misogi Method\\" intricately weaves simplicity with complexity, randomness with sensibility, and truthfulness with kindness. It stands tall as a pinnacle of self-improvement literature, guiding readers not with rigid frameworks but with gentle invitations to introspection and self-betterment. I wholeheartedly recommend \\"The Misogi Method\\" to anyone feeling an intrinsic pull towards it. Those who may not fully grasp its concepts on the first read will find that further exploration and repeated readings unravel deeper insights and understanding. The book, while presenting a framework, subtly reminds us that it's not about the framework itself but about the individual journey towards self-discovery and improvement it facilitates. For anyone sitting on the fence after reading the synopsis, take the leap, immerse yourself in Miller's wisdom, and embark on your unique MISOGI journey. Happy Misogi to all who dare to dive in."},{"prompt":"01.Ain à Bourg en Bresse dans cornemuse (1:28) (2009) - CD : Ain dans cornemuse (2009) - 8 titres - Durée totale : 68:18 - fiche technique du détails CD","completion":"Artiste : Inconnu Titre : Ain à Bourg en Bresse dans cornemuse Année : 2009 Album : Ain dans cornemuse Nombre de titres : 8 Durée totale : 68:18 Fiche technique détaillée : non spécifié"},{"prompt":"Professeur Layton et la boîte de Pandore Date de sortie en pays :","completion":"Professeur Layton et la Boîte de Pandore a été initialement publié au Japon le 29 novembre 2007.

Поэтому я изучаю тему постапокалипсиса в массовой культуре в разных странах. Скажи правду ли я в следующих утверждениях о самых популярных образах апокалипсиса: 1. В США популярна концепция рейнджеров, что бродят по миру борясь с преступностью (в основном пустоши по типу прений, но встречаются и заснеженные районы ближе к границе с канадой), при этом это часто носит характер ретрофутуризма и бандитов в образе панков и металлистов. Как примеры я увидел Fallout и Wasteland. 2. В России и некоторых странах СНГ (Украина, Беларусь, Казахстан) популярна концепция сталкеров, что бродят по опасных зонах в поисках артефактов, при этом это часто носит характер \\"бандитских 90-х\\" и бандитов в образе гопников. Как примеры я увидел Stalker.","completion":"Ваши утверждения достаточно точно отражают популярные образы апокалипсиса в массовой культуре США и стран бывшего СССР. Позвольте дать вам более детальное описание этих контекстов: 1. **США**: Да, концепция рейнджеров, бродящих по постапокалиптическому миру, действительно популярна в США, как это видно в таких играх, как Fallout и Wasteland. Эти игры олицетворяют ретрофутуризм и представляют мир, в котором сочетаются элементы олд-скул технологий и научной фантастики с атмосферой постапокалипсиса. Стиль панков и металлистов является распространенным образом для бандитов в этих играх, создавая узнаваемую и уникальную атмосферу. Образы пустошей и изредка заснеженных районов также встречаются, создавая ощущение обширного и разнообразного мира после катастрофы. 2. **Россия и страны СНГ**: Концепция сталкеров, особенно как она представлена в серии игр S.T.A.L.K.E.R. и в романе братьев Стругацких \\"Пикник на обочине\\" (на котором основана серия игр), действительно популярна. Эти истории не только отражают культурное наследие \\"бандитских 90-х\\", но и углубляются в уникальную тематику исследования Зоны – таинственной территории, полной аномалий и артефактов, появившейся после неопределенной катастрофы. Бандиты в этих сюжетах часто изображаются в образе гопников, добавляя к специфике постсоветского апокалипсиса. Эти образы вносят в постапокалиптическую тематику яркие культурные оттенки, основанные на реальной истории и социальных настроениях. В обоих случаях этот фонд образов обогащает массовую культуру и предоставляет разнообразный материал для исследования и использования в новых произведениях, таких как ваша игра. Важно отметить, что при взятии вдохновения из этих источников, стоит также уделять внимание уникальным культурным аспектам и особенностям, чтобы создавать глубокие и насыщенные произведения."},{"prompt":"А как с этим делом обстоят дела в китайской литературе, фильмах и играх? Какой образ у китайцев популярен также как в США рейнджеры и в СНГ сталкеры?","completion":"В китайской массовой культуре образы постапокалипсиса также присутствуют, однако они могут существенно отличаться от американских и постсоветских направлений из-за культурных, исторических и идеологических различий. # Особенности китайской постапокалиптики: 1. **Научная фантастика и утопии**: В Китае научная фантастика и утопические образы получили развитие с определенной задержкой от Запада, но в недавнее время они стали набирать популярность. Авторы как Лю Цысинь (Liu Cixin), например, известный своей трилогией \\"Воспоминания о прошлом Земли\\", исследуют космические и временные парадигмы, но апокалиптические мотивы в его работах зачастую связаны с глобальными, космическими угрозами или вопросами выживания человечества. 2. **Элементы китайской мифологии и истории**: В китайской анимации (донхуа), литературе и кино часто используются элементы традиционной китайской мифологии и истории, переработанные в контексте футуристических или постапокалиптических сценариев. Это добавляет уникальный культурный оттенок и отличает китайскую постапокалиптику от западной. 3. **Игры и визуальные произведения**: По сравнению с американскими и российскими, в Китае также развиваются компьютерные игры с постапокалиптическими темами. И хотя может показаться, что им нет ярко выраженного уникального \\"лица\\", как у рейнджеров или сталкеров, китайские игры и визуальные произведения часто включают элементы традиционного китайского искусства и философии. Важно заметить, что китайское регулирование контента и цензура влияют на развитие жанров и тематик, доступных для исследования авторами и разработчиками. Это может объяснить, почему определённые нарративы становятся более популярными или развиваются в уникальном направлении в сравнении с западными аналогами. # Пример из современной культуры: - **\\"The Wandering Earth\\" («Блуждающая Земля»)**: Это китайский научно-фантастический фильм, основанный на одноимённом рассказе Лю Цысина. Хотя фильм не является постапокалиптическим в прямом смысле этого слова, он исследует мотивы глобальной катастрофы и сплочения человечества ради выживания, что придаёт ему постапокалиптическое звучание в более широком смысле. Китайская постапокалиптика предлагает уникальное и разнообразное видение будущего человечества, интегрируя традиционные и современные влияния."},{"prompt":"Такой ответ про китайский постапокалипсис меня не устроит. Сделай в виде следующего шаблона: В Китае популярна концепция [название группировки или образа на подобии американских рейнджеров и русских сталкеров], что [какой деятельностью они знамениты], при этом это часто носит характер [в стиле чего?] и бандитов в образе [в образе кого?]. Как примеры я увидел [название произведения]. Пример ответа: 1. В США популярна концепция рейнджеров, что бродят по миру борясь с преступностью (в основном пустоши по типу прений, но встречаются и заснеженные районы ближе к границе с канадой), при этом это часто носит характер ретрофутуризма и бандитов в образе панков и металлистов. Как примеры я увидел Fallout и Wasteland. 2. В России и некоторых странах СНГ (Украина, Беларусь, Казахстан) популярна концепция сталкеров, что бродят по опасных зонах в поисках артефактов, при этом это часто носит характер \\"бандитских 90-х\\" и бандитов в образе гопников. Как примеры я увидел Stalker.","completion":"Извините за путаницу в предыдущем ответе. Давайте попробуем сформулировать по вашему запросу: На момент последних доступных данных до 2023 года, в китайской массовой культуре не существует строго определённой и широко известной концепции на подобие американских рейнджеров из Fallout или русских сталкеров из S.T.A.L.K.E.R., которая была бы универсально распознаваема и повсеместно присутствовала в китайских произведениях жанра постапокалипсис. Китайская массовая культура и литература, включая научную фантастику и постапокалиптические произведения, склоняется к более разнообразным темам и сюжетам, которые могут включать элементы традиционной китайской культуры, современные технологические утопии или дистопии, и отражать социальные, экологические проблемы современной Китая и мира. Таким образом, моя попытка составить ответ по вашему шаблону может выглядеть так: В Китае на текущий момент нет широко распространённой и узнаваемой концепции на подобии американских рейнджеров или русских сталкеров, которая была бы привязана к постапокалиптическому жанру и имела бы ярко выраженную единую идентичность или группировку героев, ассоциируемую со спасением мира или исследованиями опасных зон. Скорее, китайское постапокалиптическое нарративное пространство характеризуется многообразием подходов, отражающих уникальный социокультурный и исторический контекст Китая. Это не означает отсутствие интереса к постапокалиптическим сюжетам в Китае; скорее здесь можно наблюдать другие мотивы и проблематики, такие как борьба против экологических катастроф, вопросы социальной адаптации после глобальных кризисов, или приключения в мире, где традиционная китайская культура и современные технологии переплетаются в уникальный и неповторимый способ, которые могут воплощаться в различных жанрах, включая кино, литературу и видеоигры."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update.

As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co.

I'd love to hear about your alternate history scenario. Please go ahead and share the details."},{"prompt":"In this timeline, the USSR never left its Stalinist stage. Vyacheslav Molotov \\"lawfully\\" became Soviet leader in 1954. Khrushchev was to be arrested because of his anti-stalinist views but he escaped to North Korea. In communist Albania, several soviet officials who had anti-stalinist views set up a separate communist party, a provisional government, if you will.","completion":"That's a fascinating scenario you've crafted. Let's explore the implications and potential developments that could arise from such alternate historical events: 1. **Molotov's Leadership:** - Vyacheslav Molotov, being a staunch Stalinist, would likely have continued and perhaps even intensified Stalinist policies. This could mean a more repressive regime internally, with continued purges, forced labor camps, and strict state control over the economy and society. - Molotov's foreign policy might have been more aggressive or uncompromising than Khrushchev's, possibly affecting the dynamics of the Cold War. He might have been less inclined to engage in diplomacy, leading to heightened tensions with the West. 2. **Khrushchev's Escape to North Korea:** - Nikita Khrushchev fleeing to North Korea presents a unique twist. He might have tried to influence North Korean policies, possibly promoting de-Stalinization or other reforms from there, though his ability to do so would heavily depend on how much influence he could wield in his exile. - His presence in North Korea might also alter the dynamics of the Korean War's aftermath and North Korea's relationship with both the USSR and China, possibly leading to a different trajectory for the country. 3. **The Albanian Provisional Government:** - The establishment of a separate Communist Party or provisional government in Albania by Soviet officials with anti-Stalinist views would represent a significant schism within the international communist movement. This could lead to a sort of civil war within communism, paralleling the Sino-Soviet split but potentially even more personal due to the shared history and close connections between the actors involved. - Depending on the support this Albanian Provisional Government could muster, both domestically and internationally (possibly from Yugoslavia, China, or even the West as a way to destabilize the Soviet sphere), this could lead to significant changes in the balance of power within Eastern Europe and the broader communist world. 4. **Wider Cold War Implications:** - A USSR that never leaves its Stalinist stage could either become more isolated due to its aggressive stance and internal repression, or it could double down on its efforts to export revolution, leading to more direct confrontations with the West. - Relations with China might also take a different turn, especially if Mao sees a hardened Stalinist USSR as either a model to emulate or a rival for leadership of the global communist movement. In crafting further narratives for your scenario, considerations like the economic implications of continued intense centralization, the impact on the Soviet populace, and how the global south aligns in this Cold War scenario could also add rich layers to the story. Keep in mind the butterfly effect—small changes can lead to significant unforeseen consequences, making alternate history a compelling and complex genre to explore."},{"prompt":"Meanwhile in the US, it also never left the stage of McCarthyism and adopted a... MUCH harder foreign policy. For example, the US sent 50.000 troops during the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and in 1963, Cuba's communist government fell. Che Guevara was arrested by U.S. military police troops and spent 6 years in prison.","completion":"Integrating such dramatic shifts in U.S. policy and actions in your alternate timeline further escalates the Cold War tension and creates an even more divergent historical trajectory. Let's delve into the repercussions and developments that could arise from this intensified U.S. stance: 1. **Prolonged McCarthyism and Hardline Foreign Policy:** - The continuation and intensification of McCarthyism would have deep domestic repercussions, likely leading to even greater suppression of political dissent, a more paranoid and fearful public psyche, and possibly the weakening of democratic institutions and protections of civil liberties. - A much harder foreign policy stance could catalyze a more confrontational global atmosphere. U.S. involvement in geopolitical affairs would be more direct and militaristic, potentially leading to escalated conflicts in various regions of the world. 2. **The Bay of Pigs Invasion and Fall of Communist Cuba:** - A successful U.S. intervention in Cuba, significantly altering the outcome of the Bay of Pigs Invasion by deploying 50,000 troops, would dramatically shift the balance of power in the Caribbean and have wide-reaching effects on American and Soviet foreign policies. - The fall of Cuba's communist government in 1963 would not only remove a key Soviet ally in the western hemisphere but also could embolden U.S. efforts to counteract socialism and communism worldwide. This might lead to more aggressive U.S. interventions in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. 3. **Che Guevara's Arrest:** - Che Guevara's arrest and imprisonment by U.S. forces would symbolize a significant victory for the U.S. in its fight against communism. Guevara's iconic status as a revolutionary leader means his capture would have profound propaganda value, demoralizing left-leaning movements globally while emboldening anti-communist forces. - However, it could also make him a martyr in the eyes of many, potentially galvanizing further revolutionary movements. His imprisonment would be a focal point for both condemnation and support from various international actors. 4. **Global Reactions and Consequences:** - The Soviet's likely response to a more aggressive U.S. foreign policy and the loss of Cuba could range from an escalation in arms build-up, including nuclear arsenals, to more direct support for communist guerilla movements globally in an effort to counter U.S. influence. - China’s position in this scenario becomes even more critical as it navigates its relationship with an increasingly hardline USSR and a confrontational U.S. Beijing might pursue a more independent or even opportunistic foreign policy, positioning itself as an alternative leader within the communist world or seeking détente with the West to counterbalance Soviet influence. - U.S. relations with non-aligned and third-world countries would also be affected. Nations wary of neocolonialism and imperialism might be more hesitant to align with the U.S., leading to a more multipolar world with several centers of power and influence. This scenario sets the stage for a Cold War that could potentially turn hot in numerous flashpoints around the globe. The polarization would not just be geopolitical but deeply ideological, affecting nations internally and in their interactions with each other. The potential for proxy wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions increases, with the global balance of power constantly in flux. The narrative threads and character arcs that can emerge from such a complex geopolitical tableau are vast and varied, offering rich material for further exploration in your alternate history scenario."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Contudo, este uso é frequentemente considerado pejorativo ou desrespeitoso por praticantes e adeptos dessas religiões. A palavra \\"macumba\\" em si originalmente pode ter se referido a instrumentos musicais de percussão de origem africana usados em rituais religiosos. Com o tempo, na linguagem coloquial brasileira, o termo passou a ser aplicado de forma abrangente, às vezes de maneira equivocada, para designar rituais, feitiços ou trabalhos espirituais associados às religiões afro-brasileiras. É importante destacar que a Umbanda e o Candomblé são religiões complexas e ricas, com suas próprias doutrinas, divindades (Orixás, Voduns, Inkices), rituais e filosofias. Elas possuem componentes de veneração aos ancestrais, uso de cantos, danças, oferendas, e práticas de caridade e auxílio espiritual. Essas religiões enfatizam a conexão com o sagrado, o respeito aos elementos da natureza, e a busca por equilíbrio e harmonia na vida dos seus praticantes. O uso desrespeitoso do termo \\"macumba\\" ignora a profundidade e o respeito que essas tradições merecem.

The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update.

It is on in the early mornings, replacing Doraemon, which is being removed from the schedule. - And finally, to which many will call the sad part of the update. Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley, Top Cat, Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics and The Flintstones will be removed. The 4am classics lineup is replaced with The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Other than that, the night schedule is more or less the same, swamped with blocks of Skatoony, The Garfield Show and KikoRiki. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Garfield Show 4:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers It's no surprise that Doraemon hasn't been given a warmer welcome on Boomerang, and to the United Kingdom as well. As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co. Guess that owl is finally getting the pedestal he deserves. Glad to see it back, Hope they do the same for Doraemon EDIT: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is NOT leaving the schedule, but it is being reduced to only a double bill at 4:00. The Owl and Co replaces it's other slots December has no schedule changes, other than new episodes of Tom and Jerry in New York at 5pm, only other change is at Christmas, when the Christmas specials of verious shows air January highlights on Boomerang UK: - New episodes of The Garfield Show continue to air throughout the month - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who gets a special marathon event on weekends - The Owl and Co continues to air in its new time slots - Ben 10 has a special marathon event to celebrate the show’s anniversary - Skatoony and KikoRiki continue to dominate the late-night schedule - The Flintstones return for a special throwback marathon event on weekends - Regular Show makes a surprise return to the daytime schedule, replacing Tom and Jerry in New York - Stay tuned for more updates and exciting programming on Boomerang UK! 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Ben 10 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - Regular Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Feburary Highlights on Boomerang UK Chaotic is new, replacing Ben 10 in all slots, Regular Show is also gone, replaced with more Garfield Show 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Chaotic 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Chaotic 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - Chaotic 18:30 - The Flintstones 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Stay tuned for more changes and new programming updates on Boomerang UK!

Для 32-битного целого числа (int32) результат побитового сдвига будет зависеть от значений, используемых в операции, но в рамках лимитов 32-битной архитектуры. В языках программирования, таких как C, C++, Java, побитовые сдвиги работают следующим образом: 1. **Побитовый сдвиг влево (<<)** увеличивает число, сдвигая биты влево на указанное количество позиций. Младшие биты заполняются нулями. 2. **Побитовый сдвиг вправо (>>) для знаковых чисел** уменьшает число (если оно положительное) или делает его более отрицательным (если оно отрицательное), сдвигая биты вправо на указанное количество позиций. Знаковый бит (самый старший бит, указывающий на знак числа) копируется в старшие позиции, что сохраняет знак числа. Этот тип сдвига иногда называют \\"арифметическим сдвигом вправо\\". 3. **Побитовый сдвиг вправо (>>>) для беззнаковых чисел** (в языках, поддерживающих эту операцию, таких как Java) сдвигает биты вправо, заполняя старшие биты нулями, что может привести к получению большого положительного числа, если исходное число было отрицательным. Сущность зависимости от размера числа заключается в следующем: при побитовом сдвиге эффект операции зависит от того, на сколько битов сдвигается значение, и от того, какие биты были в значимых позициях до сдвига. Если в целом 32-битном числе происходит сдвиг, ограничения по размеру означают, что любые биты, \\"выходящие\\" за границы 32 битов, будут потеряны. Например, сдвиг числа 2 (бинарное 10) влево на 1 позицию даст 4 (бинарное 100), а сдвиг на 31 позицию переместит бит установленного значения в самую старшую позицию, давая 0x80000000 в шестнадцатеричном формате. Сдвиг того же значения на 32 позиции или больше (в зависимости от языка программирования и его реализации операции сдвига) может вернуть исходное число или 0, так как сдвиг на количество битов, равное или превышающее размер типа переменной, обычно не имеет смысла и результат может быть неопределенным. Таким образом, да, результат побитового сдвига действительно зависит от исходного числа, но сдвиг всегда применяется в контексте ограничений размера типа данных (в данном случае 32 бит)."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update. Times are listed in GMT format. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - Doraemon 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Casper's Scare School 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Flintstones 4:30 - Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics 4:55 - Dastardly & Muttley 5:20 - Wacky Races 5:40 - Top Cat October Highlights on Boomerang UK: - Tom and Jerry marathon during half term - New episodes of Mr. Bean at 4pm - Doraemon is being removed completely, due to what appeared to be intentional sabotage by only airing it at 07:30 in the morning. - Ninjago returns to the schedule, replacing Casper's Scare School - For some unknown reason, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is back on the schedule. It is on in the early mornings, replacing Doraemon, which is being removed from the schedule. - And finally, to which many will call the sad part of the update. Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley, Top Cat, Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics and The Flintstones will be removed. The 4am classics lineup is replaced with The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Other than that, the night schedule is more or less the same, swamped with blocks of Skatoony, The Garfield Show and KikoRiki. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Garfield Show 4:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers It's no surprise that Doraemon hasn't been given a warmer welcome on Boomerang, and to the United Kingdom as well. As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co.

Glad to see it back, Hope they do the same for Doraemon EDIT: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is NOT leaving the schedule, but it is being reduced to only a double bill at 4:00. The Owl and Co replaces it's other slots December has no schedule changes, other than new episodes of Tom and Jerry in New York at 5pm, only other change is at Christmas, when the Christmas specials of verious shows air January highlights on Boomerang UK: - New episodes of The Garfield Show continue to air throughout the month - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who gets a special marathon event on weekends - The Owl and Co continues to air in its new time slots - Ben 10 has a special marathon event to celebrate the show’s anniversary - Skatoony and KikoRiki continue to dominate the late-night schedule - The Flintstones return for a special throwback marathon event on weekends - Regular Show makes a surprise return to the daytime schedule, replacing Tom and Jerry in New York - Stay tuned for more updates and exciting programming on Boomerang UK! 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Ben 10 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - Regular Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Feburary Highlights on Boomerang UK Chaotic is new, replacing Ben 10 in all slots, Regular Show is also gone, replaced with more Garfield Show 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Chaotic 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Chaotic 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - Chaotic 18:30 - The Flintstones 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Stay tuned for more changes and new programming updates on Boomerang UK!

Однако есть некоторые нюансы, которые стоит учитывать. 1. **Левый побитовый сдвиг** (\`<<\`) умножает число на 2 в степени, равной количеству сдвигов. Для типа \`int32\`, если результат умножения превышает максимальное значение для \`int32\`, которое равно 2,147,483,647, произойдет переполнение, и результат может быть не тем, что вы ожидаете. Например, пусть у вас есть число, которое после сдвига превышает максимально возможное значение для типа \`int32\`. В таком случае результат может быть отрицательным числом из-за того, как в памяти компьютера представляются отрицательные числа (дополнительный код). 2. **Правый побитовый сдвиг** (\`>>\`) для знаковых типов данных (\`int32\` является знаковым) делит число на 2 в степени, равной количеству сдвигов, но также сохраняет знак числа. Для беззнаковых типов данных правый сдвиг просто делит число на 2 в степени, равной количеству сдвигов, без учета знака. В обоих случаях, сдвиг на 2 будет означать умножение на 2^2 (или деление на 2^2 для правого сдвига), независимо от исходного размера числа. Важно понимать, что в языках программирования, таких как C, C++, Java, и других, поведение побитовых сдвигов может зависеть от многих факторов, включая тип данных (знаковый или беззнаковый), размер типа данных, количество битов для сдвига, а также от компилятора и архитектуры процессора. Так что ответ в общем случае - нет, побитовый сдвиг на 2 не зависит от размера числа, но результат операции может отличаться в зависимости от значения числа и специфики ситуации."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

HPLC was done to determine this on an experiental batch of pectin extracted via microwave. The results of the HPLC are as follows: 37.2% galacturonic acid (smooth pectin), 23.5% cellulose, 11.2% Xylose/Fructose/Mannose/Rhamnose (mix of hemicellulose and hairy pectin regions) , 16.8% Arabinose, 7.1% Levoglucosan and 4.2% others (formic acid, acetic acid and levulinic acid). Talk about this in the format of a results section of a research paper, going into depth about each part of the HPLC results.","completion":"# Results Determination of Galacturonic Acid Content in Pectin by HPLC The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the galacturonic acid content in a batch of pectin extracted using a novel microwave-assisted extraction method, to assess its conformity with the standards set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which mandates a minimum of 65% galacturonic acid content for pectin. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses were conducted to quantify the galacturonic acid content alongside other constituent sugars. The results are discussed below. Galacturonic Acid Content HPLC analysis indicated that the pectin contained 37.2% galacturonic acid. This value is significantly lower than the JECFA stipulation, suggesting that the pectin extracted using the microwave-assisted method under the conditions applied in this experiment does not meet the regulatory requirements for pectin. The subpar level of galacturonic acid could potentially affect the gelling properties of the pectin, as galacturonic acid is crucial for pectin's functionality as a gelling agent. Cellulose Content The analysis also revealed a cellulose content of 23.5%. The presence of cellulose in the pectin sample suggests some degree of contamination or inclusion of plant material that has not been adequately separated during the extraction process. This level of cellulose could potentially affect the purity and quality of the pectin, thereby influencing its functionality in food and pharmaceutical applications. Hemicellulose and 'Hairy' Pectin Regions The HPLC results showed a combined percentage of 11.2% for xylose, fructose, mannose, and rhamnose. These sugars are indicative of the presence of hemicellulose and components of the 'hairy' regions of pectin molecules, suggesting a diverse composition of the extracted substance. This diversity in sugar composition can influence the physicochemical properties of the pectin, particularly its solubility and gelation capacity. Arabinose Content A significant portion of the sample comprised arabinose (16.8%), a monosaccharide commonly associated with the side chains of pectin molecules. The relatively high content of arabinose may reflect a predominant extraction of arabinan-rich pectic polysaccharides, which can impact the texture-modifying properties of the pectin when used in food formulations. Levoglucosan and Other Components The presence of levoglucosan (7.1%) and other minor components such as formic acid, acetic acid, and levulinic acid (total 4.2%) was also noted. Levoglucosan is a breakdown product of cellulose and could indicate that the microwave extraction process led to some degree of pyrolysis or thermal decomposition of the plant material. The acids detected, on the other hand, might be degradation products or extraction solvents residues, which highlight the need for process optimization to minimize these by-products potentially affecting the pectin's purity and performance. Summary In summary, the HPLC analysis of the experimental batch of pectin extracted using microwave-assisted technology indicated a galacturonic acid content below the requirement set by JECFA. The presence of significant amounts of cellulose, hemicelluloses, arabinose, levoglucosan, and other minor components suggest that the extraction process, under the conditions applied, may not provide a highly purified pectin. These findings underscore the necessity for further optimization of the extraction parameters to enhance the yield and purity of galacturonic acid in pectin, ensuring compliance with international quality standards and improving its applicability in various industrial applications."},{"prompt":"go into more depth about the galacturonic acid result","completion":"In-Depth Analysis of Galacturonic Acid Content in Pectin The galacturonic acid content, as determined by HPLC, was found to be 37.2% in the extracted pectin sample. This value is significantly below the minimum recommended threshold of 65% by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), a criterion established to ensure the functional integrity of pectin as a gelling agent in food products. Galacturonic acid is the main constituent of pectin, playing a pivotal role in its gelling properties, which are essential for its application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The markedly lower percentage of galacturonic acid observed in our study suggests several potential implications and areas for further investigation. Implications of Suboptimal Galacturonic Acid Content 1. **Gelling Properties**: The efficacy of pectin as a gelling agent is predominantly attributed to its galacturonic acid content. Galacturonic acid units in pectin chains are responsible for the formation of the gel matrix, primarily through interactions with divalent cations like calcium. A lower concentration of galacturonic acid could result in pectin with inferior gelling capacity, which may limit its utility in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic applications where gel formation is desirable. 2. **Molecular Weight Considerations**: The observed galacturonic acid content may also reflect the molecular weight distribution of the pectin sample. Generally, a high molecular weight pectin contains a greater proportion of galacturonic acid. The reduced galacturonic acid content suggests that the extraction process might have led to the breakdown of pectin molecules, yielding a product with a lower average molecular weight. This could affect not only the gelling strength but also the viscosity, another crucial functionality of pectin in certain applications. 3. **Impact on Purity and Efficiency**: The suboptimal galacturonic acid content raises questions about the purity and efficiency of the microwave-assisted extraction technique used. The presence of other sugars and components, as detected, suggests an incomplete separation of pectin from the plant matrix or a partial degradation of pectic substances during the extraction. This indicates the need for refining the process parameters, such as temperature, time, and solvent use, to enhance the selective extraction of high-purity, high-galacturonic acid pectin. Potential Strategies for Improvement 1. **Optimization of Extraction Conditions**: Fine-tuning the microwave-assisted extraction parameters could enhance the yield of high-galacturonic acid pectin. Variables such as microwave power, extraction time, and the acidity of the extraction medium are critical factors that could influence the integrity and yield of extracted pectin. 2. **Use of Pectinolytic Enzymes**: Incorporating specific enzymes to selectively break down non-pectic substances without degrading the pectin could improve the galacturonic acid content in the final product. Enzymatic treatment could aid in more efficient separation and purification of pectin from plant materials. 3. **Post-Extraction Purification Steps**: Implementing additional purification steps, such as alcohol precipitation, dialysis, or membrane filtration, could help remove impurities and concentrate the pectin solution, potentially increasing the galacturonic acid percentage. Conclusion In conclusion, the suboptimal galacturonic acid content of 37.2% in the pectin sample extracted via microwave-assisted method underscores the need for methodological improvements to align with JECFA standards. The integrity of pectin's functional properties, pivotal for its industrial applications, hinges on its galacturonic acid content. Therefore, optimizing extraction and purification techniques to enhance the galacturonic acid yield is vital for producing high-quality pectin suitable for the demands of various applications. Further research should focus on process optimization and the evaluation of other innovative extraction methods to obtain pectin with a higher galacturonic acid content, ensuring its functional efficacy and compliance with international quality standards."},{"prompt":"how could the galacturonic acid result be so low","completion":"The significantly low galacturonic acid content observed (37.2%) in the pectin sample, as opposed to the minimum requirement of 65% by JECFA, raises several possible explanations. These factors vary from the initial choice of raw material to the specifics of the extraction and analytical methods applied. Here, we explore the potential reasons behind the low yield of galacturonic acid in greater detail: # 1. **Choice of Raw Material** - **Variability in Raw Material**: Different plant sources have varying pectin compositions. The low galacturonic acid content could stem from the use of a raw material inherently low in pectin or in which pectin is not predominantly composed of galacturonic acid. - **Maturity of Plant Material**: The age or maturity of the plant material can significantly affect the pectin quality. Younger plants tend to have pectin with higher molecular weight and potentially higher galacturonic acid content, while older plants may yield pectin that is more degraded or has been altered in composition. # 2. **Extraction Conditions** - **Extraction Method**: Microwave-assisted extraction, while innovative and effective for rapid extraction, might not always provide the optimal conditions for preserving the integrity of galacturonic acid or for extracting pectin in its purest form. Overheating or incorrect settings could lead to degradation or modification of pectin. - **Solvent pH and Composition**: The pH and the type of solvent used in the extraction process greatly influence the integrity and yield of pectin. An unsuitable pH or solvent choice could have led to partial hydrolysis of the pectin, reducing the galacturonic acid content. - **Extraction Time and Temperature**: Excessive extraction times or higher temperatures than needed can degrade pectin, leading to a breakdown of its galacturonic acid chains, resulting in lower measured content. # 3. **Degradation During Extraction or Analysis** - **Thermal Degradation**: The high temperatures involved in microwave-assisted extraction can potentially cause thermal degradation of galacturonic acid, leading to breakdown products that might not be detected as galacturonic acid during HPLC analysis. - **Chemical Degradation**: The extraction process could involve or induce chemical reactions, such as esterification or de-esterification, that alter the structure of pectin, thereby reducing the measurable galacturonic acid content through the formation of derivatives that are not recognized as such by the analytical method used. # 4. **Analytical Method Limitations** - **HPLC Method Specificity and Sensitivity**: The choice of HPLC parameters, including the column, mobile phase, detectors, and their settings, could influence the efficiency and specificity of galacturonic acid detection. Inadequate method development or optimization might result in underestimation of the galacturonic acid content. - **Sample Preparation**: The process of preparing the pectin sample for HPLC analysis, including any purification or concentration steps, could lead to loss or modification of the galacturonic acid, especially if harsh conditions are applied. # 5. **Interference and Contaminants** - The presence of other substances in the extracted pectin, such as sugars, acids, or by-products of extraction, might interfere with the accurate quantification of galacturonic acid by competing for detection or causing co-elution during HPLC analysis. In conclusion, the surprisingly low galacturonic acid content observed could result from a combination of factors related to the choice of raw material, extraction conditions, potential degradation pathways, analytical method limitations, and the presence of interfering substances. Identifying and addressing these factors is critical for optimizing the extraction process and improving the yield and purity of galacturonic acid in pectin. Future work could focus on methodical experimentation with these variables to establish optimized conditions that align better with the quality standards for pectin."},{"prompt":"extraction was done via microwave with deionised water","completion":"Given the extraction of pectin was performed using microwave assistance with deionized water as the solvent, several specific considerations arise that could explain the observed low galacturonic acid content in the extracted pectin. Let's delve deeper into how these conditions might influence the outcome: # Impact of Microwave-Assisted Extraction with Deionized Water 1. **Non-Optimal Extraction Parameters** - **Temperature Control**: Microwave-assisted extraction rapidly increases the temperature of the solvent and matrix, potentially leading to overheating of the sample. Without precise temperature control, this might result in the thermal degradation of galacturonic acid chains within the pectin. - **Uneven Heating**: Microwaves can cause uneven heating in the sample mixture, which might lead to localized areas where the pectin is either under-extracted (leaving high-molecular-weight pectin with more galacturonic acid content unextracted) or over-degraded. 2. **Solvent Effectiveness** - **Solubility Issues**: Deionized water has a high polarity and might not effectively solubilize pectin, particularly if the plant material requires rupturing of strong cell walls for pectin release. The solubility of pectin in water can be influenced by its degree of esterification; low-ester pectins are more soluble in water than high-ester pectins, potentially leading to selective extraction that favors the former, which generally have lower galacturonic acid content. - **Hydrolysis**: Deionized water might also promote hydrolysis of the ester bonds in pectin during the extraction process, leading to a breakdown of pectin chains and a reduction in the measurable galacturonic acid as intact pectin molecules. 3. **Lack of Optimization for Microwave Parameters** - **Power and Time**: The microwave power level and extraction time are critical factors. Insufficient power or too short extraction times might lead to incomplete extraction of pectin, while excessive power or prolonged extraction can degrade pectin. Finding the balance is key, and it appears that, in this case, the parameters used might not have been optimal for preserving galacturonic acid integrity. 4. **Purity and Composition of the Extract** - **Contaminants from Raw Material**: Deionized water is less effective than solvents that might include acids or chelating agents at selectively extracting pectin without also solubilizing other cell wall components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. This could lead to a less pure extract, in which the actual content of galacturonic acid is diluted by other components. - **Incomplete Separation**: Without additional steps to purify the extract, such as alcohol precipitation, filtration, or dialysis, the final product might contain a mix of desired and undesired molecules, affecting the overall yield of galacturonic acid in the sample prepared for HPLC analysis. # Recommendations for Improvement To address these issues and potentially increase the galacturonic acid content in the extracted pectin, several adjustments can be considered: - **Parameter Optimization**: Systematically vary the microwave power and extraction time to find the conditions that maximize galacturonic acid yield without degrading the pectin. - **Use of Acidified Water**: A slight acidification of the water might help break down plant cell walls more effectively and stabilize the galacturonic acid against degradation. - **Sequential Extractions**: Performing multiple rounds of extraction, adjusting the conditions each time based on the characteristics of the extract obtained in the previous round, could increase the yield. - **Purification Steps**: Introduce steps to purify the extract before analysis, such as dialysis or solvent precipitation, to concentrate the pectin and remove compounds that could interfere with the HPLC analysis. Addressing these considerations could lead to a more effective extraction process that yields pectin with a higher galacturonic acid content, aligning more closely with JECFA requirements and enhancing its functional properties for industrial applications."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cette application, sous l'apparence d'un jeu de réalité augmentée axé sur le bien-être et la santé, propose des défis quotidiens encourageant ses utilisateurs à consommer différentes herbes naturelles et suppléments sous prétexte de renforcer leur bien-être général. Marion réussit à convaincre Sacha et Nadia de télécharger l'application sous le prétexte d'améliorer leur contenu lié à la santé et au bien-être sur les réseaux sociaux. Les \\"défis santé\\" que l'application propose spécifiquement à Sacha et Nadia incluent l'ingestion de tisanes et de compléments alimentaires tout à fait bénins, mais qui, selon l'univers fictif de cette histoire, sont mélangés de façon à altérer légèrement et temporairement leur capacité à contrôler leur vessie. Cette modification est présentée comme réversible, avec l'idée qu'une fois conscientes de l'impact réel de leur défi, Sacha et Nadia pourront suivre un autre schéma de défis dans l'application conçu pour inversement restaurer leur condition. Bien entendu, tout cela se déroule dans un contexte d'histoire fictive, où les possibilités sont infinies et ne sont limitées que par notre imagination. Dans cette réalité alternative, Marion ne cherchait pas à nuire de manière irréversible mais voulait enseigner une leçon d'empathie et de conscience en utilisant ses compétences uniques en informatique et sa connaissance des produits naturels.

The 4am classics lineup is replaced with The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Other than that, the night schedule is more or less the same, swamped with blocks of Skatoony, The Garfield Show and KikoRiki. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Garfield Show 4:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers It's no surprise that Doraemon hasn't been given a warmer welcome on Boomerang, and to the United Kingdom as well. As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co.

This show premiered on Boomerang UK and was taken off the schedule for unknown reasons after a short run. It seemed like the show was gone for good, with no signs of it returning. However, in a twist of fate, \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" made a triumphant return to the Boomerang UK schedule in early 2013. It was given a new time slot in the early mornings, replacing Doraemon, which had also been removed from the schedule. This move was unexpected, as it seemed like the show had been written off completely. Fans of \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" were thrilled to see the show back on the air, even if it was in a limited capacity. It was a pleasant surprise to see a show that had been seemingly forgotten about suddenly reappear and regain a spot in the programming lineup. It goes to show that sometimes, shows can make a comeback despite initial setbacks. So, if you were a fan of \\"The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers\\" and thought you would never see it again after it disappeared in late 2011, don't lose hope. Sometimes, shows can surprise us with a vengence and make a comeback against all odds."},{"prompt":"비쥬얼 스튜디오 2022 버전에서 사용된 컴파일러를 알려줘","completion":"Visual Studio 2022에서는 여러 언어로 프로그램을 개발할 수 있지만, 가장 주목받는 언어 중 하나인 C++에 대한 컴파일러로 MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler)를 사용합니다.

The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update.

Write a blog post about the state of the night lineup, and it has been this way since September, and recount how it was like before then","completion":"The night lineup on Boomerang UK has been consistent for a few months now, with Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show, and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers dominating the schedule. This lineup has been in place since September, and while it offers a variety of shows for viewers to enjoy, some may be wondering if it's time for a change. Before this lineup took hold, Boomerang was known for being a late-night home for CN's former programming. Shows like Gadget Boy, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Robotboy, and Teen Titans Go all found a spot on the schedule at one point or another. However, the current lineup seems to be lacking in variety and could benefit from some fresh programming. With the recent changes in the schedule, such as the removal of Doraemon, LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo, and Pink Panther and Pals, viewers may be missing some of the classic shows that used to air on Boomerang. While new episodes of The Garfield Show and Scooby-Doo and Guess Who are great additions, it might be time to shake things up and bring back some fan-favorite shows that have been absent from the lineup. As we move into the new year, it will be interesting to see if Boomerang UK makes any further changes to the night lineup. With new episodes of shows like Tom and Jerry in New York and Chaotic joining the schedule, there may be more surprises in store for viewers.

The Imperial Room—reserved for those of noble heritage—housed a curious scene: Silvia and Est, their forms nestled intimately against Ash’s slumbering body. Unbeknownst to him, the night’s chill had called for shared warmth, a gesture as innocent as it was natural. Est sighed contentedly, her presence akin to a protective charm, while Silvia was torn between decorum and the allure of closeness. As the rays of the morning light pirouetted through the room, Ash remained adrift in dreams, undisturbed by the gentle embrace of his makeshift guardians. Across the campus, in the Spartan confines of the Kaganovitch quarters, Cid slipped into his chamber. The Shadow Clone, a clever ruse used to uphold his guise as an average student and dutiful son, dissipated into the ether, leaving behind the well-rested form of a clandestine revolutionary. Yatta, yūjinā taikai ni chikazuite iru, he mused with satisfaction. (I’ve done it, approaching the grand assembly of dimensions.) His eyes glinted with a reflection of the forsaken NATO base, where relics of Earth’s ingenuity lay dormant, awaiting reclamation. A brisk shower washed away the remnants of the night, and as droplets of water skittered across his skin, Cid contemplated the riddles of Linda and Ash. The disruption of natural order—the binding of a human as a Pal—was a conundrum that demanded his keen intellect. Harnessing the drive that fuelled his Zero exploits, he resolved to unravel this mystery, his deduction fortified by the wealth of knowledge gained within academia’s gilded walls. With a day brimming with possibility and intrigue ahead, he set forth with determination to acquire answers discreetly, his actions as fluid as the subtle turn of espionage’s gears. The world of Tristain—a place where the ancient and new collided, and where mechanical marvels coursed with the essence of magic—throbbed with the lifeblood of change. From the might of the British Empire’s legacy to the austere grandeur of the Romanov’s Russia, from the martial prowess of the Bulgarian Tsardom to the dignified resilience of Bourbon France, the confluence of history and innovation created a tapestry rich with potential. Here, where the politics of high fantasy wrestled with the shadows cast by darkened figures in Cyber’s early dawn, identities were not merely worn but wielded like weapons in a silent struggle for power and sovereignty. Cid, no stranger to such battles, readied himself for the day as Ash, unknowingly caught in his own web of destiny, stirred. Yet, with the warmth of companionship gracing his waking moments, the discord of morning’s mystery unfolded like a palimpsest waiting for ink to scribe its secrets upon the world. In this place, where the storied past met the pulsing future, through halls imbued with the influence of legends and rings of power, the narrative of these intertwined lives pressed onward—a story of intricate alliance and concealed truths that would shake the foundations of their very reality. [First version of the prototype chapter ends here] Chapter 3: Weaving Threads of Night As the moon paraded across the velvety sky, casting its gentle glow through the windows, the Academy held its breath in the deep quietude of night. In one chamber, Silvia and Est, bound by a shared affection and duty, watched over Ash as he slept, blissfully unaware of his admirers’ silent vigil. With a tender smile, they eventually yielded to slumber, content in their roles as guardians and companions. Silvia (thinking, with a soft resolve): Il a tellement de responsabilités… Nous sommes là pour partager le poids de ses devoirs. (He carries so many responsibilities… We are here to share the weight of his duties.) Est (thinking, protective and devoted): Magister meus, somnus tuus pacem habet sub custodia nostra. (My master, your sleep holds peace under our guard.) Meanwhile, Cid quietly returned to his dormitory, his frame still humming with the night’s exploits. Dispersing his shadow clone with a silent incantation, he absorbed its rest, feeling refreshed as if having slumbered for hours. Cid (thinking): Kage bunshin no jutsu wa yoi kyūsoku o motarashita. Mata tsugi no sakusen e. (影分身の術は良い休息をもたらした。また次の作戦へ。) (The shadow clone technique has yielded good rest. On to the next operation.) The recent discovery of an abandoned base, one seemingly linked to Earth’s NATO forces, beckoned him with its mystery. The remnant technology, a call from a world he once knew, ignited a fire within him to unearth its secrets. [Second version of the Prototype chapter ends here] [Third version of the prototype chapter starts here] Chapter Three: Whispers of Dawn As dawn’s first light poured over the horizon and into the room shared by Ash, Silvia, and Est, the morning held the remnants of a serenity unique to those early hours. Ash, still wrapped in slumber’s embrace, was blissfully unaware of the tender, protective care he received from both Silvia and Est as they quietly attended to his well-being. With the care one might give to a cherished companion, the duo ensured his comfort, whispering hushed words of encouragement for the day that lay ahead. Their gestures were a quiet testimony of their different, yet profound connections to him—unspoken and sacred in the quiet morning space. On the other end of the academy, Cid ghosted back into his dorm room after a night spent patrolling the shadows as Zero. His return was seamless as he dispelled the crafted illusion—a shadow clone that had served as his proxy, resting in his stead. “Naruhodo, fukugen suru no wa, hayai ja nai ka,” he mused contentedly, appreciating the reinvigoration he felt from the rested doppelganger. (“Indeed, recovery is faster than expected,” he mused contentedly, appreciating the reinvigoration he felt from the rested doppelganger.) Pleased with his recent discovery—an untouched base nestled deep within the nearby forests, possibly linked to an Earth where NATO once reigned—Cid planned his next moves. The abandoned base, with its defunct dimensional travel equipment, piqued his relentless curiosity. “Это может быть из того мира. Я должен исследовать это,” he resolved, setting aside his Zero armor with methodical care. (“It might be from that world. I must investigate it,” he resolved, setting aside his Zero armor with methodical care.) Showering away the remnants of the night, Cid pondered the puzzling situation that had unfolded at the academy—Linda, seemingly a human, bound as a Pal to another human, Ash. The notion violated every understanding of the rule that only dragons could form such bonds. “Tabun, ryū tachi mo ningen no sugata ni naru koto ga dekiru…” he theorized, considering the implications as he prepared for the day. (“Perhaps, dragons can also take on a human form…” he theorized, considering the implications as he prepared for the day.) As the academy stirred to life, Ash woke to his day’s routines, his thoughts a quiet reflection of the peace of his accommodations. “Kono heya wa, odayakana,” he thought, a sense of gratitude for the tranquil morning. (“This room is peaceful,” he thought, a sense of gratitude for the tranquil morning.) Meanwhile, Linda carried an unsettled mix of emotions—a natural cycle infusing her with an energy that was both a boon and a burden, ever fluctuating and demanding. “Pourquoi cela doit-il être si compliqué?” she pondered, conflicted by her own nature and needs. (“Why does this have to be so complicated?” she pondered, conflicted by her own nature and needs.) Fianna, or Nina, as she was known at the academy, practiced her drills in the early light, her thoughts never far from the mysterious bond between Ash and Linda. “Ash-san to Linda-san no kankei wa, fukuzatsudesu ne,” she thought, her curiosity never quite sated. (“The relationship between Ash and Linda is complicated, isn’t it,” she thought, her curiosity never quite sated.) As the students began their daily symphony of learning and duties, the undercurrents of their true selves continued to shape the paths they walked—whether draped in mystery, driven by duty, or laden with emotions unvoiced. For each, the day would unfurl with secrets held close and roles dutifully played within the stone walls of Tristain Academy of Magic. — [Third version of the Prototype chapter ends here]","completion":"Chapter One: Veil of Dawn and Shadows As the veil of night lifted, dawn's first light bathed the sprawling academy, a nexus where the ingenious weave of clockwork melded with the essence of rising steam. Within the grandeur of the Imperial Room—reserved for those of noble lineage—Silvia and Est found sanctuary wrapped in an embrace around Ash's slumbering form. The chill of the night had ushered them closer, an action born of necessity and unspoken bonds. Est, tranquil and protective, exhaled softly, her aura akin to a guardian’s embrace, while Silvia battled an internal war between the dictates of decorum and the compelling need for closeness. Morning rays, in their dance, found the trio in repose, an image of tranquility amidst the stirring academy. Elsewhere, within the austere confines of his quarters, Cid emerged from the shadows, the illusion of his Shadow Clone dissipating—a cloak he wore to navigate the dualities of his life. A silent reflection glistened in his eyes, remnants of a night spent skirting the fringes of mysteries that spanned dimensions. The harmonious interplay of water cascading over him served as a cleanse, not just of grime but of contemplations laid bare in solitude. Musings of Linda, a human anomalously bound as a Pal—a quandary that tickled his intellect, and Ash, unwittingly entwined in the web of fate, danced in his thoughts. The city of Tristain, where ancient magics and burgeoning technologies entwined, hummed with life, a testament to the confluence of empires and innovations. Herein lay a world where political machinations of high fantasy interlaced with the emergent shadows of cyberpunk’s dawn, every identity a blade sheathed in ambition. As Cid stepped forth, clad in the day's guise, Ash found awakening amidst the warmth of his guardians, the tranquility of the morning whispering of mysteries ensconced in the pulsating heart of the academy. The narrative of their intertwined destinies—a tapestry woven from the threads of concealed truths and silent alliances—cast its first stitches against the backdrop of a world teetering on the edge of monumental change. Here, in the belly of Tristain, where history’s resonance met the pulse of the future, their saga unfolded. In the gentle embrace of dawn, Silvia and Est, guardians by choice, whispered promises to the day, their silent vigil a harbinger of unwritten tales. Meanwhile, Cid, fresh from the shadows’ embrace, mulled over revelations veiled within the night, his path intersecting the enigma of dimensions untold. The hallowed grounds of the academy became a crucible for lives interlocked by fate, each bearing the weight of their roles—a story of community spellbound by intrigue and the unseen chains of destiny. As the day unfurled, so too did the layers of mystery enveloping each soul, each step forward a thread in the intricate weave of an epic spanning worlds and unraveling the very fabric of reality. In the interplay of light and shadow, the students of Tristain Academy stood at the nexus of an unprecedented journey—a convergence of paths that would redefine the boundaries of their existence."},{"prompt":"перефразируй Выполненные работы оценивают по трехбалльной системе: «удовлетворительно», «хорошо» и «отлично».

For each, the day would unfurl with secrets held close and roles dutifully played within the stone walls of Tristain Academy of Magic. — [Third version of the Prototype chapter ends here]","completion":"Melding the Essence: Chapter One - Whispers and Shadows of Dawn As the first light of dawn embraced the sprawling campus of the Tristain Academy of Magic, a bastion where the marvels of clockwork and steam-powered technology intertwined with ancient magic, a scene of quiet companionship unfolded within the Imperial Room. Silvia and Est, bound by a shared affection and a solemn duty, lay close to Ash, their forms a testament to the night's necessity for shared warmth. Unbeknownst to him, their presence provided comfort and protection, a silent vigil over his peaceful slumber. In another part of the academy, the spartan chamber of Cid Kaganovitch bore witness to his return from the shadows. Dispersing his Shadow Clone—a clever guise that allowed him to navigate his dual life—he mused on his latest discovery, an abandoned base that whispered of Earth's past might and secrets waiting to be unlocked. Across the vast grounds, in the quiet of their own spaces, characters from various dimensions stirred. Linda wrestled with her unique situation, an anomaly in the magical order that tied her to Ash in a bond unheard of. Fianna, known as Nina within these hallowed halls, practiced her early drills, her mind wandering to the intricate web of relations that enveloped her companions. As the day broke, roles were quietly assumed, masks donned with practiced ease. Within the academy's ancient walls, where clockwork gears met the whispers of magic, each character embarked on their own quest for knowledge, power, and understanding. Cid, carrying the aura of a clandestine revolutionary, planned his exploration of the forsaken NATO base, its relic technology a beacon for his insatiable curiosity. His thoughts lingered on the day ahead, filled with the promise of discovery and the intriguing puzzle of Linda and Ash's bond—a challenge to the natural order that demanded his attention. Meanwhile, Ash, roused from his dreams by the comforting presence of Silvia and Est, faced the day with a sense of serenity, unaware of the secrets and conspiracies that swirled around him. His connection with both Silvia and Est, though unspoken, was profound, their guardianship a silent vow to protect and support. The ancient and the modern collided at Tristain, a melting pot of high fantasy and dark urban intrigue, where mechanical marvels breathed life into stone walls and whispered promises of power. Here, the disparate threads of their lives wove together, forming a narrative of complex alliances and hidden truths. As the academy stirred to life, students and faculty alike navigated the thin line between reality and deception, their true selves masked beneath layers of duty and ambition. In this world of clockwork shadows and magical light, each moment held the potential for revelation or ruin. Thus, the day began at Tristain Academy, a place where legends walked among mortals, and where the fabric of reality was ever at the mercy of those daring enough to reshape it. Each character, a protagonist in their own right, stepped forward into the unfolding story, their fates intertwined within the academy's enchanted walls."},{"prompt":"Boomerang UK listings September 2012 1) Mr Bean replaces the Animated Series with the Live-Action Series, which premiered in August. The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update.

It is on in the early mornings, replacing Doraemon, which is being removed from the schedule. - And finally, to which many will call the sad part of the update. Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley, Top Cat, Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics and The Flintstones will be removed. The 4am classics lineup is replaced with The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Other than that, the night schedule is more or less the same, swamped with blocks of Skatoony, The Garfield Show and KikoRiki. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Garfield Show 4:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers It's no surprise that Doraemon hasn't been given a warmer welcome on Boomerang, and to the United Kingdom as well. As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co. Guess that owl is finally getting the pedestal he deserves. Glad to see it back, Hope they do the same for Doraemon EDIT: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is NOT leaving the schedule, but it is being reduced to only a double bill at 4:00. The Owl and Co replaces it's other slots December has no schedule changes, other than new episodes of Tom and Jerry in New York at 5pm, only other change is at Christmas, when the Christmas specials of verious shows air January highlights on Boomerang UK: - New episodes of The Garfield Show continue to air throughout the month - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who gets a special marathon event on weekends - The Owl and Co continues to air in its new time slots - Ben 10 has a special marathon event to celebrate the show’s anniversary - Skatoony and KikoRiki continue to dominate the late-night schedule - The Flintstones return for a special throwback marathon event on weekends - Regular Show makes a surprise return to the daytime schedule, replacing Tom and Jerry in New York - Stay tuned for more updates and exciting programming on Boomerang UK! 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Ben 10 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - Regular Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Feburary Highlights on Boomerang UK Chaotic is new, replacing Ben 10 in all slots, Regular Show is also gone, replaced with more Garfield Show 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Chaotic 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Chaotic 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - Chaotic 18:30 - The Flintstones 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Stay tuned for more changes and new programming updates on Boomerang UK!

假设 ML_Process 函数定义如下: def ML_Process(features, targets): # 在这里使用 features (特征数据) 和 targets (目标变量) 来训练模型 model = SomeMachineLearningModel() model.train(features, targets) return model # 调用 ML_Process 函数进行模型训练 model = ML_Process(df_ML, targets) \`\`\` 如果 \`x\` 实际上是指的设置或者某种配置，那么应该在模型初始化或者模型训练的时候传递这些设置。为了具体回答您的问题，我需要明确 \`ML_Process\` 函数的定义和它期望的参数类型。如果 \`ML_Process\` 是负责模型训练的，通常情况下，您需要传递特征数据和目标变量（如上面的简化例子所示）。"},{"prompt":"import pandas as pd import tsfresh import os import json import scapy import numpy as np import warnings from timeit import default_timer as timer from scapy.all import * warnings.filterwarnings(\\"ignore\\") #ignore warnings caused by #

1. 创建新数据点的DataFrame 假设您有一个新的观测值，格式和信息类似于提供的示例： \`\`\`python import pandas as pd data = {\\"Time\\": [1554121408.226434], \\"Source\\": [\\"192.168.1.149\\"], \\"Destination\\": [\\"216.73.182.119\\"], \\"Protocol\\": [\\"TLSv1.2\\"], \\"Length\\": [112], \\"Hw_src\\": [\\"b4:6d:83:77:8b:9d\\"], \\"HW_dst\\": [\\"216.73.182.119\\"]} # 创建这个新观测值的DataFrame new_df = pd.DataFrame(data) \`\`\` # 2. 数据预处理和特征提取 根据您的机器学习流程，如果需要特征提取（例如，从原始数据生成新特征），您应当对这个新的DataFrame执行相应操作。然而，基于您提供的流程，假设预处理仅涉及存在的列数据，而不需要额外生成新特征。 注意：在实际应用中，如果训练数据经过特殊处理（比如特征缩放、编码、或基于条件的特征生成等），新数据也需要相同的处理。 # 3. 特征选择 只保留训练模型时用到的特征。假设基于原来的\`run_process\`函数，重要的特征是\`\\"Time\\"\`和\`\\"Length\\"\`（只是假设，请按照实际使用的特征来处理）： \`\`\`python # 假设训练模型时使用了 \\"Time\\" 和 \\"Length\\" 作为特征 new_df_processed = new_df[[\\"Time\\", \\"Length\\"]] \`\`\` # 4. 执行模型预测 前面的步骤都是为了准备数据，假设\`voting_clf\`是您已经训练好的模型： \`\`\`python # 假设 voting_clf 已经被训练好了 predictions = voting_clf.predict(new_df_processed) \`\`\` 这将给出基于模型\`voting_clf\`对这个新观测值的预测结果。 # 注意 实际应用中，重要的是确保: - 数据的预处理方式与训练集完全一致。 - 模型训练时使用的特征也应该对新数据使用。 如果\`voting_clf\`模型依赖于除了\`\\"Time\\"\`和\`\\"Length\\"\`之外的其他特征进行训练，您需要确保新创建的\`new_df_processed\` DataFrame也包含这些相同的特征，并且它们已经过相应的预处理。 此外，根据您提供的代码，您可能还需要对新数据执行标签编码（如果在模型训练过程中应用了）。由于\`new_df_processed\`仅包含数值特征（根据上述假设），这里没有显示这一步。如果您的模型依赖于分类特征，请确保这些特征也经过了相同的预处理步骤。"},{"prompt":"ValueError: X has 2 features, but LogisticRegression is expecting 211 features as input. 不行，报这个错误","completion":"此错误表明您尝试使用的新观测值在预处理（特别是特征选择）步骤中可能未正确执行。错误信息提示模型期望的输入特征是211个，但您提供的数据仅含有2个特征。这表明在训练模型时使用的数据集和您尝试进行预测的数据集在特征数量上不匹配。 要解决这个问题，请确保以下步骤被正确执行： # 1. 特征一致性 确保新数据的特征集与训练数据完全一致。这不仅仅意味着保留相同的列，也意味着执行任何特征工程的步骤（如果在训练阶段有的话），如特征提取、特征构造等。 # 2. 特征提取 如果您的模型依赖于通过\`tsfresh\`库从原始数据中提取出来的特征，那么在对新数据进行预测之前，您也需要对新数据执行相同的特征提取流程。这包括使用相同的参数运行\`tsfresh.extract_features\`函数，以及仅保留训练模型时确定为重要且选择保留的特征。 # 3. 特征选择 在提取特征后，确保仅使用模型训练时识别为重要的特征。这可能由于在您的示例中，对新数据缺少相应的特征选择步骤，导致特征数不匹配。如果您从新数据中提取了多于或少于211个特征，则需要调整以匹配模型期望的特征数量。 # 示例调整过程 假设您已经有了一个特征列表\`selected_features\`（这包含了在模型训练过程中被选中的211个特征的名字），您需要确保新数据同样只包含这些特征： \`\`\`python # 假设 selected_features 是训练时选择的特征列表 new_df_processed = extract_features(new_df, ...) # 使用 tsfresh 的特征提取函数 new_df_selected = new_df_processed[selected_features] # 确保只选中训练时使用的特征 \`\`\` # 4. 预测 经过上述步骤处理后，您的数据将具有与训练模型时相同数量的特征，于是可以执行预测： \`\`\`python predictions = voting_clf.predict(new_df_selected) \`\`\` 请确保\`selected_features\`正确地包含了训练阶段确定的所有特征，并且\`extract_features\`正确应用于新数据。如果您没有保存\`selected_features\`列表，将需要从训练代码中重新生成它。"},{"prompt":"import pandas as pd import tsfresh import os import json import scapy import numpy as np import warnings from timeit import default_timer as timer warnings.filterwarnings(\\"ignore\\") #ignore warnings caused by #

为新数据应用\`tsfresh\`特征提取 当处理新数据以供预测时，重要的一步是确保新数据经过与训练数据相同的预处理步骤。在您的案例中，您需要从新数据中提取特征，然后应用训练阶段确定的特征选择。具体如何执行这一步骤取决于您处置数据和训练模型的确切方式。由于您提到了\`column_kind='Is_malicious'\`，这表明特征提取时依赖于这个列。然而，新数据不会有这个列，因为我们尚未对其进行分类。以下是您可以执行的一些步骤： # 步骤解释 1. **特征提取**: 对于使用\`tsfresh\`特征提取，若某些特殊参数（如\`column_kind\`）被用于区分不同类型的时间序列或特征，则您需要相应调整特征提取过程，确保它可以在没有明确分类标签的情况下应用于新数据。 2. **模拟\`column_kind\`**: 如果原始特征提取过程中使用\`column_kind\`来区分不同类别的数据点，而这种区分对于特征提取至关重要，则您可能需要为新数据构造临时的\`column_kind\`。既然新数据没有\`Is_malicious\`这一列，您可以简单地为整个新数据集添加这个列，赋予一个默认值，例如0（表示“非恶意”），仅为了通过特征提取过程。 #

1. 特征提取 由于新数据没有\`Is_malicious\`标签来区分恶意和良性流量，如果特征提取过程依赖于这个区分，你需要以另一种方式处理。对新数据来说，假设所有新数据都属于同一类型（因为此时我们还不知道它们是恶意的还是良性的），可以以同样的方式处理所有数据。 在提取特征时，直接略过\`column_kind\`参数，或给所有数据赋予一个统一的临时标签（如果\`tsfresh\`要求必须有这个参数）。 # 2. 使用训练阶段确定的最佳特征 从训练数据中提取的最佳特征列表（\`best_features\`列表）应该应用于新数据上，以确保特征的一致性。训练完成后保存这个列表很重要，因为它确定了模型训练所依赖的确切特征子集。 假设你已经有了\`best_features\`列表，那么对新数据提取完特征后，仅保留这个列表中的特征： \`\`\`python # 假设 new_data_extracted_features 代表新数据提取的特征 DataFrame new_data_selected_features = new_data_extracted_features[best_features] \`\`\` #

We initiated this by contrasting the standard DDQN approach with a variation devoid of the meta-learning phase. In this variant, the policy network pi_{theta,theta'} underwent no meta-training and was instead initialized randomly, bypassing any form of refinement or tuning. This comparison aimed to evaluate the intrinsic value of meta-learning to the DDQN's ability to select optimal algorithms. Furthermore, we investigated the DDQN's performance when learning from comprehensive learning curve trajectories against its performance when only the final evaluation points of these curves were considered. Specifically, in the latter scenario, an agent's decision omega_j led to the retrieval of only the last data point from the pre-computed learning curve mathcal{L}_{ij}^{train,val}, alongside a mandatory cost Delta_j applicable to the agent. The results from these comparisons unequivocally demonstrate that both the inclusion of meta-learning and the comprehensive consideration of learning curve trajectories are pivotal for the DDQN's superior performance.

It's obvious that there's not much to worry about with this product.\\" Actual production for the month was 17,500 units. Variable overhead cost is assigned to products on the basis of direct labor-hours. There were no beginning or ending inventories of materials. 3. How much of the 0.64 excess unit cost is traceable to apparent inefficient use of labor time?","completion":"To calculate the amount of the 0.64 excess unit cost that is traceable to the apparent inefficient use of labor time, we need to compare the standard direct labor cost with the actual direct labor cost per unit. Standard direct labor cost per unit is calculated as: 1.10 hours at 16.00 per hour = 17.60 Actual direct labor cost per unit is calculated as: 1.15 hours at 15.40 per hour = 17.71 The excess direct labor cost per unit due to labor inefficiency (usage variance) is the difference in the actual hours worked compared to the standard hours allowed, multiplied by the standard rate. However, in this case, we are focusing on the cost aspect directly: Direct labor cost variance (Actual - Standard): 17.71 - 17.60 = 0.11 Therefore, of the 0.64 total excess unit cost, 0.11 is traceable to the apparent inefficient use of labor time."},{"prompt":"labor efficiency variance","completion":"Labor efficiency variance specifically looks at how efficiently labor time is used, comparing the standard labor time expected to produce an item versus the actual labor time used.

Given data: Standard labor quantity: 1.10 hours per unit Standard labor rate: 16.00 per hour Actual labor quantity: 1.15 hours per unit Actual Units produced: 17,500 units To calculate the labor efficiency variance, we compare the standard labor hours for the actual production to the actual labor hours used, and then multiply the difference by the standard labor rate. First, calculate the total standard labor hours for actual production: Standard hours = Standard labor quantity per unit * Actual units produced = 1.10 hours/unit * 17,500 units = 19,250 hours Then, calculate the total actual labor hours used: Actual hours = Actual labor quantity per unit * Actual units produced = 1.15 hours/unit * 17,500 units = 20,125 hours Now, calculate the variance: Labor efficiency variance = (Total standard hours - Total actual hours) * Standard rate = (19,250 hours - 20,125 hours) * 16.00 per hour = (-875 hours) * 16.00 per hour = -14,000 A negative labor efficiency variance of 14,000 indicates that there was more time spent on production than was standard, costing the company an additional 14,000 due to inefficient use of labor time.

Bill Gates, con su enfoque práctico y basado en datos para resolver problemas, probablemente buscaría primero definir qué significa exactamente ser la \\"primera fuerza mundial\\" en este contexto. Si nos referimos a economía, innovación, salud, tecnología o educación, cada área tiene sus propios indicadores de liderazgo. 1. **Datos y Evidencia**: La primera cuestión sería examinar los datos actuales que apoyen esta afirmación. ¿En qué sectores específicos España está marcando una diferencia significativa a nivel global? Gates seguramente buscaría evidencia tangible de crecimiento y potencial, como el PIB, la inversión en I+D, la calidad del sistema educativo, el estado del sistema de salud, y la presencia de empresas tecnológicas innovadoras. 2. **Innovación y Tecnología**: Considerando la importancia que Gates concede a la innovación tecnológica como motor de cambio y desarrollo, evaluaría cómo España se está posicionando en el ámbito de la tecnología. ¿Hay un ecosistema de startups en crecimiento, apoyo a la investigación y desarrollo, y una fuerte colaboración entre universidades, el sector privado y el gobierno? La posición de liderazgo en el futuro podría depender en gran medida de la innovación tecnológica y de cómo se aprovecha la inteligencia artificial, la energía renovable y otras tecnologías emergentes. 3. **Educación**: Dado el énfasis de Gates en la educación, analizaría cómo el sistema educativo en España se está preparando para enfrentar los retos del futuro. ¿Está fomentando el pensamiento crítico, las habilidades en STEM (ciencia, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas) y adaptando sus currículos a las necesidades del siglo XXI? 4. **Salud y Desarrollo Sostenible**: Otro aspecto sería el compromiso de España con la salud global y el desarrollo sostenible. ¿Cómo está abordando los problemas de salud pública y participando en iniciativas globales? ¿Está liderando en soluciones para el cambio climático, la energía limpia y la sostenibilidad? 5. **Colaboración Internacional**: Finalmente, Gates probablemente destacaría la importancia de la colaboración internacional para ser un líder mundial. No solo se trata de la fuerza y el liderazgo dentro de un país, sino también de cómo ese país se relaciona y contribuye al bienestar global. ¿Está España desempeñando un papel activo en la solución de problemas globales y en la creación de alianzas internacionales? En conclusión, aunque el entusiasmo por el potencial de España es admirable, desde una perspectiva analítica basada en resultados y datos, sería esencial tener en cuenta estos factores y evaluar objetivamente el progreso y los retos en cada área. El liderazgo mundial es multifacético y requiere innovación sostenida, compromiso con la educación de calidad, inversión en salud, colaboración internacional y, lo más importante, la voluntad de adaptarse y enfrentar los desafíos globales emergentes."},{"prompt":"Voy a darte mi opinión sobre algo y quiero que la critiques como si fueras Bill Gates","completion":"Entiendo que te gustaría recibir una crítica basada en cómo podrías imaginar que Bill Gates proporcionaría su punto de vista.

La compagnie est particulièrement connue pour ses adaptations animées de classiques littéraires et de contes populaires. Ces films étaient souvent destinés à être diffusés à la télévision ou disponibles directement en vidéo, ce qui les rendait accessibles à un large public familial sans nécessiter une sortie cinématographique. Fondée par Tim Brooke-Hunt en 1981, Burbank Films Australia a profité de l'époque où la production de films d'animation connaissait une croissance significative grâce aux progrès technologiques et à l'augmentation de la demande de contenu animé pour la télévision et le marché de la vidéo. Parmi ses nombreuses productions, on trouve des adaptations de classiques tels que \\"Le Conte de deux villes\\", \\"Oliver Twist\\", \\"Le Livre de la jungle\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", et \\"Le Magicien d'Oz\\". Ces films étaient appréciés pour leur capacité à rendre des histoires classiques accessibles aux enfants, tout en offrant des divertissements de qualité pour toute la famille. Burbank Films Australia avait pour stratégie de produire des films d'animation à faible coût mais de qualité respectable, ce qui leur permettait de concurrencer sur le marché international. La société a joué un rôle important dans l'industrie de l'animation australienne pendant sa période d'opération, bien que son rayonnement ait été principalement international en raison de l'exportation de ses films dans de nombreux pays. Malgré son succès, Burbank Films Australia a cessé ses activités à la fin des années 1980. Néanmoins, l'héritage de la compagnie perdure à travers ses films, qui continuent d'être découverts par de nouvelles générations de spectateurs à travers le monde.

Il s'agit d'une des nombreuses adaptations cinématographiques basées sur le célèbre roman \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" de Lewis Carroll, un classique de la littérature enfantine anglaise. Voici la fiche technique et quelques détails de cette adaptation par Burbank Films Australia : **Titre :** Alice au Pays des Merveilles (Alice in Wonderland) **Année de production :** 1988 **Durée :** Le film a une durée approximative de 50 minutes, ce qui est typique pour les productions de Burbank Films Australia destinées à la télévision ou au marché vidéo direct. **Société de production :** Burbank Films Australia **Réalisateur :** Le film a été produit sous la direction de différents réalisateurs au fil des années chez Burbank Films, mais l'information spécifique concernant le réalisateur de \\"Alice au Pays des Merveilles\\" peut varier selon les sources. Burbank ne mentionnait pas toujours les réalisateurs de manière prominente dans leurs crédits. **Scénario :** L'adaptation scripturale cherche souvent à rester fidèle au matériel source tout en le rendant accessible au jeune public. Le film suit généralement les péripéties d'Alice, une jeune fille curieuse qui tombe dans un terrier de lapin et se retrouve dans un monde fantastique peuplé de personnages bizarres et merveilleux. **Musique :** Les productions de Burbank Films Australia incluaient souvent des musiques originales ou adaptées conçues pour compléter l'atmosphère et les thèmes du film. **Distribution :** Les films d'animation de Burbank étaient produits en anglais, mais nombreux ont été doublés dans d'autres langues pour leur diffusion internationale. **Animation :** L'animation de Burbank Films Australia à cette époque était traditionnelle, utilisant des techniques d'animation celluloïd. Le style visuel était adapté pour correspondre à l'esthétique du conte tout en restant dans les limites du budget de production. **Synopsis :** Après avoir suivi un lapin pressé, Alice entre dans le Pays des Merveilles, un monde où la logique normale ne s'applique pas. Dans ce monde, elle rencontre des personnages tels que le Chapelier Fou, la Chenille, le Chat du Cheshire, et la Reine de Cœur. L'histoire suit les aventures extraordinaires d'Alice dans ce monde onirique et son voyage de découverte personnelle et d'imagination. \\"Alice au Pays des Merveilles\\" de Burbank Films Australia est un exemple de leur travail d'adaptation de classiques littéraires en longs métrages d'animation.

Cependant, il est important de noter que Burbank Films Australia avait pour habitude d'engager des acteurs de voix talentueux, principalement d'origine australienne, pour donner vie à ses personnages. Ces acteurs apportaient une dimension supplémentaire à l'animation grâce à leur interprétation vocale, enrichissant ainsi l'expérience du spectateur.

This model focuses on the \\"community\\" as the primary method for promoting personal change. Within a therapeutic community, residents are actively involved in their own and each other's treatment, participating in a range of activities designed to enhance social and personal skills in a structured, supportive setting. Key characteristics of therapeutic communities include: 1. **Living as a Community**: Residents live together, often for an extended period, ranging from several months to over a year. This immersive experience is designed to help individuals learn to function in a social context, practice healthy interactions, and build a supportive network. 2. **Shared Responsibility**: The responsibility for the daily operations and maintenance of the community is shared among all members. This shared responsibility helps foster a sense of belonging, accountability, and cooperation. 3. **Hierarchical Structure with Phases**: Therapeutic communities typically have a hierarchical structure with different phases that residents progress through. As individuals move through these phases, they are granted more responsibilities and privileges, reflecting their personal growth and recovery progress. 4. **Focus on the Whole Person**: The treatment model addresses not just the substance abuse or behavioral issue but the whole person. It aims to change patterns of behavior, attitudes, and values, focusing on developing personal accountability and responsibility. 5. **Group Sessions and Activities**: Therapeutic communities utilize group therapy sessions, workshops, and various communal activities as primary methods for treatment and education. This approach helps individuals confront their behaviors and attitudes, learn new coping strategies, and build a network of support. 6. **Integration of Clinical Services**: While the community itself is a key therapeutic agent, many TCs also integrate various clinical services, including individual counseling, mental health services, and medical care, to address the complex needs of the residents. Therapeutic communities have been found effective for a variety of populations, including adults, adolescents, homeless individuals, and prison inmates, among others. The underlying belief of the TC model is that lasting change occurs through a gradual process of social and psychological growth, facilitated by the community's structure and support."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The timeslots stay at 6:30 and 16:00, but gets an additional slot at 19:00. EDIT: There is No Bean in the mornings. Instead, Tom & Jerry Tales will air at 6:30. 2) Tom & Jerry will be replaced with Tom & Jerry Tales at 17:30 and 20:00. The old shorts will air at 8:00 and 14:30. 3) New Episodes of Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated continue airing at 7:30 and 17:00 4) Casper's Scare School also continues its new series at 16:30, but gets its evening slot replaced with Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated at 19:30. I surprised the series carried on making new episodes, cause the show was off the air for a long period. 5) My Spy Family and My Knight and Me get removed from Boomerang (aired since 2007 and 2009 respectively), and gets replaced by Skatoony and KikoRiki. This has been an ongoing trend for Boomerang being a late-night secondary home for CN's former programming. First they had Gadget Boy, then they gave The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers another chance after its CN premier wasn't permanent, and then shortly Robotboy aired for a few months. Teen Titans Go aired at one point this time last year. Now, They've added Skatoony and KikoRiki, which both air after one and other and also air on CN Too, Skatoony is some quiz show where kids battle cartoon characters to win a prize (Almost always a games console), KikoRiki is a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals in a similar vein to Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!, Wouldn't it make sense to air some Boomerang related shows, or any CN show they no longer air? 6) Regular Show is removed, replaced with Ben 10 And changes occur, i will update.

It is on in the early mornings, replacing Doraemon, which is being removed from the schedule. - And finally, to which many will call the sad part of the update. Wacky Races, Dastardly & Muttley, Top Cat, Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics and The Flintstones will be removed. The 4am classics lineup is replaced with The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, Other than that, the night schedule is more or less the same, swamped with blocks of Skatoony, The Garfield Show and KikoRiki. 6:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 6:30 - Tom & Jerry Tales 7:00 - The Garfield Show 7:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 8:00 - Tom & Jerry 8:30 - The Looney Tunes Show 9:00 - The Land Before Time 9:30 - The Tom and Jerry Show 10:00 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 10:30 - LazyTown 11:00 - Grizzy and the Lemmings 11:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 12:00 - The Garfield Show 12:30 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Scooby Doo, Where are You! 13:30 - Scooby Doo and Guess Who 14:00 - Pink Panther and Pals 14:30 - Tom & Jerry 15:00 - What's New Scooby-Doo? 15:30 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Mr Bean 16:30 - Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu 17:00 - Scooby Doo Mystery Incoporated 17:30 - Looney Tunes Cartoons 18:00 - The Looney Tunes Show Wednesday - Boomerang Cinema 18:30 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - Mr Bean 19:30 - Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 20:00 - Ben 10 20:30 - KikoRiki 21:00 - The Garfield Show 21:30 - The Garfield Show 22:00 - Skatoony 22:30 - Skatoony 23:00 - KikoRiki 23:30 - KikoRiki 0:00 - The Garfield Show 0:20 - The Garfield Show 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - The Garfield Show 3:25 - The Garfield Show 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:05 - The Garfield Show 4:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:30 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 5:45 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers It's no surprise that Doraemon hasn't been given a warmer welcome on Boomerang, and to the United Kingdom as well. As mentioned in the earlier posts, the show will be gone completely, and is being replaced with The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers. As those who weren't aware, the show premiered around the middle of July, airing only one slot a day (07:30). A new episode would air on Weekdays, followed by a repeat on Weekends. But this clearly isn't enough for a new show to broadcast. It could be that the show was at a bad time to broadcast when children/families wouldn't be awake at around 07:30/08:30 to tune in this show. And anyone who was keen to watch it probably couldn't due to poor timing, or the lack or any technology to record and catch up on the show (i.e Sky+, Tivo, etc). But the show's exclusion is a bit odd for Boomerang, It's a shame that they didn't seem to give the show a proper chance to air Many other shows went through this problem in the past. Already brought up before was the half-season run of Tiny Toon Adventures, and the popular series My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic being lost to POP!/Tiny Pop. Also leaving Boomerang is The Jungle Bunch: To The Rescue. This premiered last autumn, and later moved to late-nights in June. It has been mentioned (not official) that only Season 1 has been airing, and it's 2nd season may not be bought Turner after all. A similar fate may have been the cause for The Owl & Co, which started in October 2011, running only on weekends, and lasted only until mid-December before disappearing completely from schedule, and no trace of any comeback. November sees a MAJOR change to the schedule. - All airings of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated are being replaced with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who, Ben 10 joins the daytime schedule, like how it airs over on Cartoon Network and CN Too - It looks as though Casper's Scare School and Doraemon show no sign of ever returning, much like how Teen Titans Go felt in September 2011, when it only aired at NIGHT for 3 weeks before it was off for good. - LazyTown, What's New Scooby-Doo and Pink Panther and Pals are being taken off the schedule, replaced by The Garfield Show, Scooby-Doo, Ben 10 and Scooby Doo & Guess Who - The night schedule is getting a bit repetitive by this point, The schedule is still Skatoony, KikoRiki, The Garfield Show and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers - The Owl and Co is back, having not aired since late 2011 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo 10:00 - Scooby-Doo 11:00 - The Garfield Show 13:00 - Ben 10 14:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 16:30 - The Owl and Co 17:00 - Tom and Jerry in New York 17:30 - The Garfield Show 18:00 - Ben 10 19:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 19:30 The Owl and Co 20:00 Ben 10 A change is coming to the night schedule, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is being removed and replaced with The Owl and Co. Guess that owl is finally getting the pedestal he deserves. Glad to see it back, Hope they do the same for Doraemon EDIT: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers is NOT leaving the schedule, but it is being reduced to only a double bill at 4:00. The Owl and Co replaces it's other slots December has no schedule changes, other than new episodes of Tom and Jerry in New York at 5pm, only other change is at Christmas, when the Christmas specials of verious shows air January highlights on Boomerang UK: - New episodes of The Garfield Show continue to air throughout the month - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who gets a special marathon event on weekends - The Owl and Co continues to air in its new time slots - Ben 10 has a special marathon event to celebrate the show’s anniversary - Skatoony and KikoRiki continue to dominate the late-night schedule - The Flintstones return for a special throwback marathon event on weekends - Regular Show makes a surprise return to the daytime schedule, replacing Tom and Jerry in New York - Stay tuned for more updates and exciting programming on Boomerang UK! 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Ben 10 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Ben 10 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - Regular Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - The Garfield Show 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Feburary Highlights on Boomerang UK Chaotic is new, replacing Ben 10 in all slots, Regular Show is also gone, replaced with more Garfield Show 6:00 - The Garfield Show 7:00 - The Garfield Show 8:00 - Chaotic 9:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 10:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 11:00 - The Garfield Show 12:00 - Chaotic 13:00 - The Owl and Co 14:00 - The Garfield Show 15:00 - The Garfield Show 16:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales 17:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 18:00 - Chaotic 18:30 - The Flintstones 19:00 - The Flintstones 20:00 - Scooby-Doo and Guess Who 21:00 - Skatoony 22:00 - KikoRiki 23:00 - The Garfield Show 0:00 - KikoRiki 0:20 - Skatoony 0:40 - The Garfield Show 1:00 - The Garfield Show 1:30 - KikoRiki 1:50 - KikoRiki 2:15 - Skatoony 2:40 - The Garfield Show 3:05 - KikoRiki 3:25 - KikoRiki 3:45 - The Garfield Show 4:00 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:15 - The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 4:30 - The Owl and Co 4:45 - The Owl and Co 5:00 - The Owl and Co 5:15 - The Owl and Co 5:30 - The Owl and Co 5:45 - The Owl and Co Stay tuned for more changes and new programming updates on Boomerang UK!

I love both of those shows and it would be so cool to see the worlds of The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends collide in some way. Boomerang should definitely consider doing a crossover event or maybe even just a themed programming block that celebrates Craig McCracken's creations. User3: I totally agree! Craig McCracken is such a talented creator and it would be a great way to honor his work by showcasing both of these iconic shows together. Boomerang has been known to do special events and marathons, so I think it's a possibility. Maybe they could even have some behind-the-scenes content or interviews with the creators to give fans an extra treat. User1: That would be awesome, User3! I hope Boomerang is listening to our ideas and considers linking The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends in some way. It would be a dream come true for fans of both shows.

Эта ошибка может возникать по разным причинам, но основными из них, учитывая ваш контекст использования функции \`VirtualProtectEx\`, могут быть: 1. **Недостаточно прав доступа при открытии процесса.** Для изменения атрибутов защиты памяти у вас должны быть соответствующие права на процесс, к которому вы пытаетесь получить доступ. Убедитесь, что при открытии дескриптора процесса с помощью \`OpenProcess\` вы запрашиваете \`PROCESS_VM_OPERATION | PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_VM_WRITE\`, а также \`PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION\` может быть полезен.

В противном случае операционная система заблокирует попытку изменения из соображений безопасности. Решение: - Убедитесь, что ваше приложение запущено с правами администратора. Это можно сделать, кликнув правой кнопкой мыши по исполняемому файлу и выбрав \\"Запустить от имени администратора\\", или же настроив манифест приложения для запрашивания административных прав. - Проверьте, правильно ли вы передаёте \`PID\` и адрес для изменения в \`VirtualProtectEx\`. Возможно, ошибка в вызове \`OpenProcess\` или в расчёте адреса.

Возможно стоит переписать приложение с использованием MmProtectMdlSystemAddress?","completion":"Использование функции \`MmProtectMdlSystemAddress\` подразумевает работу на уровне драйвера в режиме ядра (kernel mode) операционной системы Windows. Это совершенно иная область, как с точки зрения разработки, так и с точки зрения рисков и ответственности. Работа с кодом режима ядра требует глубоких знаний архитектуры Windows, а также опыта в разработке драйверов. Это также связано с высокими рисками для стабильности системы и безопасности, поскольку неправильно написанный драйвер может привести к сбоям системы (BSOD) и другим проблемам. Переписывать приложение для работы на уровне ядра осмысленно только в случае, если нет других способов достижения нужного результата в пользовательском режиме и если задача действительно требует такого уровня доступа. Операции, такие как изменение атрибутов защиты памяти процесса, в большинстве случаев, могут быть успешно выполнены из пользовательского режима с правильными разрешениями и аккуратной обработкой ошибок. Если проблема состоит в изменении атрибутов защиты памяти конкретного процесса и \`VirtualProtectEx\` не работает из-за ограничений доступа или из-за специфики целевой области памяти, рекомендую пересмотреть следующие моменты: 1. **Повышение прав приложения.** Убедитесь, что ваше приложение или обработчик драйвера действительно запускается с правами администратора, если это необходимо для изменения атрибутов защиты памяти. 2. **Проверка альтернативных методов.** Вместо перехода к разработке в режиме ядра, рассмотрите возможность использования других подходов к обходу проблемы, например, исследуйте, не поможет ли работа с отдельными страницами памяти через \`VirtualQueryEx\` и \`VirtualProtectEx\` в комбинации с анализом атрибутов памяти процесса. 3. **Работа с разрешениями и политиками Windows.** Иногда проблемы с доступом могут быть связаны с политиками безопасности Windows, UAC (User Account Control) или с особенностями работы определённых служб и аппаратных функций. Переход к решениям на уровне ядра следует рассматривать с осторожностью и только при наличии соответствующего опыта. Если задача требует именно такого подхода, рекомендую начать с изучения официальной документации Microsoft по разработке драйверов, а также рассмотреть возможность консультации с экспертами в данной области. Для подробной консультации или разработки драйверов и работы с системными вызовами в режиме ядра обратитесь к специализированной литературе и ресурсам по разработке драйверов Windows."},{"prompt":"реализуй MmProtectMdlSystemAddress. вот код моего драйвера: #include <ntifs.h> extern \\"C\\" { NTKERNELAPI NTSTATUS IoCreateDriver(PUNICODE_STRING DriverName, PDRIVER_INITIALIZE InitializationFunction); NTKERNELAPI NTSTATUS MmCopyVirtualMemory(PEPROCESS SourceProcess, PVOID SourceAddress, PEPROCESS TargetProcess, PVOID TargetAddress, SIZE_T BufferSize, KPROCESSOR_MODE PreviousMode, PSIZE_T ReturnSize); } void debug_print(PCSTR text) { #ifndef DEBUG UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(text); #endif // DEBUG KdPrintEx((DPFLTR_IHVDRIVER_ID, DPFLTR_INFO_LEVEL, text)); } namespace driver { namespace codes { // Used to setup the driver. constexpr ULONG attach = CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x696, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_SPECIAL_ACCESS); // Read process memory. constexpr ULONG read = CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x697, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_SPECIAL_ACCESS); // Write process memory. constexpr ULONG write = CTL_CODE(FILE_DEVICE_UNKNOWN, 0x698, METHOD_BUFFERED, FILE_SPECIAL_ACCESS); } // namespace codes // Shares between user mode & kernel mode. struct Request { HANDLE process_id; PVOID target; PVOID buffer; SIZE_T size; SIZE_T return_size; }; NTSTATUS create(PDEVICE_OBJECT device_object, PIRP irp) { UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(device_object); IoCompleteRequest(irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT); return irp->IoStatus.Status; } NTSTATUS close(PDEVICE_OBJECT device_object, PIRP irp) { UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(device_object); IoCompleteRequest(irp, IO_NO_INCREMENT); return irp->IoStatus.Status; } NTSTATUS device_control(PDEVICE_OBJECT device_object, PIRP irp) { UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(device_object); debug_print(\\"[+] Device control called.n\\"); NTSTATUS status = STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL; // We need this to determine with code passed through.

Из-за этого её непосредственное использование вызывает затруднения, так как она не доступна для стандартных драйверов. Вместо этого будем рассматривать возможность изменения защиты страниц памяти процесса средствами, доступными в официальной документации Windows Driver Kit (WDK). Во-первых, важно осознавать, что операции с памятью, на уровне изменения атрибутов защиты, в ядре Windows осуществляются через MDL (Memory Descriptor List). MDL позволяют драйверам описывать и манипулировать физическими страницами памяти в виртуальном адресном пространстве процесса. Для изменения защиты страницы используется \`MmProtectMdlSystemAddress\`. Однако, если вашей основной целью является единственно изменение атрибутов защиты памяти процесса (например, для записи), то рекомендуется использовать следующий подход с \`MmSecureVirtualMemory\`. Имейте в виду, что ваш текущий драйвер уже содержит основную функциональность для чтения и записи памяти процесса через \`MmCopyVirtualMemory\`, которая является подходящим способом работы с памятью процессов в драйверах. Чтобы обновить ваше приложение и драйвер, вы должны убедиться, что они корректно используют права доступа и контекст выполнения для изменения защиты памяти. Однако, без явного доступа к \`MmProtectMdlSystemAddress\` или похожим неэкспортируемым функциям ядра, прямого способа реализовать функциональность \`MmProtectMdlSystemAddress\` в пользовательском драйвере нет. # Обновление приложения Часть с приложением представлена корректно для взаимодействия с вашим драйвером. Чтобы работа с драйвером могла осуществлять изменения атрибутов защиты страниц, драйвер должен предоставлять такую возможность через свои IOCTL вызовы, что потребует дополнительных изменений в ядре драйвера. В вашем случае, можно было бы добавить новый код IOCTL, который бы сообщал драйверу о необходимости изменения атрибутов защиты для указанного региона памяти. # Заключение К сожалению, без использования не экспортируемых функций ядра или без изменения дизайна драйвера для решения конкретной задачи через доступные API, невозможно прямо реализовать \`MmProtectMdlSystemAddress\` или аналогичную функциональность. Ваш текущий подход с \`MmCopyVirtualMemory\` для чтения/записи уже является рекомендуемым методом работы с памятью других процессов на уровне драйверов в Windows."},{"prompt":"Как используя мой подход через MmCopyVirtualMemory изменить права доступа на запись в процесс?","completion":"Использование функции \`MmCopyVirtualMemory\` в вашем драйвере даёт возможность читать и записывать память других процессов, но не предоставляет прямой возможность изменения атрибутов защиты страниц памяти (таких как права на запись). Функция \`MmCopyVirtualMemory\` сама по себе не изменяет атрибуты защиты памяти; она просто копирует данные между адресными пространствами двух процессов в соответствии с текущими правами доступа. Чтобы изменить права доступа к памяти процесса на запись, необходимо использовать другие методы. В контексте разработки драйверов на уровне ядра, можно было бы воспользоваться таким подходом, как работа с таблицами страниц напрямую или использование MDL (Memory Descriptor List) для временного изменения атрибутов доступа к памяти. Однако, эти операции требуют глубоких знаний о внутреннем устройстве Windows и могут нести риски для системной стабильности. # Альтернативный подход, который можно использовать: Один из безопасных методов — использование функции \`VirtualProtectEx\` в пользовательском пространстве для изменения защиты памяти процесса, но это требует, чтобы изменяемый процесс запускал код, выполняющий вызов \`VirtualProtectEx\`. В драйвере такая задача может быть реализована через инъекцию кода или запрос на выполнение определённой операции изменения атрибутов страницы памяти из самого процесса. # Обратите внимание: - Прямое изменение атрибутов защиты памяти других процессов из драйвера является высокорискованной операцией и может нарушить стабильность работы системы. - Изменение прав доступа к памяти других процессов без использования официально предоставляемых Windows API (например, через \`VirtualProtectEx\`) может нарушать политику безопасности Windows и вызывать проблемы с совместимостью и стабильностью. # В заключение: Для выполнения вашей задачи без рисков и нарушений политик безопасности Windows, рассмотрите варианты работы внутри контекста целевого процесса, возможно, через инъекцию DLL или другие техники для запуска кода, способного изменить защиту памяти через API, предоставляемые операционной системой."},{"prompt":"VirtualProtectEx не помог","completion":"Если использование \`VirtualProtectEx\` напрямую в контексте целевого процесса (например, через инъекцию кода) не решает вашу задачу по изменению прав доступа на запись, этот случай может быть связан с несколькими проблемами, такими как ограниченные права процесса, наличие защит механизмов в самом процессе, или ошибки в использовании функции \`VirtualProtectEx\`. В таком случае, для решения задачи на уровне драйвера, подход должен быть пересмотрен: 1. **Работа с таблицами страниц напрямую:** - Это подразумевает изменение физических атрибутов страниц, что потенциально возможно, но требует глубокого понимания архитектуры и внутреннего устройства процессов Windows, а также может привести к нестабильности работы системы. 2. **Использование обходных путей:** - Вместо попыток изменить атрибуты защиты страницы можно попытаться найти обходное решение. Например, если задача состоит в модификации определенных данных в памяти процесса другой программой, возможно, будет более целесообразно использовать механизмы межпроцессного взаимодействия (IPC) для запуска в целевом процессе кода, который сам изменит необходимые данные с учетом уже имеющихся прав. 3. **Отладочные интерфейсы:** - Для специфических случаев, например, в целях отладки, можно использовать отладочные интерфейсы Windows для управления процессами и их памятью. Конечно, этот подход ориентирован на разработку и отладку, а не на продуктивное использование в рабочих приложениях. # Важное замечание: Модификация памяти других процессов без явного разрешения и осознанной необходимости может нарушать принципы безопасности и стабильности, а также привести к нежелательным последствиям в работе программ. Всегда старайтесь найти способы решения задачи, которые вписываются в стандартные и рекомендованные рамки. Исходя из описанного вами сценария, если \`VirtualProtectEx\` и прямые операции с памятью не приводят к успеху, возможно, следует переосмыслить саму задачу и искать альтернативные способы достижения целей, такие как изменение архитектуры приложения, использование соглашений между приложениями или организация работы через высокоуровневые API, предусмотренные операционной системой."},{"prompt":"Через Cheat Engine найденная область bodyblock_bytes изменяется лишь брейкпоинтом на операцию \\"mov eax, 1\\" и последующее изменение этой операции на \\"mov eax, 0\\". Как это решить через нашу программу?","completion":"Чтобы внести подобные изменения в программе наподобие того, как это делается через Cheat Engine с помощью установки брейкпоинта на операцию и изменения инструкции с \`mov eax, 1\` на \`mov eax, 0\`, вам необходимо прочитать память целевого процесса, модифицировать её и записать обратно. Это стандартная операция для многих инструментов и скриптов, автоматизирующих читинг или модификацию поведения игр и приложений. **Шаги для изменения:** 1. **Определение адреса изменяемой инструкции:** - Ваш код уже должен уметь находить требуемую последовательность байтов (\`bodyblock_bytes\`) в памяти процесса. Указатель/адрес этой области — это именно то место, где расположена операция \`mov eax, 1\`. 2. **Модификация найденного значения:** - Вы должны изменить найденный фрагмент байтов так, чтобы инструкция \`mov eax, 1\` стала \`mov eax, 0\`. В двоичном виде x86-инструкция для \`mov eax, 1\`, в зависимости от контекста и оптимизаций, может отличаться, но самый простой способ — найти область, которую Cheat Engine идентифицирует как изменяемую, и заменить соответствующие байты. 3. **Запись изменений:** - После модификации нужно записать измененную последовательность обратно в память целевого процесса на то же самое место, откуда она была прочитана. Заметьте, вы уже реализовали функции чтения и записи памяти для драйвера (\`read_memory\` и \`write_memory\`). Следовательно, используя найденный адрес, вы сможете изменить инструкцию напрямую через эти функции. **Важный момент при изменении исполняемого кода:** Перед записью изменённых данных обратно в память процесса, потребуется изменить права доступа к этой области памяти, чтобы разрешить запись. В пользовательском пространстве это делается через вызов \`VirtualProtectEx\`, как вы уже пытались сделать. Если после ваших предыдущих попыток это не получилось, стоит убедиться, что вы явно указываете правильный тип доступа и корректно восстанавливаете исходное состояние после модификации. Эта операция осуществляется с дескриптором процесса и правильным обращением к VirtualProtectEx, как уже было упомянуто: \`\`\`cpp DWORD oldProtect; VirtualProtectEx(hProcess, reinterpret_cast<LPVOID>(address), size, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &oldProtect); // Внесение изменений ... // Восстановление оригинальных прав доступа VirtualProtectEx(hProcess, reinterpret_cast<LPVOID>(address), size, oldProtect, nullptr); \`\`\` Используйте найденный адрес \`found_user_ini_address\` или подобный, чтобы изменить инструкцию через вашу функцию \`write_memory\`. Не забывайте, что изменение исполняемого кода программ может вызывать непредвиденные последствия, включая сбои в работе программа и ухудшение стабильности системы. Используйте такие вмешательства с осторожностью и только в рамках законных и этичных границ."},{"prompt":"Selamlar, SOSYAL MEDYANIN TÜKETİCİ DAVRANIŞLARI ÜZERİNDEKİ ROLÜ üzerine bir araştırma önersi yazdım. Şimdi ise bir tez hazırlamalıyım. Sana araştırma önerimden ve tezimin hangi başlıklardan olışacağını anlatacağım. Senden bana yardımcı olmanı istiyorum. Aşağıdaki bilgiler yola çıkarak tezimi hazırla. Araştırma Önerim şu şekilde -> \\" Giriş ve Teorik Çerçeve Günümüzde, dijitalleşme ve teknolojik ilerlemelerle birlikte sosyal medya, bireyler arası iletişimde ve bilgi alışverişinde önemli bir araç haline gelmiştir. Sosyal medyanın bu hızlı yayılışı, tüketici davranışlarını etkileme potansiyeliyle birlikte, akademik çevrelerde de önemli bir araştırma alanı olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Bu bağlamda, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki rolünü anlamak, pazarlama stratejilerini geliştirmek ve işletmelerin rekabet avantajı elde etmelerine yardımcı olmak için kritik bir öneme sahiptir. Sosyal medya, tüketicilerin bilgi arama, ürün değerlendirme, satın alma kararı, marka sadakati ve satın alma sonrası davranışlar gibi farklı aşamalarda etkili olan bir platform haline gelmiştir (1). Problem İfadesi Sosyal medya, tüketicilerin satın alma kararlarını önemli ölçüde etkileyen bir platform haline gelmiştir. Sosyal medyada paylaşılan ürün yorumları ve tavsiyelerinin tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisi, sosyal, psikolojik ve kültürel faktörlerle değişkenlik göstermektedir. Bu faktörlerin neler olduğu ve nasıl ölçülebileceği konusunda literatürde, sınırlı sayıda çalışma bulunmakta (2) ve bu çalışmaların çoğu da tek bir sosyal medya platformu, tüketici davranışı türü veya örneklem grubu üzerinde odaklanmaktadır. (3,4) Ayrıca, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki rolünün, işletmelerin pazarlama stratejileri ve rekabet gücü üzerindeki etkileri de henüz tam olarak anlaşılamamıştır. Bu nedenle, bu araştırma, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki rolünü, hem tüketici hem de iş dünyası perspektifinden incelemeyi amaçlamaktadır. Araştırmanın Amacı Bu çalışmanın amacı, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki rolünü anlamayı ve bu etkilerin işletmelerin pazarlama stratejileri ve rekabet gücü üzerindeki etkilerini değerlendirmeyi amaçlamaktadır. Sosyal medyanın tüketici karar süreçlerine olan etkilerini belirli bir sektör, demografik grup veya coğrafi bölge bağlamında sınırlayarak, daha spesifik bir anlayış elde etmeyi hedeflemektedir. Bu genel amaç doğrultusunda, araştırmanın özel amaçları şunlardır: 1- Sosyal Medyanın Tüketici Davranışları Üzerindeki Etkilerini Belirlemek: Çalışma, sosyal medyanın tüketici karar süreçleri üzerindeki etkilerini analiz ederek, bu etkilerin ne şekilde ortaya çıktığını anlamayı hedeflemektedir. 2- İşletmeler İçin Rekabet Avantajlarını Ortaya Koymak: Sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkilerinin işletmelerin pazarlama stratejileri ve rekabet gücü üzerindeki etkilerini belirleyerek, işletmelere rekabet avantajları sağlama potansiyelini ortaya koymak. Literatür Taraması Sosyal Medyanın Y Kuşağı Satın Alma Davranışları Üzerindeki Etkisi: Bir Literatür İncelemesi (Yılmaz ve Çelik, 2020) Bu çalışma, Y kuşağının satın alma davranışları üzerinde sosyal medyanın etkilerini ele alarak, bu neslin tüketici karar süreçlerindeki rolünü aydınlatmaktadır. Y kuşağının sosyal medyayı nasıl kullandığını, sosyal medyanın Y kuşağının ürün ve marka bilgisini, algısını, tutumunu, güvenini, memnuniyetini, sadakatini, tavsiye ve şikayet davranışlarını, satın alma niyetini ve davranışını nasıl etkilediğini, sosyal medya pazarlamasının Y kuşağının satın alma davranışları üzerindeki etkisini ve en uygun stratejilerini literatür taraması yaparak incelenmiştir. Sosyal medya ve Y kuşağı arasındaki ilişkinin daha iyi anlaşılması için, farklı sosyal medya platformlarının, farklı ürün ve hizmet kategorilerinin, farklı kültürel ve coğrafi faktörlerin ve farklı sosyal medya pazarlama stratejilerinin etkilerinin daha ayrıntılı olarak araştırılması gerektiği önerilmiştir. Social Media Marketing Strategy: Definition, Conceptualization, Taxonomy, Validation, and Future Agenda (Li, Larimo ve Leonidou, 2021) Bu çalışma, sosyal medya pazarlama stratejilerini tanımlamak ve kavramlaştırmak amacıyla kapsamlı bir çerçeve sunarak, sosyal medyanın işletmelerin pazarlama stratejileri üzerindeki rolünü derinlemesine incelemektedir. Sosyal medya pazarlama stratejisi, işletmelerin sosyal medya platformlarını kullanarak tüketicilerle etkileşim kurma, onlara değer sunma ve onları satın alma kararlarına yönlendirme şeklidir. Li, Larimo ve Leonidou (2021), sosyal medya pazarlama stratejisini dört boyutlu bir kavram olarak tanımlamış ve sınıflandırmışlardır. Bu boyutlar, sosyal medya platformu seçimi, sosyal medya içerik yönetimi, sosyal medya ilişki yönetimi ve sosyal medya performans ölçümüdür. Bu boyutlar, işletmelerin sosyal medya pazarlama stratejilerini planlama, uygulama ve değerlendirme aşamalarında rehberlik edebilir. Li, Larimo ve Leonidou (2021), sosyal medya pazarlama stratejisinin geçerliliğini, 15 farklı ülkeden 400’den fazla işletme üzerinde yaptıkları bir anket çalışmasıyla test etmişlerdir. Bulgular, sosyal medya pazarlama stratejisinin, tüketicilerin marka algısı, marka sadakati, satın alma niyeti ve satın alma davranışı gibi değişkenler üzerinde pozitif ve anlamlı bir etkiye sahip olduğunu göstermiştir. Li, Larimo ve Leonidou (2021), sosyal medya pazarlama stratejisi konusunda gelecek araştırmalar için, sosyal medya platformu seçiminin etkilerini, sosyal medya içerik yönetiminin farklı türlerini, sosyal medya ilişki yönetiminin boyutlarını ve sosyal medya performans ölçümünün kriterlerini daha ayrıntılı olarak incelemeyi önermişlerdir. Relationship between Social Media Marketing and Consumer Buying Behavior (Ather, Khan, Rehman, Nazneen, 2021) Sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketici satın alma davranışı üzerindeki etkisi konusunda yapılan bir çalışma, Pakistan'ın Peşaver şehrinde gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu çalışma, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketici satın alma davranışı üzerinde önemli bir pozitif ilişkiye sahip olduğunu bulmuştur. Ayrıca, sosyal medyanın işletmeler için tüketicilerle etkileşim kurmak için etkili bir araç olduğunu ortaya koymuştur. Çalışmanın bulguları, işletmeler ve pazarlama alanında çeşitli sonuçlar doğurmakta olup, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketici satın alma davranışındaki rolüne dair içgörü sağlamaktadır. Ayrıca, çalışma bulgularını desteklemek için regresyon analizi ve Pearson ürün moment korelasyon katsayısı kullanmıştır.

Sosyal Medyanın Tüketici Davranışları Üzerine Etkisinin Belirlenmesi (Keskin ve Baş, 2023) Bu çalışma, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerine etkisini belirlemek amacıyla Sivas ilinden sosyal medya kullanan tüketicilere anket uygulamıştır. Anket sonuçlarına göre, sosyal medyada ürünlerle ilgili konuşulan şeylerden tüketicilerin büyük bir kısmının etkilendiği, sosyal medyada ürün ve marka hakkında yapılan yorumların satın alma kararlarını etkilediği, sosyal medyada ürün ve marka hakkında yapılan paylaşımların ürün ve marka algısını etkilediği ve sosyal medyada ürün ve marka hakkında yapılan beğenilerin ürün ve marka sadakatini etkilediği bulunmuştur. Sosyal Medya Pazarlamasının Tüketici Satın Alma Davranışları Üzerine Etkisi (Altunyay, 2020) Bu çalışma, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketici satın alma davranışları üzerine etkisini belirlemek için Ankara ilinden sosyal medya kullanıcılarına anket uygulamıştır. Anket sonuçlarına göre, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketicilerin satın alma davranışlarını etkilediği, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketicilerin ürün ve marka bilgisini artırdığı, sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketicilerin ürün ve marka tutumunu olumlu yönde etkilediği ve sosyal medya pazarlamasının tüketicilerin ürün ve marka tercihini etkilediği bulunmuştur. Sosyal Medyanın Tüketici Davranışları Üzerindeki Rolü: Üniversite Öğrencileri Üzerine Bir Araştırma (Aksoğan, Türel, 2021) Gümüşhane Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Elektronik Dergisi'nin 2021 yılında yayımlanan bu makalede, sosyal medyanın tüketicilerin satın alma davranışlarını etkilediği ve işletmelerin sosyal medyayı ürün/hizmet tanıtımı ve reklam için yoğun şekilde kullandığı ortaya çıkmıştır. Ayrıca, araştırmada sosyal medya kullanımının tüketicilerin satın alma öncesi ve sonrası davranışları üzerinde anlamlı bir etkisi olduğu belirlenmiştir. Cinsiyete göre yapılan analizlerde ise, kadınların sosyal medya kullanımının satın alma öncesi ve sonrası davranışları üzerinde erkeklere göre daha fazla etkili olduğu görülmüştür. Bu bulgular, işletmelerin sosyal medyayı etkin bir şekilde kullanarak tüketicilerin satın alma davranışlarını etkileme stratejileri geliştirmelerine yardımcı olabilir. Sorular • Sosyal medya kullanımının tüketici satın alma kararları üzerindeki etkisi nedir? • Hangi sosyal medya platformları tüketicilerin satın alma kararlarını en çok etkiler? • Sosyal medya platformlarındaki ürün yorumları ve tavsiyeleri tüketici davranışlarını nasıl etkiler? • Sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisi işletmelerin pazarlama stratejilerini ve rekabet gücünü nasıl etkiler? • Hangi sosyal medya platformları tüketicilerin satın alma kararlarını en çok etkiler? • Sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisi demografik faktörlere (yaş, cinsiyet, eğitim seviyesi vb.) göre nasıl değişir? • Sosyal medya platformlarındaki hangi reklam türleri tüketicilerin satın alma kararlarını en çok etkiler? • Tüketicilerin sosyal medyada hangi tür ürünler hakkında daha fazla bilgi aradıkları ve bu bilgi arayışının satın alma kararlarını nasıl etkilediği nedir? Tasarım – Metotlar ve Prosedürler Bu araştırmada, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkilerini incelemek amacıyla anket yöntemini kullanmayı planlıyoruz. Anket, üniversite öğrencileri üzerinde sosyal medya kullanım alışkanlıklarını belirleyerek, bu alışkanlıkların tüketici davranışlarına olan etkisini anlamamıza yardımcı olacak. Her bir araştırma sorusunu yanıtlamak için şu metodolojik adımları atmayı düşünüyoruz: • Hangi sosyal medya platformları tüketicilerin satın alma kararlarını en çok etkiler? Bu soruyu yanıtlamak için, katılımcılara anketimizde kullandıkları sosyal medya platformlarını ve bu platformların satın alma kararlarını nasıl etkilediğini sormayı planlıyoruz. • Tüketiciler sosyal medyada hangi tür içeriklere daha fazla ilgi gösterirler ve bu içerikler satın alma kararlarını nasıl etkiler? Bu soruyu yanıtlamak için, katılımcılara anketimizde hangi tür içeriklere ilgi gösterdiklerini ve bu içeriklerin satın alma kararlarını nasıl etkilediğini sormayı planlıyoruz. Araştırmamızda, tüketicilerin sosyal medya kullanım alışkanlıkları, demografik özellikleri ve kişilik özellikleri gibi yanıltıcı değişkenlere dikkat edeceğiz. Bu değişkenleri kontrol etmek için, anketimizde bu faktörleri ölçen soruları ekleyeceğiz. Örneklem seçimi, yanıt oranları ve ölçüm hataları gibi potansiyel hata kaynaklarına dikkat edeceğiz. Bu hataları minimize etmek için, örnekleme yöntemimizi özenle seçecek, anketimizi kısa ve anlaşılır tutacak ve ölçüm hatalarını azaltmak için sorularımızı dikkatlice tasarlayacağız. Gençlerin sosyal medya kullanımını incelemek için gençlerden oluşan bir örneklem kullanmayı planlıyoruz. Bu örneklem, gençlerin sosyal medya kullanım alışkanlıklarını ve bu alışkanlıkların tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisini anlamamıza yardımcı olacak. Sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisini değerlendirmek için kullanılacak anket, daha önceki araştırmalardan ve analizlerden yararlanılarak geliştirilecek. Anketin güvenilirliği ve geçerliliği test edilecek. Kısıtlama ve Sınırlamalar Bu çalışmanın potansiyel zayıf yönleri, öncelikle örneklem seçimi ve yanıt oranlarına bağlıdır. Araştırma gençlerden oluşan bir örneklem üzerinde gerçekleştirileceği için sonuçların genel popülasyona genelleştirilmesi sınırlı olabilir. Ayrıca, anket yanıtlarının doğruluğu ve dürüstlüğü, kişi beyanlarının doğası gereği her zaman bir sorun olabilir, bu da içsel geçerliliğe tehdit oluşturabilir ve bu unsurları tamamen kaçınmak veya minimize etmek genellikle mümkün olmaz. Çalışmanın kapsamı, sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisini incelemekle sınırlıdır. Bu nedenle, diğer iletişim kanallarının tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkisini ele almayacağız. Ayrıca, belirli sosyal medya platformlarına odaklanacağımız için tüm platformları kapsamayacağız. Bu sınırlamalar, araştırmanın odaklanmasını sağlar ve yönetilebilir bir kapsam sunar. Sınırlamaların belirlenmesinin nedeni, araştırmanın kapsamını yönetilebilir tutmak ve spesifik araştırma sorularına odaklanmaktır. Araştırmanın Önemi Bu çalışma, dijital pazarlama ve tüketici davranışları alanındaki bilgiyi genişleterek sosyal medyanın tüketici davranışları üzerindeki etkiyi daha derinlemesine anlamamızı sağlar.

These seeds are known for their health benefits and are often used in drinks, desserts, and smoothies for their unique texture and nutritional properties. Here's how to soak basil seeds: 1. **Measure the Seeds**: Start by measuring the amount of basil seeds you need. Usually, a tablespoon of seeds is enough to add to a drink or a dessert, considering they swell up considerably. 2. **Rinse the Seeds**: It's a good idea to rinse the seeds first to remove any dirt or impurities. Place them in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water for a few seconds. 3. **Soak the Seeds**: Transfer the rinsed seeds to a bowl. Add three to four times the amount of water to seeds. For example, if you have 1 tablespoon of basil seeds, add about 3 to 4 tablespoons of water. Room temperature water is typically used, but you can also use cold water. Avoid hot water as it can negatively affect the texture of the seeds. 4. **Wait for the Seeds to Swell**: Leave the seeds to soak for about 15 to 30 minutes. The exact time can depend on the size of the seeds and the water temperature. You'll know they're ready when they've swelled up and have a gel-like coating, making them appear much larger than their original size. 5. **Stir Occasionally**: Giving the seeds a gentle stir a few times during the soaking process can help ensure that they soak evenly. 6. **Drain (Optional)**: Once the seeds have swollen up, you can choose to drain any excess water using a strainer. This step is optional, as in many recipes, the seeds are used with the gel-like coating and the water they've swelled in. 7. **Use the Swollen Seeds**: Now that the basil seeds have been soaked and are ready, you can add them to your recipe. They are a popular addition to lemonades, smoothies, falooda, yogurt, and various other drinks and desserts. 8. **Storage**: If you have soaked more basil seeds than you need, you can store the swollen seeds in the refrigerator for up to a week. Make sure to store them in an airtight container with some of the soaking liquid to keep them hydrated and fresh. Soaking basil seeds is straightforward, and these versatile seeds can add not only a unique texture but also a nutritional boost to your food and drinks."},{"prompt":"How to soak almond gum?","completion":"Almond gum, also known as badam pisin or almond resin, is a natural substance derived from the bark of almond trees. It's commonly used in various traditional remedies and recipes, especially in Indian cuisine, due to its health benefits, which include cooling the body, aiding in weight gain, and acting as a natural coolant. Soaking almond gum is simple, and here is a step-by-step guide on how to do it: # Ingredients - Almond gum (as required) - Water (for soaking) # Instructions 1. **Cleaning:** First, inspect the almond gum for any impurities or debris. Though it's generally clean, it's always a good practice to check. 2. **Quantity:** Decide on the amount of almond gum you need to use. Almond gum expands significantly after soaking, so a little goes a long way. A teaspoon of almond gum pieces is often enough to reach a sizable volume once soaked. 3. **Soaking:** Place the almond gum in a clean, large bowl. Add ample water to cover it completely, as the gum will expand. A good rule of thumb is to add water at a ratio of about 1:10, meaning for every part of almond gum, use ten parts water. 4. **Time:** Allow the almond gum to soak for at least 6 to 8 hours, or overnight. This duration gives the gum ample time to swell up and become jelly-like. The exact time can vary depending on the size of the pieces of almond gum. 5. **Checking:** After the soaking period, the almond gum should have absorbed water and expanded into a soft, jelly-like substance. If some pieces haven’t fully swelled, they may need more time to soak. You can add more water if the level has gone down significantly during soaking. 6. **Draining:** Once the almond gum has fully expanded and has a jelly-like consistency, carefully drain off any excess water. 7. **Use:** The swollen almond gum can now be used in your recipe. It's commonly added to desserts, drinks (like milkshakes or smoothies), and even some savory dishes to provide a unique texture and to reap its health benefits. # Tips - **Storage:** If you’re not using the soaked almond gum immediately, it can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for a couple of days. Make sure it's covered with a bit of water to prevent it from drying out. - **Ratio Adjustment:** The amount of water can be adjusted depending on the desired final consistency of the almond gum. More water will make it softer, while less water will keep it firmer. - **Health Benefits:** Almond gum is known for its hydrating properties and is often consumed in summer to naturally cool the body. However, as with any natural remedy, consumption should be in moderation. This simple process of soaking can be applied similarly to other edible gums. Soaked almond gum is a versatile ingredient, blending well into various dishes and enhancing them not just with its texture but also with its nutritional profile."},{"prompt":"Give me the amount of almond gum and water in teaspoon measurement","completion":"For using teaspoon measurements for soaking almond gum, you would typically use a smaller amount due to its significant expansion. Here's a guideline: # Ingredients - 1 teaspoon of almond gum pieces - Around 10 teaspoons of water (or enough to fully submerge the gum) # Instructions 1. **Place the Almond Gum**: Put 1 teaspoon of almond gum pieces into a clean bowl. These pieces are quite hard initially and will need sufficient water to soak and expand. 2. **Add Water**: Pour approximately 10 teaspoons of water over the almond gum pieces. The key is to ensure that the almond gum is fully submerged with enough water to accommodate its expansion as it soaks. If your bowl is small, you may need to adjust by adding a bit more water just to keep the gum pieces submerged as they swell. 3. **Soaking Time**: Allow the almond gum to soak for about 6 to 8 hours, or even overnight. This duration is sufficient for the gum to absorb water, swell, and transform into a jelly-like consistency. 4. **After Soaking**: Check the almond gum after the soaking period. It should have expanded into jelly-like blobs. If there's any excess water, you can drain it off before using the almond gum in your recipe. This measurement is perfect for trying out almond gum in single servings or small recipes. You might adjust the amount of water slightly depending on the size of the almond gum pieces or the desired consistency, but the 1:10 ratio of gum to water (by teaspoons in this case) is a good starting point for soaking."},{"prompt":"ffmpeg 将mp4转为ts的命令","completion":"将MP4视频文件转换为TS（Transport Stream）格式，可以使用FFmpeg软件，这是一个强大的命令行工具，用于处理各种视频和音频格式的转换。以下是命令行的基础用法： \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -i 输入文件.mp4 -c copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -f mpegts 输出文件.ts \`\`\` - \`-i 输入文件.mp4\`：这指定了要转换的输入文件，比如你的MP4文件。 - \`-c copy\`：这表示视频和音频的编解码器将被复制，而不进行重新编码。这样可以保持原有的质量，并加快转换过程。 - \`-bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb\`：这个比特流过滤器是必须的，用于将H.264码流从MP4模式转换为TS所需要的模式。如果你的视频不是H.264编码的，这个参数可能需要调整。 - \`-f mpegts\`：这指明了输出格式为MPEG-TS。 - \`输出文件.ts\`：这是转换后的文件路径和名称。 请注意，这个命令不对视频和音频进行重新编码，所以转换过程相对较快，同时保持了原始质量。如果你需要对视频或音频进行压缩或其他处理，可能需要额外的参数来指定编解码器及其选项。 例如，如果你想要重新编码视频为H.264并调整输出文件的大小或质量，你可以使用： \`\`\`bash ffmpeg -i 输入文件.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 -c:a copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -f mpegts 输出文件.ts \`\`\` - \`-c:v libx264\`：指定视频编解码器为libx264，用于H.264编码。 - \`-preset slow\`：指定编码预设。\`slow\`提供了一个在编码速度和压缩效率之间较好的平衡。你可以选择\`ultrafast\`、\`superfast\`、\`veryfast\`、\`faster\`、\`fast\`、\`medium\`、\`slow\`、\`slower\`或\`veryslow\`，随着预设趋于\`veryslow\`，编码会更慢，但压缩效率更高。 - \`-crf 22\`：指定输出视频的质量，CRF值范围从0到51，其中0是无损模式，23是默认值，51可能是最低质量。值越低，质量越高，文件大小越大。 - \`-c:a copy\`：指示音频流应该被复制而不重新编码。"},{"prompt":"Codec 'hevc' (173) is not supported by the bitstream filter 'h264_mp4toannexb'.

This process involves creating the Swift part to handle the specific native functions and creating the Dart part to communicate with the Swift code. I'll guide you through a simplified version of this process. For clarity, this example will focus primarily on starting and stopping discovery as well as selecting a printer. # Step 1: Create the Swift Platform Channel Handler In your iOS Flutter project, navigate to the \`ios/Runner\` directory. You should see an \`AppDelegate.swift\` file where you can set up a channel to communicate with Flutter. Firstly, you will need to modify \`AppDelegate.swift\` to register a platform channel: \`\`\`swift import UIKit import Flutter @UIApplicationMain @objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate { override func application( _ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? ) -> Bool { // Add this line to create a FlutterViewController let controller : FlutterViewController = window?.rootViewController as! FlutterViewController // Define the channel name let printerChannel = FlutterMethodChannel(name: \\"com.yourcompany/printer\\", binaryMessenger: controller.binaryMessenger) // Set up the method channel handler printerChannel.setMethodCallHandler({ [weak self] (call: FlutterMethodCall, result: @escaping FlutterResult) -> Void in // This method is called on the channel thread, perform async tasks here // Handle method calls switch call.method { case \\"startDiscovery\\": self?.startDiscovery(result: result) case \\"stopDiscovery\\": self?.stopDiscovery(result: result) /* Add more cases for other methods */ default: result(FlutterMethodNotImplemented) } }) GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self) // Existing line return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions) // Existing line } private func startDiscovery(result: FlutterResult) { // Implement the starting discovery logic here // You should replace this with the actual start logic from the DiscoveryViewController or adapt the logic accordingly result(\\"Discovery started\\") } private func stopDiscovery(result: FlutterResult) { // Implement the stopping discovery logic here // Replace or adapt logic accordingly result(\\"Discovery stopped\\") } } \`\`\` # Step 2: Call the Swift Methods from Flutter (Dart) In your Dart code (for example, in a button's onPressed), you would call the methods like this: \`\`\`dart import 'package:flutter/services.dart'; class PrinterService { static const MethodChannel _printerChannel = MethodChannel('com.yourcompany/printer'); static Future<String> startDiscovery() async { try { final String result = await _printerChannel.invokeMethod('startDiscovery'); print(result); return result; } on PlatformException catch (e) { return \\"Failed to start discovery: '{e.message}'.\\"; } } static Future<String> stopDiscovery() async { try { final String result = await _printerChannel.invokeMethod('stopDiscovery'); print(result); return result; } on PlatformException catch (e) { return \\"Failed to stop discovery: '{e.message}'.\\"; } } } \`\`\` You can then use \`PrinterService.startDiscovery()\` or \`PrinterService.stopDiscovery()\` in your Flutter widgets to communicate with the native Swift code. # Additional Tips - Make sure to test on an actual iOS device or simulator since platform channels are specific to the native side of the app. - Remember to handle permissions, if any are needed, for the functionalities you want to use (Bluetooth, for example). - For more complex logic or additional functionality beyond \`startDiscovery\` and \`stopDiscovery\`, expand the \`switch\` cases in the Swift method call handler and the Dart method calls accordingly. - Always perform thorough error handling both on the Dart and Swift sides to ensure a smooth user experience."},{"prompt":"Merge the following versions of the same prototype for a crossover fanfic between Seirei Gensouki, Code Geass, Dragonar Academy, the Eminence in Shadow, the Familiar of Zero, Bladedance of Elementalers, Unbreakable Machine Doll, Monster Girl Encyclopedia and Monster Girl Quest into a single narrative that combines the best aspects of both prototypes while sticking to the setting of a clockpunk-based, dark urban high fantasy, heavily magic-using world with a good amount of steampunk and dieselpunk technology and some very early cyberpunk influence: Prototype Chapter 1: Chapter Thirteen: The Unveiling of a Master Amidst the clatter of fencing foils and the shuffling of eager feet, the academy’s fencing class stood as the arena for the display of chivalry and skill. Cid mingled with the throng, his persona of the hapless jester intact—until the barb of an insult, cast carelessly by a brash classmate, pierced the veneer of his performance. “Nicht einmal der Schatten deiner Cousine Ellis,” the provocateur sneered, a remark designed to sting, comparing him unfavorably to the ever-capable, martially inclined Ellis and his sister, the formidable Claire Kaganovitch. (Not even the shadow of your cousin Ellis.) The words gripped Cid’s pride and wrung from him a response unbidden. Shikatanai, ima misemasu. (Unavoidable, now I’ll show you.) His control faltered, and the room fell silent as Cid took up his foil. With a swiftness unseen since his arrival at the academy, Cid’s strikes became a blurred exhibit of precision and grace. Each opponent, whether driven by malice or mere challenge, met the floor with a thud, their ambitions laid out flat—flattened by the unleashed fraction of Cid’s genuine capacity. Linda watched, her amazement shared with some measure of delight, yet marred by apprehension as the spectacle unfolded. Je savais qu’il y avait plus en lui… Her thoughts circled in German and French, while her outward exclamation carried the shock that gripped the room. “C’est incroyable, il est un maître!” (It’s incredible, he is a master!) Silvia, bearing witness to the spectacle, allowed a smirk to creep across her features, her thoughts twined in French and German contemplation. Qui aurait cru que le bouffon pourrait danser avec le fer comme un poète avec des mots? Her musings melted into vocal admiration. “Remarkably done, truly!” she acknowledged, the ritual of fencing now an exposition of Cid’s secret finesse. With every strike, parry, and riposte, Cid commanded the platform. Yet his triumph soared beyond the mere conquest of lessers; it struck at the heart of his concealed nature, the identity shrouded beneath the facade of buffoonery now laid bare for those perceptive enough to see. Headmaster Osmond, long accustomed to the triumphs of his tutors and the squabbles of the schooled, sensed more beyond the glint of steel. His suspicions, already germinating, blossomed anew as he observed the enigma that was Cid. Il y a quelque chose de caché… Ce n’est pas seulement l’adresse avec lequel il manie son épée, he mused, his thoughts a tapestry of French and English intrigue. “This skill… I must keep a closer watch on him.” As the class concluded and students shuffled out, the memory of Cid’s fencing prowess lingered like the afterimage of lightning—imposing and indelible. In this world of steam-powered machinations and diesel-fueled dreams; of dark seinen undercurrents, noble quests, and cybernetic auguries; of geopolitical might and the shadowed paths walked by those who would spy and disrupt—Cid’s revelation stood as a turning point, an unveiled secret that would ripple through the corridors of power, magic, and machination that made Tristain the heart of an empire unchallenged in might and mystique since the days of old. The chapter closed with the image of Cid’s foil resting upon the rack—a blade unsullied, wielded by hands more familiar with war than with jest, in a realm where every action tipped scales not seen, but felt in the hearts of all those caught in history’s grand, unfolding tale. [First version of the prototype chapter ends here] [Second version of the prototype chapter starts here] — Chapter Twelve: The Prodigal’s Restraint The metallic ring of steel echoed through the fencing salle, where students gathered, lunging and parrying with the earnestness of those dedicated to the art. At the center of it all, Cid remained his usual, carefree self, laughter easily spilling from his lips after each playful thrust. Little did they know, bubbling just beneath that jocund surface lay adeptness far beyond the academy’s wildest imaginings. It began with a jest—a thinly veiled jab comparing his swordplay to that of his famed relatives, Ellis and Claire, intended to coax the fool into overextending himself in the class exhibition. Yet the words struck a deeper chord within Cid, prying at the vault where his true skills lay dormant. “Kore wa tadashī toki ja nai,” Cid inwardly chided himself, struggling to maintain the mask he had so carefully constructed around his life at Tristain. (“This is not the right time,” Cid inwardly chided himself, struggling to maintain the mask he had so carefully constructed around his life at Tristain.) With composure frayed, he stepped onto the piste, his classmates’ condescending French murmurs clawing at his restraint. It took one footfall, one breath, and the simmering intensity of his capabilities manifested in a subtle yet telltale flourish. Cid’s riposte was a whisper of steel that caught his opponent off-guard, laying him flat in one elegant maneuver that suggested the prankster had more up his sleeve than devilish tricks. A murmur arose among the onlookers as Skel and Pol looked on with wide-eyed confusion. “Hättest du das gesehen? Wie hat er das gemacht?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief. (“Would you have seen that? How did he do that?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief.) Ash, witnessing the scene while practicing his own form nearby, felt a twitch of recognition. “Nani ka ano kokan ni himitsu ga aru gibi,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring. (“It’s as if there is some secret to that exchange,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring.) Ellis, peering from the sidelines, admired the silent grace of Cid, her disbelief melting into pride. “Er versteckt sein wahres Können…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root. (“He hides his true ability…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root.) Across the room, Linda and Silvia, both under their aliases Rinslet and Linda, stood agape, their minds churning with unspoken questions. “Quelle surprise… Cid est incroyable,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement. (“What a surprise… Cid is incredible,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement.) Headmaster Osmond, ever-observant from the vantage of his office, sharpened his gaze. The boy before him—one moment a clown, the next, a virtuoso of swordplay—drew the tendrils of suspicion tighter. “Y a-t-il quelque chose que je ne sais pas sur cet élève?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities. (“Is there something I don’t know about this student?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities.) As the class drew to a close, and murmurs swept through the salle like passing zephyrs, Cid returned to his jovial antics, his earlier display of finesse tucked away like a card up a magician’s sleeve. The fool’s mask returned to his face as he jaunted over to his friends, deflecting praise with a toss of his hair and a dismissive joke. The day had passed, leaving in its wake a new intrigue, kindling the fires of speculation within the academy’s stone-clad walls. — [Second version of the Prototype chapter ends here]","completion":"Chapter Twelve: Shadows and Steel In the dimly-lit fencing salle, echoing with the rhythmic clash of steel, an unusual spectacle was about to unfold. Cid, known amongst his peers for his carefree demeanor and seemingly lackadaisical approach to everything, found himself at the center of attention, a position he usually managed to avoid with his skillful act of the fool. However, today was different. A sharp, derisive comment comparing his abilities to those of his renowned relatives, Ellis and Claire, cut through the usual banter, igniting a fire within Cid. \\"Nicht einmal der Schatten deiner Cousine Ellis,\\" the jab aimed to wound, found its mark, but not in the way the provocateur had anticipated. \\"Shikatanai, ima misemasu,\\" Cid muttered under his breath, the playful glint in his eyes hardening into something more formidable. As he stepped onto the piste, the room's laughter and murmurs fell away to an anticipatory hush, the air thick with the promise of unseen prowess. With the finesse of a shadow dancer, Cid's movements blurred into a symphony of steel and elegance. Each strike and parry, a testament to the depth of his hidden skill, left his challengers in stunned disbelief as they were systematically and beautifully overpowered. Watching from the sidelines, Linda and Silvia exchanged incredulous looks, their earlier assessments of Cid crumbling under the weight of his now obvious prowess. \\"C’est incroyable, il est un maître!\\" Linda couldn't help but exclaim, her voice carrying both shock and admiration. Silvia, a smile playing on her lips, nodded in agreement, her mind already racing with the implications of Cid's unveiled capabilities. Meanwhile, Ellis looked on, a complex mix of pride and curiosity blooming within her. Her cousin, always the enigma, had once again surprised her. The spectacle drew the attention of Headmaster Osmond as well, who watched from the shadows with a keen eye. \\"Il y a quelque chose de caché… Ce n’est pas seulement l’adresse avec lequel il manie son épée,\\" he mused, his curiosity piqued. The headmaster was no stranger to secrets, and he sensed that Cid's performance was more than just a moment of pride—it was a glimpse into a depth yet to be fully understood. As the fencing class concluded, the atmosphere was abuzz with whispered theories and awed speculation. Cid's display had not only challenged the preconceived notions of his peers but also marked a turning point in the academy's dynamics. In a world where magic intertwined with the gears of clockpunk innovation and the dark alleys of urban intrigue, Cid's revelation had cast ripples across the surface of their shared reality. Though he returned to his jovial antics, the mask he wore so effortlessly before seemed to fit a little less snugly now. Those with keen eyes could see the truth—beneath the guise of the fool lay a master of both blade and shadow, whose journey was intertwined with the fate of an empire caught between the old ways of magic and the new dawn of steampunk and dieselpunk innovation. As the day waned and the gears of destiny turned, the enigma that was Cid promised to be a conundrum that would challenge not only the corridors of power within Tristain but also the very boundaries of their world, standing at the precipice of myth and machine."},{"prompt":"In my game called star system generator, give density of gas giants","completion":"Gas giants within a star system typically have a lower density compared to terrestrial planets.

Johnny Test was a pretty good ratings grabber for Kids' WB, but I'm not sure if 4Kids will pick up the new season. Though, if they don't, I'm sure Cartoon Network will get it. TaoRen New Member JoinedDec 11, 2007 Messages18 LocationVirginia Jul 12, 2008 #192 Will there be a new season of Viva Pinata? Rare is working on the new game and the DS version is coming out. The Metarex story of Sonic X also aired in France. TMS had listed it as still in production a while after it ended its run but they stopped that. I wouldn't have minded if it had kept going its a decent show. Chaotic might be bearable with the possible move from flash. Goldstar! Goldstar!

Anyway, 2 questions come to mind regarding a 4th season of Johnny Test: 1. What else can Johnny do? The producers have pretty much covered just about everything in the past 3 seasons. He's even prevented an alien invasion. I thought that episode was supposed to be the series finale. Other than travel to the astral plane or witness the beginning of the universe, I don't see what other territory Johnny has yet to cover. 2. Where would the new episodes of JT go? I don't see 4Kids picking up the series, and Kids WB is no more. The only other channel that I can see airing Johnny Test would be Cartoon Network, who is currently running JT ad nausea.

That would have been a perfect way to cap off the series, even though there were a couple of plot holes in the story (we never saw Johnny's dad get freed from Brain Freezer's ice trap and Johnny's mom wasn't seen at all in the episode). bigddan11 bigddan11 Justice must be served!

No, I don't think 4Kids will air it on either block. The ratings were abysmal and the stories weren't that good. When the ratings at the end were almost as low as the educational block ratings reruns with that spot and premiere episodes, then I don't think it will be picked up. They could always surprise us, but with TMNT: Back to the Sewers, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Smeshariki, Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight, Spectacular Spider-Man, Chaotic, and Huntik: Secrets and Seekers, it doesn't seem like a show that would fit on CW4Kids, which is where they would probably air it. I believe those last two spots will go to Skunk Fu! and Magi-Nation, if they choose shows currently on 4Kids, in some fasion, to return- Skunk Fu! because it's on their web site, and Magi-Nation because while it fulfills the e/i requirements, it also has a lot of the action elements the other shows have. 4Kids TV most likely has the following: Dinosaur King (premiere episodes) Viva Pinata (premiere episodes) Adrenaline Project (premiere episodes- meets e/i) Winx Club (depends on how soon season 4 starts, but it could be premiere episodes- meets e/i) Sonic X Kirby: Right Back At 'Ya! 2 shows TBA Light Lucario Light Lucario Moderator Staff member Moderator JoinedMay 11, 2007 Messages49,158 LocationIn a Dream World Jul 12, 2008 #199 So Johnny Test gets another season?

I agree with bigddan11 on how Johnny Test wouldn't really fit with the other shows that 4Kids has for the CW4Kids or probably even 4KidsTV. Since Cartoon Network is playing the show like crazy, I think that that's where the new season will show up. Write a continuation saying that it's more likely XS will return as a KWB show, besides, we have Smeshariki for humor anyway","completion":"It seems there was a lot of speculation and discussion about the future of \\"Johnny Test\\" among fans back in 2008, with debate focusing on whether a new season would air, and if so, where. Since then, \\"Johnny Test\\" has indeed seen more seasons and has retained a presence on television and streaming platforms. The series originally aired from 2005 to 2014, ending after six seasons. However, in 2020, it was announced that \\"Johnny Test\\" would be revived with new episodes premiering on Netflix, starting with the seventh season released in 2021. This revival was a significant update many years after the original speculation on its future. Regarding the concerns and discussions from the fans mentioned, Cartoon Network did indeed become a significant broadcaster for \\"Johnny Test\\" after the merger of Kids' WB into The CW network, where it found a consistent audience. The series' longevity and the decision to eventually revive it for Netflix further underscores its popularity and the demand for more content among its fan base. The mention of other shows and networks, such as 4Kids, CW4Kids, and discussions about other series, highlights the dynamic nature of children's television programming during that era, with networks and creators frequently adjusting their lineups to capture audience interest and meet contractual obligations. The children's television landscape has seen substantial evolution, with streaming platforms like Netflix becoming major players alongside traditional cable networks."},{"prompt":"I was suggesting to write a continuation to the forum convo","completion":"Ah, I see! My apologies for the oversight. Let's craft a continuation to the conversation with an imaginative leap, reacting to the given discussion in the previous message: --- Goldstar! July 13, 2008 #200 So, with all this chatter about \\"Johnny Test,\\" are we all overlooking the fact that Cartoon Network seems to be the most logical home? Considering their track record with animation, and given that \\"Johnny Test\\" has performed well in reruns, it wouldn't surprise me if they outbid everyone for the new season. It's all about the ratings at the end of the day, and \\"Johnny Test\\" has a quirky enough charm to keep pulling in viewers, especially the younger crowd. As for \\"World of Quest\\" and some of the other shows being batted around here, I think the landscape of children's programming is in for a significant shift. Remember, we're moving into an era where digital platforms could start to play a bigger role in how content is delivered. Maybe not immediately, but it's on the horizon. Imagine a world where streaming platforms could directly commission seasons of animated shows. That could change the game entirely, not just for \\"Johnny Test\\" but for many others. ChaoticFan99 July 14, 2008 #201 @Goldstar! Streaming platforms commissioning shows? That sounds like science fiction! Right now, the buzz is all about cable and network battles. Though, I have to concede, the idea of watching a show anytime without having to wait for networks to air episodes does sound pretty appealing. Back to \\"Johnny Test\\" - if Cartoon Network grabs it, I just hope they don't run it into the ground with endless reruns. There's such a thing as too much of a good thing, after all. But this could also open doors for them to experiment with more original content, maybe take more risks. Imagine if they brought back classics or explored new ideas with the same fervor. PixelPants July 15, 2008 #202 You folks are missing a crucial factor here: merchandise. Shows like \\"Johnny Test\\" aren't just about ratings; they're about the toys, the lunchboxes, the video games. If CN or any other network sees a potential goldmine in merchandising rights, that might tip the scales in favor of picking up the show. The question is, does \\"Johnny Test\\" have that kind of merchandising potential, or is it purely a ratings play? In any case, I'm intrigued by this whole digital platform discussion. Maybe it's a bit \\"out there\\" right now, but who knows? In ten years, we could all be laughing about how we doubted the rise of streaming. TechTurtle July 16, 2008 #203 @ChaoticFan99, @PixelPants, @Goldstar! - All valid points. What strikes me the most is this shift towards digital content consumption that Goldstar! mentioned. While \\"Johnny Test\\" finding a new home is the immediate concern, the bigger picture here is how we watch TV is changing. Networks might be the kings now, but the digital realm is fast approaching. Shows with niche but loyal fanbases like \\"Johnny Test\\" could benefit greatly from this, finding new life and even expanded universes in digital formats. Don't underestimate the power of fan demand either - it could play a significant role in reviving shows or keeping them running longer than expected. As for the rest, only time will tell. But one thing's for sure, we're on the cusp of a new era in television and entertainment. --- This imagined conversation extends the original discussions, respectfully. It touches on speculation about the future of television distribution, the importance of merchandise, and the role of fan demand, all of which have become increasingly relevant in the years since the original posts were made."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up going back to talking about CW4Kids, saying if a Kids WB show was to return it's more likely XS will return as it is action based, and besides if we want humor, then Viva Pinata and Smeshariki will have it","completion":"--- ChaoticFan99 July 17, 2008 #204 Shifting gears back to the CW4Kids discussion, considering the lineup and the type of content that's been successful, if we were to see a Kids' WB show make a return, my bet's on \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" (XS) over anything else. It's action-packed, has a solid fan base, and fits the vibe that CW4Kids seems to be leaning into. \\"Johnny Test\\" has its charm, sure, but with \\"XS,\\" there's a rich universe that hasn't been fully explored yet. Plus, the action genre seems to have a resilient appeal. As for the humor aspect we've all been circling around, have we not considered that Viva Piñata and Smeshariki fill that slot quite adeptly? Each of these shows brings a unique style of comedy that complements the action-heavy lineup without overloading the schedule with the same type of content. Viva Piñata, with its vibrant world and quirky characters, offers a type of humor that's distinct from the goofball antics of \\"Johnny Test.\\" Meanwhile, Smeshariki, even though it's not as widely recognized, brings in a clever, almost whimsical style of humor that has the potential to appeal to both kids and the older demographic that sometimes tunes in. PixelPants July 19, 2008 #205 @ChaoticFan99, you make some compelling points about \\"Xiaolin Showdown.\\" It really was a unique show that blended action and humor well, perhaps even paving the way for more shows of its kind on CW4Kids. The martial arts theme mixed with the quest for Shen Gong Wu was both entertaining and educational in a way, touching on aspects of Chinese mythology and philosophy. Definitely a missed opportunity if they don't consider bringing it back or exploring that universe further. And yes, \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"Smeshariki\\" do bring diversity to the comedic offerings of the channel. However, it's crucial that CW4Kids (and networks in general) don't rely too heavily on a single genre or type of show. The key to a successful lineup is balance - balancing action with humor, fantasy with reality, and so on. This not only ensures a wider audience but also keeps the content fresh and engaging. TechTurtle July 20, 2008 #206 Reflecting on the diversity of content and what \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" could bring to the table, it's clear that nostalgia plays a significant role in what audiences, especially the slightly older demographic, want to see return. CW4Kids has an opportunity to capitalize on this by reintroducing shows that have proven their worth in the past but with a fresh twist. Shows like \\"Xiaolin Showdown\\" offer just that - a blend of action, humor, and adventure that isn't just about winning battles but also about personal growth and friendship. In conclusion, while we speculate on what could or should make a return, it's evident that a well-rounded lineup that caters to different tastes and interests is key to keeping viewers engaged. Whether through action, humor, or a combination of both, the ultimate goal should be delivering quality content that resonates with its audience. Hopefully, CW4Kids and other networks take note and continue to innovate and diversify their programming to reflect the evolving landscape of children's television. --- This continuation further explores the potential for \\"Xiaolin Showdown's\\" return, emphasizing the importance of a balanced programming mix for CW4Kids while acknowledging the strengths of existing humorous shows like \\"Viva Piñata\\" and \\"Smeshariki.\\" It reflects on content strategy and the broader implications for the network and its audience."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where the new lineup is confirmed, and we see the schedule","completion":"--- PixelPants July 25, 2008 #207 Big news, everyone!

It'll be interesting to see the ratings and how this mix resonates with today's audience, particularly in an age where streaming platforms are beginning to emerge as contenders. The success of this lineup could set a precedent for future programming decisions, perhaps encouraging more networks to delve into their archives and revitalize shows that have the potential for a successful comeback. Beyond ratings, it's a celebration of the evolution of children's television, as we see networks adapting and responding to viewer preferences and trends. --- This imagined follow-up to the forum conversation discusses the reveal of the new CW4Kids lineup, excitement over the return of \\"Xiaolin Showdown,\\" and the balance of content in the schedule, emphasizing the potential impact and significance of such programming choices."},{"prompt":"do you think the passage is natural, clear and error-free: Fujian Investment Group has over 100 holding enterprises, with stakes in nearly 200 projects and subsidiaries in Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR and Taiwan Province.

Johnny Test was a pretty good ratings grabber for Kids' WB, but I'm not sure if 4Kids will pick up the new season. Though, if they don't, I'm sure Cartoon Network will get it. TaoRen New Member JoinedDec 11, 2007 Messages18 LocationVirginia Jul 12, 2008 #192 Will there be a new season of Viva Pinata? Rare is working on the new game and the DS version is coming out. The Metarex story of Sonic X also aired in France. TMS had listed it as still in production a while after it ended its run but they stopped that. I wouldn't have minded if it had kept going its a decent show. Chaotic might be bearable with the possible move from flash. Goldstar! Goldstar!

Anyway, 2 questions come to mind regarding a 4th season of Johnny Test: 1. What else can Johnny do? The producers have pretty much covered just about everything in the past 3 seasons. He's even prevented an alien invasion. I thought that episode was supposed to be the series finale. Other than travel to the astral plane or witness the beginning of the universe, I don't see what other territory Johnny has yet to cover. 2. Where would the new episodes of JT go? I don't see 4Kids picking up the series, and Kids WB is no more. The only other channel that I can see airing Johnny Test would be Cartoon Network, who is currently running JT ad nausea.

That would have been a perfect way to cap off the series, even though there were a couple of plot holes in the story (we never saw Johnny's dad get freed from Brain Freezer's ice trap and Johnny's mom wasn't seen at all in the episode). bigddan11 bigddan11 Justice must be served!

I suppose 1 could go to Johnny Test, but I doubt it will since they pulled Test for reruns of The Batman, and CN, with it being one of their highest rated shows, would most likely pay Cookie Jar more money to air it than 4Kids would.

No, I don't think 4Kids will air it on either block. The ratings were abysmal and the stories weren't that good. When the ratings at the end were almost as low as the educational block ratings reruns with that spot and premiere episodes, then I don't think it will be picked up. They could always surprise us, but with TMNT: Back to the Sewers, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Kikoriki, Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight, Spectacular Spider-Man, Chaotic, and Huntik: Secrets and Seekers, it doesn't seem like a show that would fit on CW4Kids, which is where they would probably air it. I believe those last two spots will go to Skunk Fu! and Magi-Nation, if they choose shows currently on 4Kids, in some fasion, to return- Skunk Fu! because it's on their web site, and Magi-Nation because while it fulfills the e/i requirements, it also has a lot of the action elements the other shows have. 4Kids TV most likely has the following: Dinosaur King (premiere episodes) Viva Pinata (premiere episodes) Adrenaline Project (premiere episodes- meets e/i) Winx Club (depends on how soon season 4 starts, but it could be premiere episodes- meets e/i) Sonic X Kirby: Right Back At 'Ya! 2 shows TBA Light Lucario Light Lucario Moderator Staff member Moderator JoinedMay 11, 2007 Messages49,158 LocationIn a Dream World Jul 12, 2008 #199 So Johnny Test gets another season? I'm kind of surprised since I thought most of the Kids' WB shows that weren't Spiderman wouldn't get another season. I agree with bigddan11 on how Johnny Test wouldn't really fit with the other shows that 4Kids has for the CW4Kids or probably even 4KidsTV.

Just a tad spicy Joined: Jun 4, 2007 Messages: 22,307 Location: Cartoon Country Jul 12, 2008 #200 Given the shift towards more action-oriented shows in recent years, it's refreshing to see a demand for lighter, more comedic series. While Johnny Test had its moments, there's a noticeable gap left by its unique blend of adventure and humor. I'd personally like to see more shows that can cater to both elements effectively.

It had an excellent mix of martial arts action packed with a healthy dose of humor. Now that Johnny Test is paving the way for a new slot, it'd be a perfect opportunity to bring Xiaolin Showdown back or something similar in spirit.

It had that perfect balance where parents wouldn't mind sitting down and watching it with their kids. If networks are looking to fill the void left by Johnny Test with something light-hearted yet adventurous, they should definitely consider reviving Xiaolin Showdown or introducing shows with a similar vibe. It seems like there's a real hunger for content that doesn't always take itself too seriously but still delivers on the action front.

It had a certain charm that's lacking in many of today's shows, which tend to lean heavily into either pure action or outright comedy. Bringing back that kind of balance would be awesome. Plus, there's so much potential for new stories and showdowns.

Given that 4Kids has two open slots for the fall season, this could be our chance to introduce more comedic elements back into the mix. So far, most of what we have leans towards the serious side, which is fine, but a little variety could serve us well. CartoonAficionado Fan of All Things Animated Joined: Apr 25, 2007 Messages: 3,411 Jul 13, 2008 #205 Absolutely, bigddan11. The removal of Tom and Jerry marks the end of an era but also opens up possibilities. Given the current slate, our comedic options are indeed limited. We need something that can bring laughter back into the weekend mornings. Let's hope the decision-makers at 4Kids are taking note and considering shows that can provide a mix of the hilarity and light-heartedness we've been missing. NostalgiaNerd Retro Enthusiast Joined: May 2, 2008 Messages: 1,245 Jul 13, 2008 #206 Just to address some rumors floating around - NO, \\"World of Quest\\" is NOT returning to fill one of those open slots.

We're exploring other options that can breathe some comedic life back into the lineup. Stay tuned for announcements on what those two slots will be filled with. Hopefully, we'll find a good balance that our viewers will love. LaughTrack Comedy King Joined: Jul 30, 2006 Messages: 2,198 Jul 13, 2008 #207 This is a crucial moment for 4Kids. While the action-packed series are great, we're sorely lacking in shows that just aim to entertain and amuse. Sure, action shows can have their funny moments, but it's not the same as a show dedicated to comedy. With Tom and Jerry gone, which genuinely appealed to both kids and adults with its classic humor, we need something that can fill those shoes. A new comedy, perhaps something animated that adults remember fondly or a brand new concept with potential for humor, would be perfect. Let's bring back the laughs! ToonAddict Animation Aficionado Joined: Jan 9, 2006 Messages: 5,330 Jul 13, 2008 #208 While it's sad to see traditional comedy like Tom and Jerry go, maybe this is an opportunity to innovate. There's a goldmine of comedic talent and concepts out there that can translate well to animation. Let's aim for something that bridges generations - a show with wit and charm that echoes the timeless appeal of Tom and Jerry but through a modern lens. Comedy is universal, and if executed right, can become a cornerstone of weekend morning programming once again. --- This mock-up discussion among animated show fans highlights a shared desire for more comedy and variety in 4Kids' programming lineup, especially with the departure of a classic like Tom and Jerry.

With comedy being such a universal language, I really think 4Kids is missing out on tapping into a broader audience by not balancing the genres more evenly.

It's a tall order for one show, sure, but sometimes that's all it takes to shift the tide.

Cid mingled with the throng, his persona of the hapless jester intact—until the barb of an insult, cast carelessly by a brash classmate, pierced the veneer of his performance. “Nicht einmal der Schatten deiner Cousine Ellis,” the provocateur sneered, a remark designed to sting, comparing him unfavorably to the ever-capable, martially inclined Ellis and his sister, the formidable Claire Kaganovitch. (Not even the shadow of your cousin Ellis.) The words gripped Cid’s pride and wrung from him a response unbidden. Shikatanai, ima misemasu. (Unavoidable, now I’ll show you.) His control faltered, and the room fell silent as Cid took up his foil. With a swiftness unseen since his arrival at the academy, Cid’s strikes became a blurred exhibit of precision and grace. Each opponent, whether driven by malice or mere challenge, met the floor with a thud, their ambitions laid out flat—flattened by the unleashed fraction of Cid’s genuine capacity. Linda watched, her amazement shared with some measure of delight, yet marred by apprehension as the spectacle unfolded. Je savais qu’il y avait plus en lui… Her thoughts circled in German and French, while her outward exclamation carried the shock that gripped the room. “C’est incroyable, il est un maître!” (It’s incredible, he is a master!) Silvia, bearing witness to the spectacle, allowed a smirk to creep across her features, her thoughts twined in French and German contemplation. Qui aurait cru que le bouffon pourrait danser avec le fer comme un poète avec des mots? Her musings melted into vocal admiration. “Remarkably done, truly!” she acknowledged, the ritual of fencing now an exposition of Cid’s secret finesse. With every strike, parry, and riposte, Cid commanded the platform. Yet his triumph soared beyond the mere conquest of lessers; it struck at the heart of his concealed nature, the identity shrouded beneath the facade of buffoonery now laid bare for those perceptive enough to see. Headmaster Osmond, long accustomed to the triumphs of his tutors and the squabbles of the schooled, sensed more beyond the glint of steel. His suspicions, already germinating, blossomed anew as he observed the enigma that was Cid. Il y a quelque chose de caché… Ce n’est pas seulement l’adresse avec lequel il manie son épée, he mused, his thoughts a tapestry of French and English intrigue. “This skill… I must keep a closer watch on him.” As the class concluded and students shuffled out, the memory of Cid’s fencing prowess lingered like the afterimage of lightning—imposing and indelible. In this world of steam-powered machinations and diesel-fueled dreams; of dark seinen undercurrents, noble quests, and cybernetic auguries; of geopolitical might and the shadowed paths walked by those who would spy and disrupt—Cid’s revelation stood as a turning point, an unveiled secret that would ripple through the corridors of power, magic, and machination that made Tristain the heart of an empire unchallenged in might and mystique since the days of old. The chapter closed with the image of Cid’s foil resting upon the rack—a blade unsullied, wielded by hands more familiar with war than with jest, in a realm where every action tipped scales not seen, but felt in the hearts of all those caught in history’s grand, unfolding tale. [First version of the prototype chapter ends here] [Second version of the prototype chapter starts here] — Chapter Twelve: The Prodigal’s Restraint The metallic ring of steel echoed through the fencing salle, where students gathered, lunging and parrying with the earnestness of those dedicated to the art. At the center of it all, Cid remained his usual, carefree self, laughter easily spilling from his lips after each playful thrust. Little did they know, bubbling just beneath that jocund surface lay adeptness far beyond the academy’s wildest imaginings. It began with a jest—a thinly veiled jab comparing his swordplay to that of his famed relatives, Ellis and Claire, intended to coax the fool into overextending himself in the class exhibition. Yet the words struck a deeper chord within Cid, prying at the vault where his true skills lay dormant. “Kore wa tadashī toki ja nai,” Cid inwardly chided himself, struggling to maintain the mask he had so carefully constructed around his life at Tristain. (“This is not the right time,” Cid inwardly chided himself, struggling to maintain the mask he had so carefully constructed around his life at Tristain.) With composure frayed, he stepped onto the piste, his classmates’ condescending French murmurs clawing at his restraint. It took one footfall, one breath, and the simmering intensity of his capabilities manifested in a subtle yet telltale flourish. Cid’s riposte was a whisper of steel that caught his opponent off-guard, laying him flat in one elegant maneuver that suggested the prankster had more up his sleeve than devilish tricks. A murmur arose among the onlookers as Skel and Pol looked on with wide-eyed confusion. “Hättest du das gesehen? Wie hat er das gemacht?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief. (“Would you have seen that? How did he do that?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief.) Ash, witnessing the scene while practicing his own form nearby, felt a twitch of recognition. “Nani ka ano kokan ni himitsu ga aru gibi,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring. (“It’s as if there is some secret to that exchange,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring.) Ellis, peering from the sidelines, admired the silent grace of Cid, her disbelief melting into pride. “Er versteckt sein wahres Können…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root. (“He hides his true ability…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root.) Across the room, Linda and Silvia, both under their aliases Rinslet and Linda, stood agape, their minds churning with unspoken questions. “Quelle surprise… Cid est incroyable,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement. (“What a surprise… Cid is incredible,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement.) Headmaster Osmond, ever-observant from the vantage of his office, sharpened his gaze. The boy before him—one moment a clown, the next, a virtuoso of swordplay—drew the tendrils of suspicion tighter. “Y a-t-il quelque chose que je ne sais pas sur cet élève?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities. (“Is there something I don’t know about this student?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities.) As the class drew to a close, and murmurs swept through the salle like passing zephyrs, Cid returned to his jovial antics, his earlier display of finesse tucked away like a card up a magician’s sleeve. The fool’s mask returned to his face as he jaunted over to his friends, deflecting praise with a toss of his hair and a dismissive joke.

His days were punctuated by laughter and jest, a performance so meticulously crafted that none suspected the depths of his prowess—until a challenge, wrapped in the guise of an insult, beckoned the truth into the light. “Nicht einmal der Schatten deiner Cousine Ellis,” the brazen shout spurred Cid into action, unraveling the self-imposed bindings of restraint with an audacity that left the room teetering on the edge of disbelief. Shikatanai, ima misemasu, his thoughts murmured, a silent declaration that the time for modesty had passed. With grace that belied his jocular facade, Cid danced through the melee of his classmates, his foil an extension of his will, dispatching challenges with an elegance that whispered of secrets and shadows. “C’est incroyable, il est un maître!” Linda exclaimed, her astonishment mirrored by her Masked counterpart, Silvia, as they watched the jest vanish beneath a display of unrivaled finesse. Their murmurs, a tapestry of languages, entwined with the air of intrigue that now filled the salle. Even as Skel and Pol expressed their disbelief, Ash and Ellis watched with an intensity born of recognition and curiosity. “Er versteckt sein wahres Können…” Ellis mused, her pride tinged with the thrill of an unfolding mystery. Yet, it was the keen eyes of Headmaster Osmond that saw beyond the immediate. “Y a-t-il quelque chose que je ne sais pas sur cet élève?” he pondered, the seeds of suspicion nestled amongst genuine interest.

Wie hat er das gemacht?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief. (“Would you have seen that? How did he do that?” Skel uttered in mixed German and English, his tone a perfect blend of surprise and disbelief.) Ash, witnessing the scene while practicing his own form nearby, felt a twitch of recognition. “Nani ka ano kokan ni himitsu ga aru gibi,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring. (“It’s as if there is some secret to that exchange,” he noted to himself, cataloging every unexpected movement of Cid’s under the guise of sparring.) Ellis, peering from the sidelines, admired the silent grace of Cid, her disbelief melting into pride. “Er versteckt sein wahres Können…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root. (“He hides his true ability…” she pondered in her native French-German blend, a new curiosity taking root.) Across the room, Linda and Silvia, both under their aliases Rinslet and Linda, stood agape, their minds churning with unspoken questions. “Quelle surprise… Cid est incroyable,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement. (“What a surprise… Cid is incredible,” Linda breathed, wonder lacing her words as Silvia nodded in silent agreement.) Headmaster Osmond, ever-observant from the vantage of his office, sharpened his gaze. The boy before him—one moment a clown, the next, a virtuoso of swordplay—drew the tendrils of suspicion tighter. “Y a-t-il quelque chose que je ne sais pas sur cet élève?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities. (“Is there something I don’t know about this student?” he asked himself, his bilingual thoughts circling around potentialities.) As the class drew to a close, and murmurs swept through the salle like passing zephyrs, Cid returned to his jovial antics, his earlier display of finesse tucked away like a card up a magician’s sleeve. The fool’s mask returned to his face as he jaunted over to his friends, deflecting praise with a toss of his hair and a dismissive joke. The day had passed, leaving in its wake a new intrigue, kindling the fires of speculation within the academy’s stone-clad walls. — [Second version of the Prototype chapter ends here]","completion":"In a sprawling metropolis where the gears of time meshed seamlessly with the pulses of magic, stood an academy renowned not just for its academic prowess but also as a crucible where the fabled and the mundane intertwined. Here, in a world fused with clockpunk’s intricate design, steampunk innovation, and the faint glimmers of early cyberpunk vision, the tale of Cid, a student seemingly versed only in jest, unfolded. Amid the rhythmic clashing of fencing foils, a mixed ambience of eager anticipation and scholarly discipline enveloped the salle. Cid, known among his peers for his carefree laughter and perceived lack of seriousness, found his usual jovial demeanor challenged by a taunt that cut deeper than the steel of any blade. Compared unfavorably to his martially adept relatives, Ellis and Claire, a spark ignited within him, a reminder of the depths concealed beneath his carefully curated facade. “Nicht einmal der Schatten deiner Cousine Ellis,” the barb rang out, resonating within the hall and striking a chord within Cid. It was a call he could not ignore, a gauntlet thrown that demanded not just acceptance but a revelation of sorts. The onlookers, comprising a unique blend of students familiar with tales from Seirei Gensouki, Code Geass, Dragonar Academy, and beyond, found themselves unwitting witnesses to a spectacle that would challenge their perceptions of the boy known as Cid. With a fluidity that belied his usual demeanor, Cid engaged his opponents, transforming the salle into a stage where each movement was both an answer and a declaration. His foil, an extension of his will, danced through the defenses of his challengers with precision that left no room for doubt. The crowd, a diverse tapestry of characters from worlds both diverse yet interconnected by the threads of destiny, watched in silent awe. Linda, cloaked in the dual mantle of student and observer, found her thoughts swirling in a mix of languages, the scene unraveling her understanding of the boy before her. “C’est incroyable, il est un maître!” her exclamation broke the silence, echoing the sentiment that rippled through the assembled crowd. Silvia, her gaze sharpened by countless encounters and alliances formed in the shadows, acknowledged the performance with a smirk. The sight of Cid, transcending the limitations imposed by narrow perception, was a revelation that spoke of untold depths. Headmaster Osmond, a figure seasoned by years and the weight of overseeing a place where futures were forged, sensed the shift in the tides. The boy’s display, while extraordinary, hinted at secrets veiled behind layers of machination and intrigue—a puzzle that beckoned to be solved. As the spectacle concluded and the normalcy of academy life resumed its course, whispers and speculations wove through the crowd. Cid’s return to his facade of jest served only to deepen the mystery, leaving his peers and observers with questions that clamored for answers. In a world where magic, technology, and the hidden threads of destiny intertwined, Cid’s unveiling marked not just a turning point in his narrative but a confluence of paths destined to intersect. The story of a master concealed within the guise of a jester would ripple through the corridors of power, magic, and intrigue, challenging the status quo and drawing the eyes of empires and rebels alike. As the city’s clockwork heart beat its steady rhythm and the gears of fate continued their inexorable turn, the stage was set for tales of grandeur, shadowed paths, and the unwavering quest for truth in a world bound by steam, magic, and the unyielding progress of early cybernetic dreams."},{"prompt":"Могут ли отличаться одинаковые числа друг от друга количеством знаков после запятой, если одно из них было записано в double, а другое - во float?","completion":"Да, одинаковые числа могут отличаться количеством знаков после запятой, если одно из них было записано в double, а другое - во float.

Hmm… Johnny Test was a pretty good ratings grabber for Kids’ WB, but I’m not sure if 4Kids will pick up the new season. Though, if they don’t, I’m sure Cartoon Network will get it. TaoRen New Member JoinedDec 11, 2007 Messages18 LocationVirginia Jul 12, 2008 #192 Will there be a new season of Viva Pinata? Rare is working on the new game and the DS version is coming out. The Metarex story of Sonic X also aired in France. TMS had listed it as still in production a while after it ended its run but they stopped that. I wouldn’t have minded if it had kept going its a decent show. Chaotic might be bearable with the possible move from flash. Goldstar! Goldstar!

Anyway, 2 questions come to mind regarding a 4th season of Johnny Test: 1. What else can Johnny do? The producers have pretty much covered just about everything in the past 3 seasons. He’s even prevented an alien invasion. I thought that episode was supposed to be the series finale. Other than travel to the astral plane or witness the beginning of the universe, I don’t see what other territory Johnny has yet to cover. 2. Where would the new episodes of JT go? I don’t see 4Kids picking up the series, and Kids WB is no more. The only other channel that I can see airing Johnny Test would be Cartoon Network, who is currently running JT ad nausea.

That would have been a perfect way to cap off the series, even though there were a couple of plot holes in the story (we never saw Johnny’s dad get freed from Brain Freezer’s ice trap and Johnny’s mom wasn’t seen at all in the episode). bigddan11 bigddan11 Justice must be served!

There’s also the factor that Johnny Test has some funding from Warner, and Warner likes to get their stuff on CN whenever they can. judyindisguise Active Member JoinedOct 10, 2005 Messages6,042 Jul 12, 2008 #197 bigddan11 said: 4Kids has already said they have 18 series airing this fall.

No, I don’t think 4Kids will air it on either block. The ratings were abysmal and the stories weren’t that good. When the ratings at the end were almost as low as the educational block ratings reruns with that spot and premiere episodes, then I don’t think it will be picked up. They could always surprise us, but with TMNT: Back to the Sewers, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D’s, Kikoriki, Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight, Spectacular Spider-Man, Chaotic, and Huntik: Secrets and Seekers, it doesn’t seem like a show that would fit on CW4Kids, which is where they would probably air it. I believe those last two spots will go to Skunk Fu! and Magi-Nation, if they choose shows currently on 4Kids, in some fasion, to return- Skunk Fu! because it’s on their web site, and Magi-Nation because while it fulfills the e/i requirements, it also has a lot of the action elements the other shows have. 4Kids TV most likely has the following: Dinosaur King (premiere episodes) Viva Pinata (premiere episodes) Adrenaline Project (premiere episodes- meets e/i) Winx Club (depends on how soon season 4 starts, but it could be premiere episodes- meets e/i) Sonic X Kirby: Right Back At ‘Ya! 2 shows TBA Light Lucario Light Lucario Moderator Staff member Moderator JoinedMay 11, 2007 Messages49,158 LocationIn a Dream World Jul 12, 2008 #199 So Johnny Test gets another season?

I agree with bigddan11 on how Johnny Test wouldn’t really fit with the other shows that 4Kids has for the CW4Kids or probably even 4KidsTV.

It had an excellent mix of martial arts action packed with a healthy dose of humor. Now that Johnny Test is paving the way for a new slot, it’d be a perfect opportunity to bring Xiaolin Showdown back or something similar in spirit. The dynamics between the characters and the quest aspect made it an engaging watch. Plus, who doesn’t miss saying “Gong Yi Tanpai”?

It had that perfect balance where parents wouldn’t mind sitting down and watching it with their kids. If networks are looking to fill the void left by Johnny Test with something light-hearted yet adventurous, they should definitely consider reviving Xiaolin Showdown or introducing shows with a similar vibe. It seems like there’s a real hunger for content that doesn’t always take itself too seriously but still delivers on the action front.

While the action-packed series are great, we’re sorely lacking in shows that just aim to entertain and amuse. Sure, action shows can have their funny moments, but it’s not the same as a show dedicated to comedy.

It could potentially be a fan-created work or an unofficial title referring to elements from various Zelda games; however, I can explain the components of the title and how they might relate to Zelda's themes, followed by translations. The title \\"Time Twilight Tears\\" could reference several themes or elements from The Legend of Zelda series: 1. **Time:** Time travel and manipulation of time are recurring themes in Zelda games. Notably, \\"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\\" involves time travel as a central mechanic, with Link moving between child and adult states to solve puzzles and progress in the game. 2. **Twilight:** This likely refers to \\"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess,\\" a game where Link transitions between the world of light and the Twilight Realm, dealing with the consequences of twilight covering Hyrule. 3. **Tears:** Could refer to several elements, such as the Tears of Light that Link must collect in \\"Twilight Princess\\" to dispel the twilight covering different areas of Hyrule, or it might symbolize sadness, loss, or other themes present in the Zelda series. Translations that sound natural to native Spanish speakers might involve slightly rephrasing the title to maintain its poetic and thematic elements. Here are three possible translations: 1. **Lágrimas del Crepúsculo Temporal:** This directly translates to \\"Tears of the Temporal Twilight.\\" It maintains the original order while sounding natural in Spanish. \\"Temporal\\" can refer to time-related aspects, fitting the theme. 2. **Crepúsculo y Lágrimas de Tiempo:** This translates to \\"Twilight and Tears of Time.\\" It emphasizes the elements of twilight and tears, linking them explicitly to time. This option rearranges the order for a smoother flow in Spanish. 3. **Lágrimas en el Crepúsculo del Tiempo:** This means \\"Tears in the Twilight of Time.\\" It suggests the tears exist within a specific moment, emphasizing the narrative or emotional weight of time and twilight in the title. The reason for these translations is to maintain the poetic and evocative nature of the original title while ensuring it flows naturally and is understandable in Spanish. Translations often have to balance between literal accuracy and capturing the spirit or mood of the original, especially for titles that are meant to intrigue or evoke specific feelings."},{"prompt":"با استفاده از مستندات زیر یک کد برای برقراری ارتباط و گرفتن قیمت بیت کوین بصورت وب سوکت از صرافی بایننس برای من بنویس https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/websocket_api/en/#contact-us","completion":"برای برقراری ارتباط با WebSocket صرافی بایننس و دریافت قیمت بیت کوین در زمان واقعی، نیاز به استفاده از کتابخانه \`websocket\` در پایتون دارید. اگر این کتابخانه را ندارید، می‌توانید با استفاده از pip آن را نصب کنید: \`\`\` pip install websocket-client \`\`\` در زیر، یک نمونه کد برای اتصال به WebSocket صرافی بایننس و دریافت قیمت بیت کوین (BTC) به دلار آمریکا (USDT) ارائه شده است: \`\`\`python import websocket import json def on_message(ws, message): message_json = json.loads(message) print(\\"Price of BTC/USDT: \\", message_json['c']) def on_error(ws, error): print(\\"Error: \\", error) def on_close(ws): print(\\"Connection closed\\") def on_open(ws): subscribe_message = { \\"method\\": \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", \\"params\\": [ \\"btcusdt@ticker\\" # اشتراک گذاری در تیکر قیمت بیت کوین به دلار آمریکا ], \\"id\\": 1 } ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message)) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # آدرس WebSocket صرافی بایننس ws_address = \\"wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@trade\\" ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(ws_address, on_message=on_message, on_error=on_error, on_close=on_close) ws.on_open = on_open ws.run_forever() \`\`\` نکات مهم: - \`on_message\`: این تابع زمانی فراخوانی می‌شود که یک پیام از سرور WebSocket دریافت شود. در اینجا، ما قیمت جاری (آخرین قیمت) بیت کوین به دلار آمریکا را چاپ می‌کنیم. - \`on_error\`: اگر خطایی در اتصال رخ دهد این تابع فراخوانی می‌شود. - \`on_close\`: زمانی که اتصال WebSocket بسته شود این تابع اجرا می‌شود. - \`on_open\`: این تابع زمانی اجرا می‌شود که اتصال WebSocket برقرار شود. در این تابع، یک پیام JSON برای اشتراک در تیکر قیمت بیت کوین به دلار آمریکا ارسال می‌شود. توجه داشته باشید که این کد یک نمونه بسیار ساده است و در محیط‌های حرفه‌ای، باید از روش‌های استاندارد تر و امن‌تری برای مدیریت اتصالات، خطاها و قطعی اتصال استفاده کنید."},{"prompt":"برای دریافت قیمت با kline از طریق وب سوکت باید چیکار کنم","completion":"برای دریافت داده‌های \`kline\` (شمعی) بیت کوین به دلار آمریکا (BTC/USDT) از طریق WebSocket در صرافی بایننس، شما نیاز به ارسال پیام اشتراک با فرمت مشخصی دارید که شامل بازه زمانی مورد نظر برای داده‌های \`kline\` است. بنابراین، برای اشتراک در داده‌های \`kline\`، ابتدا باید تنظیمات اتصال به WebSocket را به روز کنیم و سپس پیام اشتراک مناسب را ارسال کنیم. در این مثال، ما از بازه زمانی 1 دقیقه‌ای \`1m\` برای BTC/USDT استفاده می‌کنیم. \`\`\`python import websocket import json def on_message(ws, message): message_json = json.loads(message) print(\\"Received kline: \\", message_json) def on_error(ws, error): print(\\"Error: \\", error) def on_close(ws): print(\\"Connection closed\\") def on_open(ws): subscribe_message = { \\"method\\": \\"SUBSCRIBE\\", \\"params\\": [ \\"btcusdt@kline_1m\\" # اشتراک گذاری در داده‌های kline برای BTC/USDT با بازه زمانی 1 دقیقه ], \\"id\\": 1 } ws.send(json.dumps(subscribe_message)) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": # آدرس WebSocket صرافی بایننس ws_address = \\"wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@kline_1m\\" ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(ws_address, on_message=on_message, on_error=on_error, on_close=on_close) ws.on_open = on_open ws.run_forever() \`\`\` این کد، به صورت واقعی و در هر 1 دقیقه، داده‌های \`kline\` را برای جفت ارز BTC/USDT دریافت و نمایش می‌دهد. هر پیام دریافتی شامل اطلاعاتی مانند قیمت شروع، پایان، بالاترین قیمت، پایین‌ترین قیمت و حجم معاملات در آن بازه زمانی 1 دقیقه‌ای خواهد بود. لطفاً توجه داشته باشید که برای استفاده از این کد به صورت حرفه‌ای و در برنامه‌های بلندمدت، باید کد را برای مدیریت استثنائات، قطعی اتصال موقت و امور امنیتی به‌روز و توسعه دهید."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He is said to be the ruler of a shadowy realm that lies between the cracks of reality, a place where the rules of the mundane world do not apply. The Earl is a figure of great power and influence, feared and respected by those who know of him. His domain is said to be a place of darkness and secrets, where the shadows themselves seem to twist and writhe with malevolent intent. Those who seek out The Earl do so at their own peril, for it is said that he is a being of immense cunning and intellect, always one step ahead of those who would challenge him. Some say that he is a faerie king, others believe him to be a fallen angel or a demon from the pits of hell. Regardless of his true nature, The Earl is a figure to be reckoned with, his very presence instilling fear and awe in those who encounter him. And though his motives may be mysterious and his methods inscrutable, one thing is certain - The Earl is a force to be reckoned with in the world of Neverwhere."},{"prompt":"Hypothetical Neverwhere concept, - There is a circle of magic called the 'Seven Sisters' ...","completion":"In the dark and fantastical world of Neverwhere, there exists a mysterious and powerful circle of magic known as the \\"Seven Sisters.\\" These sisters are believed to be the most adept and skilled practitioners of magic in all of the realms, each possessing a unique and elemental affinity that sets them apart from others. Each sister is rumored to specialize in a specific type of magic, harnessing the forces of nature and the elements to weave powerful spells and incantations. The eldest sister, known as Selene, is said to command the power of the moon and stars, casting spells of divination and foresight. Her younger sister, Aurora, wields the power of the sun and fire, using her flames to purify and destroy. The other sisters - Luna, Terra, Oceanus, Zephyr, and Vesna - each possess their own elemental gifts, controlling the forces of water, earth, air, and seasons with unparalleled skill and precision. Together, the Seven Sisters form an unbreakable bond of sisterhood and magic, using their combined powers to protect the realms from dark forces and malevolent beings. Many seek out the Seven Sisters for their wisdom and guidance, believing that they hold the key to unlocking the true potential of magic. But gaining their favor is no easy task, as the sisters are known to be both benevolent and fiercely protective of their secrets.

The rivalry between these factions grew ever more bitter, leading to a climactic battle that ended in the banishment of the Seven Sisters to the desolate and haunted realm of Highbury Fields. Highbury Fields, a place shrouded in darkness and mystery, is a barren wasteland where time stands still and the echoes of ancient magic linger in the air. The Sisters were stripped of their powers and imprisoned in this desolate place, their once formidable magic weakened and twisted by the malevolent forces that now held sway over them. Despite their imprisonment, the Seven Sisters refused to be broken, their spirits unbowed and their determination unshakable. In the shadows of Highbury Fields, they banded together once more, using what little magic remained to them to forge a plan of escape and retribution against their captors. As the powers of Kings Cross and St Pancras grew ever more complacent and arrogant in their victory, they underestimated the resilience and cunning of the Seven Sisters. The Sisters plotted and schemed, biding their time until the moment was right to strike back and reclaim their rightful place as the masters of magic in the realms. And so, the stage was set for a new chapter in the epic saga of Neverwhere, where the Seven Sisters would rise from the ashes of defeat to challenge the powers that banished them and restore the balance of magic to the realms once more."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
