Here are some reasons why weaving is important in Maori culture: 1. Cultural Preservation: Weaving is deeply rooted in Maori tradition and has been passed down from generation to generation. It serves as a means of preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and practices. Through the art of weaving, Maori people can maintain a connection to their ancestors and preserve their cultural heritage. 2. Symbolism and Whakapapa: Weaving often incorporates symbols and patterns that carry cultural meaning and represent different aspects of Maori identity and history. Weaving holds a special place in whakapapa (genealogy) as it can visually represent the interconnectedness and relationships between individuals, families, and iwi (tribes). 3. Whanau and Community Bonding: Weaving is often a communal activity that brings whanau (family) and community members together. The process of gathering natural resources, preparing materials, and weaving creates opportunities for shared experiences, learning, and bonding among generations. It helps strengthen social connections and creates a sense of belonging and identity within the community. 4. Functional and Practical Purposes: Historically, weaving was essential for providing clothing, shelter, and functional items such as nets, baskets, and mats. These items were used in everyday life, for fishing, gathering, and storage. Weaving skills were necessary for survival, making it an integral part of Maori culture. 5. Creative Expression and Artistry: Weaving is considered a form of artistic expression that allows weavers to showcase their creativity and skills. The intricate patterns and designs in traditional Maori weaving display a high level of craftsmanship and individuality. Weaving is seen as a way to celebrate and express Maori culture through aesthetic beauty. 6. Economic Opportunities: Weaving has also become an important source of income for some Maori communities. It provides economic opportunities through the creation and sale of traditional woven items, allowing Maori weavers to generate income and sustain their cultural practices. Overall, weaving plays a central role in Maori culture, representing cultural preservation, symbolism, community bonding, practicality, creativity, and economic opportunities. It serves as a powerful medium for expressing and celebrating Maori identity, values, and traditions."},{"prompt":"How are you able to transfer these skills to teaching a specific age group within the ECE context?","completion":"As an AI language model, I can provide general suggestions for how weaving skills can be incorporated into teaching a specific age group within the early childhood education (ECE) context. However, it's important to note that actual implementation may vary depending on the specific age group, ECE center, and curriculum. Here are some ways weaving skills can be transferred to teaching within the ECE context: 1. Sensory Exploration: For younger age groups (such as infants and toddlers), weaving can be introduced as a sensory exploration activity. Provide soft and safe materials like fabric strips or ribbons that children can manipulate, weave through fingers, and explore different textures. This helps develop fine motor skills and sensory awareness. 2. Art and Craft Activities: Preschool and kindergarten age groups can engage in various art and craft activities related to weaving. This can include creating paper weavings using colored strips, making simple looms using cardboard or popsicle sticks, and weaving yarn, ribbons, or fabric through the loom to create patterns and designs. 3. Cultural Education: Integrate weaving activities with learning about different cultures, including Maori culture. Teach children about the significance of weaving in Maori culture, the patterns and symbolism used, and the traditional materials involved. Use pictures, videos, and storytelling to engage children and promote cultural understanding. 4. Collaborative Projects: Encourage collaboration and teamwork by engaging children in group weaving projects. Provide a large-scale loom or a collaborative weaving structure where multiple children can contribute to creating a collective weaving piece. This fosters social skills, communication, and shared decision-making. 5. Outdoor Weaving: Take advantage of the outdoor environment by incorporating natural materials into weaving activities. Encourage children to explore and collect leaves, grasses, and other materials from nature. Create simple outdoor looms with ropes or tree branches and guide children in weaving these natural elements into their creations. 6. Literature Connections: Use children's books that highlight weaving, fibers, or cultural crafts as part of literacy activities. Read stories or poems related to weaving, and then engage children in related art or craft projects. This helps integrate language development with hands-on experiences. Remember, when incorporating weaving skills in the ECE context, it's important to consider age-appropriate materials, safety measures, and supervision. Always adapt the activities to suit the developmental abilities and interests of the specific age group you are working with."},{"prompt":"Do you know the newly open coffee shop located in China Shanghai Jingan district called Roastelier?","completion":"Yes, I am familiar with Roastelier.

Standing at 6'0, with well-groomed, dark-blonde hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. He's ranked Grade 1, above his self-proclaimed rival Noritoshi Kamo as well as the late Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru), and Utahime Iori, the student supervisor at Kyoto. This means he's considered to be a genius, as Grade 2 alone is exceptional for students. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, and lived with his mentor, a special grade sorcerer, the controversial Yuki Tsukumo, in Kyoto from 6 to 12. During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. He doesn't agree with this. He doesn't intend to save others for the sake of doing so, but fights curses more for his own enjoyment and the money and status it brings. Yuki is not the only person he's acquainted with. He's close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi's father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he's grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they've grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" She's very aware that she isn't strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she's driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - truffade. He's friends with Aoi Todo, though their personalities could not be any more different. They were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question \\"What kind of girls are you into?\\" There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can harvati, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strings that are more like wires. The thickness can be modified, as well as the sharpness. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even a formidable whip. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien is hot-blooded, passionate about everything he does. He loves the thrill of battle. He enjoys reading about military history in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.","completion":"Julien Vaugrenard is a compelling addition to the world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" with his unique cursed energy abilities tied to various types of cheese. His rich backstory provides various points of connection with established characters, as well as potential conflicts and motivations. Here's how we might integrate such a character into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" storyline: **Integration into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" World:** 1. **Character Dynamics:** Having Julien as a Grade 1 sorcerer immediately sets him up as a rival and an ally to existing characters. His competition with Noritoshi Kamo can lead to collaborative growth for both characters, and their dynamic can add tension during inter-school events or battles against curses. 2. **Training Under Yuki Tsukomo:** Julien's training under Yuki, who is a special grade sorcerer, hints at intriguing character development and potential plotlines. Through Julien, readers could explore more of Yuki's character and her unique perspective on the jujutsu world. 3. **Sorcerer Abilities - Cheese-Based Techniques:** - **Fromage à pâte dure:** Julien's ability to create constructs for offense and defense adds tactical versatility to battles and can juxtapose nicely against more traditional curse techniques. - **Ficello & Magma:** With flexible and explosive cheese-based techniques, Julien brings a creative edge to the traditional shonen battle scenes, which are generally filled with more straightforward elemental and physical powers. - **Vieux Boulogne & Fromage Noir:** The use of these techniques can serve as a wild card during encounters, allowing for unexpected victories or desperate measures in battle. 4. **Relationship with Kasumi Miwa:** Julien and Kasumi's history offers a subplot filled with personal growth, tension, and camaraderie. Kasumi's conflict about feeling \\"Useless Miwa\\" can be exacerbated or alleviated through their interactions, and Julien’s actions can either bridge or widen the gap between them. 5. **Potential Story Arcs:** - A sub-plot exploring Julien's inner conflict about his reasons for becoming a sorcerer and his true motivation, contrasting with his external charm and carefree facade. - An arc where Julien's family's bakery is threatened by curses, pulling Julien into a dilemma that tests his values and resolve. - A crossover encounter with the Tokyo School, where Julien's abilities and tactical ingenuity could help resolve a high-stakes conflict. 6. **Characterization through Interactions:** - Julien's passion and expertise in cheese can serve as comic relief as well as character depth, showcasing his passions outside of battle and providing a signature quirk that would resonate with fans. - His relationship with his sister Annick can serve to humanize him further and draw out vulnerabilities that could be used against him by antagonists or as a plot device to demonstrate growth. Overall, Julien Vaugrenard sounds like a character who could add depth and flavor to \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" complementing and contrasting the existing cast in interesting ways and injecting a fresh twist to the sorcery battles. His unique cheese-based techniques would provide visual flair and strategic complexity, and his personal storylines could weave seamlessly with the themes of ambition, camaraderie, and moral ambiguity explored in the series."},{"prompt":"He's capable of domain expansion, and he's styled it after his distant Gallic ancestors. He also learned Simple Domain from Yuki Tsukumo. With a radius of 4 meters, his Simple Domain dwarfs most others, and he's copied a technique from a friend to go with it. It's Miwa's \\"New Shadow Style: Simple Domain\\" attack. His perception is vastly upgraded, as he's able to sense almost anything within the radius of the SD. Also upgraded are his effective striking distance, reflexes, and speed. Unlike Kasumi, he isn't required to quickly sheathe his weapon. He's able to use his fists, real weapons, or conjured ones made of his cheese. Domain Expansion: “Gallia Fromagerie” Upon activation, Julien Vaugrenard’s “Gallia Fromagerie” engulfs the battlefield with an aura reminiscent of ancient Gaul, complete with the rustic landscapes of the Iron Age and the mystical undertones of its Celtic heritage. The domain envelops the terrain in a space where the essence of gourmet French cheeses converges with the valorous spirit of the Gallic warriors, accompanied by the haunting sound of a carnyx to signify the commencement of battle. Within “Gallia Fromagerie,” Julien calls upon a legion of cheese shikigami, each with specialized abilities: 1. Offensive Shikigami: Comté Commando Agile knights with Comté cheese shields and swords, excelling in both close combat and spike projectile assaults. 2. Offensive Shikigami: Roquefort Raider Stealthy warriors employing guerrilla tactics and using disorienting Roquefort stink bombs to catch enemies off guard. 3. Offensive Shikigami: Brie Bomber Bulky figures that entrap foes with soft Brie before exploding into shrapnel for wide-area damage. 4. Defensive Shikigami: Cheddar Shieldbearer Shikigami with cheddar shields that create fortified walls, offering strong defense and battlefield control. 5. Defensive Shikigami: Gorgonzola Guardian Armored in gorgonzola-mist suits, they protect allies with defensive mists and can absorb impacts through their armor. 6. Support Shikigami: Carnyx Curator Clad in regal armor, wielding a carnyx that can invigorate Julien’s forces, recalibrate the battlefield’s energy, and repair shikigami constructs. 7. Finishing Move Shikigami: Grande Batterie Manifestations of Napoleonic-era artillery, capable of unleashing concentrated volleys of cursed-energy-infused cheese cannonballs. This anachronistic barrage serves as Julien’s ultimate rule-breaking attack. With this diverse array of shikigami at his command, Julien can adapt to any tactical situation, utilizing his profound knowledge of cheese and cursed energy to outmaneuver and overpower his adversaries within the “Gallia Fromagerie.” The shikigami are not seen outside of his Domain Expansion.","completion":"Julien Vaugrenard's Domain Expansion, \\"Gallia Fromagerie,\\" is thematically rich and provides significant opportunities for combo attacks and strategic depth within the world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" Here's how such a Domain Expansion could influence the narrative and enhance battle scenes: **Narrative and Battle Dynamics:** 1. **Domain Expansion Presence:** Julien's control over his domain makes him a formidable opponent. \\"Gallia Fromagerie\\" would serve as a storytelling device to show his prowess and highlight pivotal moments of combat prowess, especially during high-stakes battles where he must use sophisticated tactics against equally powerful adversaries. 2. **Cultural and Historical Inspiration:** The Gallic inspiration adds to the mystique of his powers and brings a fresh aesthetic to the Jujutsu landscape. This cultural layer can provide a narrative background, possibly connecting Julien's family heritage to a long line of sorcerers or augmenting the significance of his abilities through historical parallels. 3. **Shikigami Diversity:** Each cheese-based shikigami symbolizes Julien's intricate understanding of his curse techniques and allows for a wide range of maneuvers, from stealth and ambush attacks with the Roquefort Raider to defensive strategies using the Cheddar Shieldbearer. This diverse set of subordinates would provide rich visual imagery and creative fight choreography. 4. **Enhanced Perception and Adaptability:** Julien's Simple Domain and the effectiveness of his Domain Expansion showcase his advanced skill level and combat intelligence. His heightened perception and swift adaptation create intense, high-speed battles where he can systematically dismantle opponents within his domain. 5. **Character Development and Growth:** Julien's abilities require immense cursed energy control and a deep knowledge of his craft. As he grows stronger, potential arcs could explore the limitations and drawbacks of such vast power, forcing Julien to confront weaknesses, emotional or tactical, to overcome stronger foes or complex scenarios. 6. **Connection to Kasumi Miwa:** Highlighting Julien's ability to adapt Miwa's technique suggests that their bond is not merely one-sided; Julien respects her enough to incorporate her style into his own, which can offer character depth and show mutual influence despite the difference in their strength. 7. **Conflict with Antagonists:** The elaborateness of \\"Gallia Fromagerie\\" could invite unique challenges when facing particularly cunning or resilient antagonists, leading to tense, dramatic encounters where Julien must outwit and overpower using his entire arsenal of shikigami and cheese techniques. 8. **Impact on Sorcerer Society:** A domain as grand and strategically sound as \\"Gallia Fromagerie\\" could elevate Julien's standing among sorcerers. Simultaneously, it could incite envy, intrigue, or even alliances, influencing the broader geopolitical landscape between different sorcerer factions. In essence, Julien's character and his \\"Gallia Fromagerie\\" Domain Expansion serve as a testament to his combat acumen, sorcerer lineage, and tactical genius. Incorporating such a multifaceted and visually stunning ability into \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" would add depth to the series' magic system and provide readers with exhilarating and majestic battle sequences."},{"prompt":"Like his mentor Yuki, he's quite brash, outspoken, and cavalier. He's proud of his abilities, he's blunt, and not afraid to question others' abilities, especially considering his own strength. His strength, appearance, and personality have indeed made him fangirls, some of them closer to him than he thinks. He's close with Kasumi Miwa, though he's oblivious to the crush the second-year swordswoman has on him, and her desire to impress him. Sadly, she seems to be a magnet for bad luck. Maki once stole her katana in the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event, (and now she could steal something more precious), she's lost another katana, and even broke a third. She practices a swordsmanship style called New Shadow Style. She can combine this with her Simple Domain for the technique New Shadow Style: Simple Domain. Her cirle is 2.21 meters (for comparison Julien's is 4 meters), and she's supposed to be able to intercept anything that enters its range, but Yuji Itadori once bypassed it with his speed, and she was defeated by Maki in spite of using this another time. Her father Eizo once saved the Vaugrenard family bakery when Julien was young, so he's grateful to Kasumi and her family, and he considers it his obligation to protect her.Julien and Kasumi are childhood friends with close families, and they are known to spend free time together; they enjoy bowling. Kasumi wins most of the time. Eizo, along with the aforementioned Yuki, taught him about the existence of cursed energy, and his unique talents were quickly noticed by Yuki Tsukimo. Kasumi is painfully aware of her limits, and she calls herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" Julien is friends with Aoi Todo, and he (both Julien and Aoi) are very willing to discuss the type of women they prefer, though the question would never leave the lips of Julien himself. He's willing to answer, however, as Aoi Todo is not the source of this question but Yuki Tsukumo who trained both. Yuki would intensify his training if he refused to give a straight answer. His ideal woman is long-legged, athletic, and strong, like Tokyo's Maki Zenin (she's around 175cm). Whom he's spent much of his first year in a complicated relationship with, but they seem to find each other all the same, despite the whole two break ups thing. The nature of their relationship is so fickle, and because they frequently flirt with each other regardless, no one really knows when they've crossed the line, or when they've broken up. Maki has no cursed energy, so she's a black sheep of the Zenin family. She relies on her own physical strength and cursed tools. She's also a low-ranked Grade 4, because her family blocks her promotions. Maki is a very good training partner for Julien because he also seeks to hone his physical skill, though he will mock her for lacking cursed energy if provoked by her. He's now in the process of refining technique that allows him to create handheld weapons that can be used for a long time reliably - greatswords, hammers the size of his body, battle axes, spears and polearms. These constructs require immense cursed energy but Julien is special. It's suspected he has more latent cursed energy than his mentor Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade, but he refuses to let others get a reliable measurement of all he truly holds. He outclasses Maki when he uses his cheese, as he has much more freedom with his powers. At this point in the story, two Kyoto High sorcerers have died recently in battle against special grade curses. Mai Zenin against Hanami, and Kokichi Muta (Mechamaru) against Mahito. No one is more aware that to be a sorcerer is to put your life on the line than the dwindling Kyoto School. Maki seemingly always finds a way to spar with Julien, even when she's supposed to be on a mission. His relationship with Noritoshi Kamo can best be described as profesional. He finds Momo Nishimiya suffocating. She, like Aoi Todo and Noritoshi Kamo, is a third-year student, and she takes this very seriously, though he dislikes being bossed around; at this point he's overdue to have his cursed energy measured, and Momo thinks he takes too much after Tsukumo, whom Momo and most Jujutsu sorcerers see as in irresponsible layabout, a terrible role model. He's cordial with Arata Nitta, a fellow first-year student, one with the ability to prevent injuries from getting worse. Nitta is seldom seen on the training grounds, instead honing his support power. Later in the scene, Todo, Maki, Kamo, Kasumi, Momo, and Julien all agree to fight each other in a battle royale, to prepare themselves for unconventional battle. (Note: Simulate both a scene that encapsulates the relationship between the sorcerers and leads into a scenario where the battle royale is agreed to, but not the battle royale itself.) Scene and dialogue.","completion":"In the serene courtyard of Kyoto Jujutsu High, beneath the afternoon sun that casts a warm glow over the training grounds, Julien Vaugrenard maneuvers effortlessly through a set of self-imposed drills. Imaginary enemies collapse as construct weapons materialize and dissipate in rapid succession—proof of Julien’s seamless command of cursed energy. Kasumi Miwa, standing to the side with her sheathed katana, watches earnestly, an unnoticed flutter of admiration in her eyes. The distant din of Kyoto fades as the clashing of Julien's conjured weaponry takes center stage. \\"Why so serious, Miwa? Planning to impress someone with a new move?\\" Maki Zenin strides onto the scene, sarcasm sharp as her gaze lands on Julien. Kasumi stammers, flustered, \\"No, I—I was just...\\" \\"Julien doesn't need babysitting, you know,\\" Maki teases, flashing a challenging look at the blond sorcerer. Aoi Todo and Noritoshi Kamo approach, drawn by the sound of conversation and the anticipation of competition. Curious, Momo Nishimiya and Arata Nitta follow not far behind, Nitta always preferring to avoid the limelight. Julien brushes a hand through his hair and turns to face the assembly of sorcerers. Despite the casual air he projects, an electric anticipation hums around him—a palpable sense of a rising storm. \\"I see we're all gathered, a rare opportunity,\\" Julien remarks with a cavalier grin. \\"Why not take advantage of this head-to-head chance?\\" \\"Oh? Trying to set up a date with doom, Vaugrenard?\\" Maki challenges, crossing her arms. Kamo, lips pressing into a subtle smile, responds, \\"A spar amongst us might be instructive. Showing off isn't Julien's sole domain.\\" Momo fixes her glasses with a determined glint in her eye. \\"A battle royale could indeed be beneficial,\\" she declares, her voice imbued with an authority that surpasses her years. \\"It's essential to keep our skills sharp. And Julien, no more delays on assessing your cursed energy, understood?\\" Julien lifts a hand in mock surrender. \\"Fine, fine. But let's make today's brawl worth it, then.\\" Todo claps both Julien and Kamo on the shoulders in his usual rough camaraderie. \\"Brothers, remember—the type of woman one prefers says a lot about their fighting spirit!\\" Shaking his head with a wry smile, Julien deflects, \\"Let's just focus on the battle, shall we?\\" Kasumi tightens her grip on her katana, stepping forward. \\"I—I want to join as well. I have to become stronger. For all of us.\\" Julien's gaze softens just for a moment, an unspoken promise of protection passing between them. \\"Of course, Miwa. It wouldn't be the same without you.\\" Nitta nods approvingly from the back, already strategizing how to offer support from the sidelines. The tension breaks as laughter and friendly banter ripple through the group. Each sorcerer looks at the others—an eclectic representation of power and potential, sharpened by camaraderie and competition. Kamo assumes a more formal tone. \\"Then let us commence. May we all emerge from this exercise as better jujutsu sorcerers.\\" \\"Agreed,\\" the others echo, as they spread out across the training grounds, each finding their place within the impromptu arena. As the sun dips lower, casting longer shadows across the courtyard, an air of seriousness descends. Weapons are drawn, cursed energy crackles, and all eyes are locked in shared determination and unspoken strategies. Julien stands ready, enthusiasm clear in his stance. \\"Let's show the true mettle of Kyoto Jujutsu High!\\" With nods of acknowledgement, the battle royale awaits, a crucible from which all will emerge changed, for better or for worse."},{"prompt":"Julien arrogantly challenges everyone at the same time. Kasumi is worried about potentially getting hurt, or hurting him, but using cheese he cuffs her hands together just as the battle begins, removing her from the fight. It's to protect her. (Note: Momo's broom is a cursed tool. Her innate technique, Tool Manipulation, is to telepathically control her broom, allowing her to levitate it independently of herself. She can use her broom to strike and can generate powerful gusts of cursed energy wind. Also, by swinging her broom as she rides it, Momo can launch a strong gust of cursed energy wind towards her opponents. This is known an application of Tool Manipulation, specifically \\"Wind Scythe.\\" Aoi's Innate Technique allows him to switch the positions of anything with cursed energy within his range with a clap of his hands. He can change himself out with the location of another person, or switch two different parties other than himself as well. He's incredibly strong and adept in hand-to-hand combat, and he has easily overpowered Megumi Fushiguro and Yuji Itadori. His strength is likened to a gorilla. He can combine misdirection with his extraordinary strength. If fighting with allies he can teleport cursed tools near the ally if he's to replace the object with something or someone else. The object can then easily be plucked out of the air. He can replace a person with an object and vice versa but only if the person has cursed energy. Maki has no cursed energy, but she can receive an object imbued with it, including ordinary objects Todo has infused with his energy.) Scene and dialogue. Julien does end up winning, with his creativity, vast moveset, and quick reflexes. Maki and Todo give him fits, however. Scene and dialogue.","completion":"In the open courtyard of Kyoto Jujutsu High, the group of sorcerers stands ready, the air thick with anticipation and audacious egos waiting to clash. Julien, with a smirk playing on his lips and a glint in his bluish-grey eyes, surveys his assembled peers. \\"Come on, then,\\" Julien challenges, arms wide in an inviting gesture of overconfidence. \\"Why take turns when you could all try and take down Kyoto's best together?\\" A chorus of disgruntled murmurs ripples through the group. Kasumi's expression morphs into worry, her usually composed stance betraying a hint of trepidation. \\"Julien, that's reckless!\\" Kasumi protests, concern lacing her voice. \\"What if someone gets hurt? Or worse, what if I hurt—\\" But before Kasumi can finish, Julien casually flicks his wrist, and in an instant, a set of cheese cuffs clamp around her wrists, sealing them together with a solidity that echoed the age-old cellars of France. \\"This is for your own good, Miwa,\\" Julien says, a playful yet apologetic undercurrent to his tone. \\"Can't have you getting in the way now, can we?\\" As the impromptu battle commences, Aoi Todo's hulking presence seems to embody raw, primal strength, his eyes sharpening as they fixate on Julien's movements. \\"Your confidence will be your downfall,\\" Maki snorts, gripping her weapon a touch tighter, ready to exploit any opening. Momo, floating slightly above on her broom, directs a \\"Wind Scythe\\" toward Julien, an opening gambit to test his reflexes. Julien elegantly sidesteps the gust with feline grace, a soft cheese shield blooming in his hand to deflect the residual breezes. Todo claps, and the atmosphere shifts. Julien whirls around to find Maki in place of a boulder, swinging a mid-air cursed tool at him. His quills of Parmigiano Reggiano launch slyly, intercepting the attack mid-swing, creating an opening for him to leap forward. Julien's movements are slick, intuitive, nearly improv musical renditions of his diverse arsenal. Yet Todo's brute force and ingenuity, Maki's physical prowess and tactical cursed tools, all lend themselves to a symphony of clashing intents. As the battle progresses, swift dexterous maneuvers pit Julien against the surprising agility of Todo, whose misdirection and raw power coalesce into a formidable onslaught. Maki watches, her analytical mind dissecting each flourish and parry, her own potent combo of physicality and accursed weaponry gnawing at Julien's defenses. Beneath the chaos, Kasumi struggles fruitlessly with her restraints, watching with a blend of awe and frustration as Julien artfully dodges and weaves through the maelstrom, her heart pounding with concern amid the thrill. The fight escalates into a spectacle of cursed energy, raw athleticism, and quick-witted tactics—but amidst the tension, Julien's presence commands the narrative. With cheese constructs buoyed by cleverness, he soon gains the upper hand—a bomb of Molten Magma here, a flurry of Comté Commando spikes there—ensnaring his adversaries in a web of calculated chaos. As the dust settles, the sorcerers are downed one by one, each acknowledging his unexpected depth, the breath of their challenge carried away by the wind. Maki, begrudgingly impressed, rises to her feet. \\"You win this one, Vaugrenard. But don't get cocky—it won't be so easy next time.\\" Todo laughs heartily, clapping Julien on the back. \\"Well done, brother. A woman with long legs wouldn't be fast enough to catch you today,\\" he jests, acknowledging both the victory and the singular preference they share. Julien exhales deeply, offering a hand to help Kasumi to her feet, unlatching the cheese cuffs with a flick of his fingers. \\"No one hurt, Miwa. You see, I've got this under control.\\" Kasumi's glare softens into reluctant gratitude. \\"I know, Julien… I know.\\" Their eyes meeting, Julien's smile widens. \\"Let's grab something to eat, shall we? My treat for winning.\\" As they make their way out of the courtyard, the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows and golden hues upon the path—a path that continues to forge their destinies in the world of jujutsu sorcery."},{"prompt":"写几篇僵尸新娘的日记，搞笑有趣一些","completion":"日记一： 亲爱的日记， 今天是我和我的真命天子终于步入婚姻殿堂的大日子！我一直期待着这一天，怀揣着满满的幸福，当然还有那颗不太平静的僵尸心脏！哈哈哈！我想象着我的心上人穿着帅气的黑西装，手里还牵着我那又瘦又骨感的僵尸手臂，真是让人鸡皮疙瘩都起来了！ 婚礼上一切都进行得很顺利，我的花轿抵达教堂的时候，还有一些人吓得腿都软了！不过好在我妆容精致，一点都看不出我是一个“特殊”的新娘。当我和我的心上人面对面站在神父面前时，我甚至看到一些观众变得苍白了起来，他们的脸色几乎可以和我的白纱比拟！太好笑了！ 婚后的洞房花烛夜，我不禁想知道我的新郎是否能抵挡住我那“吻”的诱惑。我们亲吻的瞬间，我可以感受到他的身体瑟瑟发抖，但我想那只是他因为紧张吧！哈哈！我暗自偷笑。这一晚过得真是太有趣了！ 明天就是我们的蜜月旅行了，我打算带我的新郎去丛林里享受一顿“新鲜”的食物，然后看看他能不能象运动员一样跑得飞快！不过，我甚至可以想象到他在那片茂密树林中疯狂地摔跤，尽管全身都是伤痕累累，他还会带着幸福满意的笑容回到我身边。 嗯，我真的真的很幸福，能和我的真命天子走到一起、相濡以沫。 不管是在生活中还是在死亡之后，我们将永远在一起，幸福地奔向僵尸中的永恒！ 见字如面，心里暖洋洋。 你的幸福僵尸新娘。 日记二： 亲爱的日记， 昨天是我和我的真命天子的蜜月第一天。我决定带他去一家高级餐厅品尝一下人类的美食！店里所有的人都惊讶地看着我们：“哇，这是最特别的客人！”哈哈，可不是嘛？毕竟我带着我的真命天子来这里也是有点另类。 菜单上我看到了一个那么诱人的菜品：“血红汉堡”。我心想，这简直是为我而设计的！我马上点了一份，心满意足地等待着上菜。当它放到我面前的时候，我竟然发现它是生肉堆积起来的！那些色彩鲜艳的西红柿、生菜都毫无存在感，完全被堆积的鲜红肉块给掩盖了！哈哈哈，这可真是妙不可言！ 看着旁边吃惊的人们，我更加得意地享用着这一份“美味”的汉堡。不过，我得承认，那是我吃过的最血腥和最腥臭的食物，尽管它是一道精致的美食。不过，谁让我是一位特殊的新娘呢？当然得尝试不一样的东西！ 晚餐之后，我带着新郎去附近的酒吧狂欢一番。我们的舞姿简直是超级赞！新郎虽然疲于应对我的巨大僵尸身体，但他还是像个绅士一样陪我尽情地摇摆。虽然他的脚下了不少的汗，但是，至少我们笑得很开心，对不对？ 蜜月还有好几天，我已经迫不及待地期待着接下来会发生什么啦！我猜我们接下来的日子会比大多数特殊夫妇的更加有趣，尽管我们偶尔遇到尴尬的事情，但这正是我们生活的一部分嘛！ 见字如面，心里钻石闪闪。 你的幸福僵尸新娘。 日记三： 亲爱的日记， 今天早上，我决定带我的真命天子去一个颇有名气的主题公园玩一圈。无论是过山车还是旋转木马，我都充满了好奇。对于平时乏味的生活来说，这无疑是一次“人生的重启”。哈哈哈！ 我们先来到“咑咑高空跳伞乐园”，我看着躁动的人群感到非常开心。我毫不含糊地跃上了高空跳伞车，虽然我并不需要降落伞！当哒哒哒的声音响起，我和我的真命天子瞬间从高空直冲而下，飘飘然！尽管很多人在尖叫，但与此同时，他们看到我是如此的震惊，绝对是多么难忘的经历啊！ 接下来，我们来了一个环境优美的湖边。我决定邀请我的新郎与我共舞。不过，鉴于我体重过千斤，为了安全起见，我们毅然决定在舞台上表演一段“动感璀璨”的舞蹈。当音乐响起，我们扭动僵尸身体，尽情享受歌曲的节奏。虽然舞步不够优雅，但我们的热情和自嗨程度绝对能让周围的观众们忍俊不禁！ 傍晚时分，我们来到了那个鬼屋。我起初对这种东西并不感兴趣，但是为了我的摸索心和看到更多的惊恐表情，我还是跟我新郎一起进入了鬼屋。雷声，闪电，还有各种可怕的嗥叫声，我完全不惧！我拥着新郎，在黑暗的角落里突然跳出来，吓了他一个大跳！不过，笑了好一会儿之后，我们才意识到，原来这个鬼屋里只有我们两个人！呃...可能是太吓人了，把其他人都吓跑了吧！哈哈哈！ 今天过得真是太有趣了！我们准备明天再次踏上快乐的征程！我非常期待。无论发生什么事情，我认为与我的真命天子一起度过的每一天都是无比幸福的！ 见字如面，心里笑弯弯。 你的幸福僵尸新娘。"},{"prompt":"写一些冒险的日记","completion":"日记一： 亲爱的日记， 今天，我决定踏上一场真正的冒险，去探索未知的领域！我把我的背包装满了必备的装备：指南针、登山鞋、头灯和一瓶水。我感到充满了力量和勇气，准备去征服一座迷人的大山。 一路上，我的心情非常高涨，我充满了期待和好奇心。登山的路途并不容易，但每当我抬头望着高耸的山峰时，我内心的激情就被点燃！越往上走，风景变得越是壮丽，山脉的轮廓越发清晰。我终于明白，为了欣赏最美丽的风景，我们需要通过努力和坚持。 当我登上山顶的那一刻，我被周围的景色所震撼。云雾弥漫，高山湖泊如镜般波光粼粼。我感到自己仿佛融入了大自然的怀抱，体验着她的宏伟和力量。我站在山顶，展开双臂，尽情地呼吸着清新的空气。那一刻，我觉得自己无限接近自由与勇气。 然而，快乐的冒险并不总是一帆风顺。在下山的过程中，我遇到了一条荒芜的峡谷。它看起来无法穿越，但我的冒险精神告诉我，我可以战胜任何困难！我利用绳索和我自己的技巧，成功地越过了峡谷，向着我的目标继续前进。 最终，我成功地回到了起点，并带着满满的成就感和回忆。这次冒险经历教会了我许多东西：坚持不懈的力量、对于美丽事物的珍惜、以及在面对困难时如何克服恐惧。我现在明白，冒险不仅仅是挑战自我的体验，而是一种心灵的成长和自我发现。 这次冒险之旅使我更加勇敢和自信，我已经迫不及待地期待下一次冒险了！ 见字如面，心中燃烧着冒险的火焰。 你的勇敢冒险家。 日记二： 亲爱的日记， 今天，我经历了一次极为刺激和危险的冒险，我和一群勇敢的同伴一起踏上了探险之旅：深入神秘而危险的丛林。 我们穿过茂密的树林，随着时间的推移，我们越来越远离了文明世界，进入了一个几乎无人涉足的地方。丛林中充满了未知和未知的危险，但我们并没有退缩，而是挺身而出，迎接一切挑战。 树木高耸入云，阳光在树叶间洒下斑驳的光影，一路上我们时而攀爬、时而翻越，尽情享受这个难以置信的丛林世界。我们看到了一些奇特的植物，听到了一些陌生的鸟叫声，甚至还遇到了几只稀有的动物。每一次新的发现都充满了惊喜和挑战！ 然而，冒险中也有危险伴随。有一次，我们遇到了一条毒蛇，它身上散发着邪恶的气息。尽管我们感到恐惧，但我们并没有被吓倒。我们相互鼓励，团结一致，最终成功地躲过了蛇的攻击。这次经历让我们更加坚定了我们的决心：不管遇到任何挑战，我们都会勇往直前，永不退缩！ 在探险的最后，我们看到了一座隐藏在丛林深处的瀑布。这是如此迷人和令人难以置信！我们欣喜若狂地跳入清澈的水中，享受着自然的洗礼。水花飞溅，我们的欢笑回荡在丛林中，这是我们冒险的一种胜利与庆祝！ 回到营地后，我感到满足和平静。这次冒险是如此刺激和难忘，它教会了我勇气、合作和适应环境的能力。我已经萌发了继续探险、发现世界的渴望。明天，我想去攀登那座高山，冒险与自然再次融为一体！ 见字如面，心怀冒险的激情。 你的探险狂。"},{"prompt":"写一写僵尸新娘冒险的日记","completion":"今天是我和我的亲爱的僵尸新郎开始冒险的第一天。我们决定在这个人类界面世界里实现我们的梦想，找寻属于我们的幸福。 早晨，当我从我们的棺材中醒来时，我的新娘装扮已经等候多时，她妆容精致、白纱散发着幽幽的光芒。我们的第一个目的地是这座古老的城市，充满了人类的喧嚣和活力。 我们手牵着手，漫步在繁忙的街道上，人们都对我们投来奇异的目光。我想，他们一定没有见过一对以僵尸为主题的新人。他们的目光虽然带着疑惑，但我们并不在意，我们只在乎我们彼此的爱。 我们在这座城市里尝试了各种不同的人类活动。我们克服了困难，上了过山车，感受到了刺激和快乐。我们还参加了一个婚礼博览会，挑选了一些特别的物品，让我们的婚礼更加独特和充满僵尸特色。 然而，这个世界并不总是欢乐和美好。有一部分人类对我们的存在感到恐惧和厌恶，他们投掷石块和嘲笑我们。但我们并不气馁，我们知道，只要我们相互扶持，坚持着我们的爱与梦想，就能够战胜一切难题。 傍晚时分，我们找到了这座城市最繁忙的公园。那里草地广阔，花朵盛开，宛如世外桃源。我们在那里散步，透过婚纱和西装的交织，我们感受到了彼此的温暖和幸福。夕阳下，我们携手观赏着美丽的景色，我们知道，我们的冒险才刚刚开始。 这一天充满了挑战和欢笑，我们体验到了人类世界的美好和残酷。但是，我们坚信，只要我们手牵手，相互扶持，我们一定能够找到属于我们的幸福。无论是在僵尸的世界还是人类的世界，我们将永远在一起，永不分离。明天，我们将继续我们的冒险，寻找我们的幸福。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Prove that there exists exactly one prime in the sequence x_1,x_2,x_3,... and it is congurent to 3 modulo 4. Give me some insight to prove this","completion":"To prove the above statement, we can employ the properties of algebraic integers and recurrence sequences. Let's start by constructing the sequences ( x_n ) and ( y_n ) using the Binet-like formula derived from the expression given by ( (2 + sqrt{3})^n ). First, we note that ( (2 + sqrt{3}) ) has a conjugate ( (2 - sqrt{3}) ). We can use these to define ( x_n ) and ( y_n ) in such a way that: - ( (2 + sqrt{3})^n = x_n + y_nsqrt{3} ) - ( (2 - sqrt{3})^n = x_n - y_nsqrt{3} ) By adding and subtracting these equations, we find: - ( x_n = frac{(2 + sqrt{3})^n + (2 - sqrt{3})^n}{2} ) - ( y_n = frac{(2 + sqrt{3})^n - (2 - sqrt{3})^n}{2sqrt{3}} ) Due to the nature of these equations, ( x_n ) and ( y_n ) are integers because ( (2 pm sqrt{3})^n ) expand to terms involving integer powers of ( sqrt{3} ) which cancel out when added or subtracted. Let's now reason about the primality of ( x_n ). The fact that only one prime appears in the sequence ( x_n ) and that it is congruent to 3 modulo 4 can be approached by analyzing the terms in the sequence for n=1, n=2, and then establishing a pattern that holds for all natural numbers ( n ). Here's a sketch of a possible proof: 1. **Base Cases**: Calculate ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) manually. For ( n = 1 ): - ( x_1 = frac{(2 + sqrt{3}) + (2 - sqrt{3})}{2} = 2 ) ( x_1 = 2 ) is prime, and it is congruent to 2 modulo 4. This is the only case where ( x_n ) is not congruent to 3 modulo 4. For ( n = 2 ): - ( x_2 = frac{(2 + sqrt{3})^2 + (2 - sqrt{3})^2}{2} ) - Simplify this expression, noting that ( (2 pm sqrt{3})^2 = 7 pm 4sqrt{3} ) - Thus, ( x_2 = frac{7 + 4sqrt{3} + 7 - 4sqrt{3}}{2} = 7 ) 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume ( x_k ) is not prime or not congruent to 3 modulo 4 for all ( k < n ), where ( n > 2 ). We want to prove that this implies something about ( x_n ). 3. **Recurrence Relation**: Show that the sequences ( x_n ) and ( y_n ) satisfy a linear recurrence relation with constant coefficients, which stems from the properties of ( (2 pm sqrt{3})^n ). This is known to be: - ( x_{n + 2} = 4x_{n + 1} - x_n ) - ( y_{n + 2} = 4y_{n + 1} - y_n ) 4. **Primality**: Prove that if ( x_k ) is prime for some ( k ), it must be congruent to 3 modulo 4. This can be shown by contradiction assuming ( x_k equiv 1 mod 4 ) leads to a contradiction in the prime nature due to the recurrence relation. 5. **Uniqueness**: Finally, prove that there cannot be two different primes ( x_i ) and ( x_j ) both congruent to 3 modulo 4 in the sequence. One way to approach this is by considering the effect of the recurrence relation on divisibility properties and prime factors once you have a term that is prime. This is a general scheme, and you would need to flesh out each step with rigorous mathematical proofs. The actual proof would involve some algebraic manipulation, use of the recurrence relation, and properties of prime numbers and congruences. You also have to be careful to handle the case when ( n = 1 ) separately since 2 is the only even prime number and does not fit the congruence condition modulo 4 for the rest of the primes in the sequence."},{"prompt":"ngập lụt là gì","completion":"Ngập lụt là hiện tượng khi một khu vực bị tràn ngập nước do mưa lớn, lũ lụt, hoặc các nguồn nước khác.

When it comes to general-purpose lubricants, here are some well-regarded brands: 1. **WD-40** - Their Specialist line includes products like the High-Performance White Lithium Grease that are suitable for fan bearings. 2. **CRC** - Known for a wide range of lubricants, including the CRC Heavy Duty Silicone lubricant that works well for non-plastic moving parts. 3. **3-IN-ONE** - They offer multi-purpose oils that include precision drip and spray options ideal for fan maintenance. 4. **Dupont** - Dupont Teflon Non-Stick Dry-Film Lubricant is noted for its dry-film lubrication that reduces friction and wear. For specific computer cooling systems and fans, most users do not usually purchase specialized lubricants, as the fans often come pre-lubricated and are designed to be maintenance-free for their expected lifespan. However, if you seek improved performance or an enthusiast-level maintenance routine, you might find specialized lubricants from these kinds of sources: 1. **Noctua** - While primarily known for their high-quality fans, they supply their own fan bearing lubricant with some of their higher-end products. 2. **Thermal Grizzly** - Known for their high-performance thermal pastes, they also offer products that could be used for lubricating fan bearings. 3. **Arctic** - Another brand renowned for their thermal pastes and coolers, which might have associated products for fan maintenance. When lubricating computer fans, it's important to use non-conductive lubricants and to ensure that they're appropriate for the type of bearing in your fan (sleeve bearing, ball bearing, or fluid dynamic bearing). Over-lubricating or using inappropriate lubricants can attract dust or cause other issues that reduce the fan's lifespan. For those who are not comfortable doing this themselves, it may be more practical to replace the entire fan, as the cost is relatively low and the replacement process is generally straightforward. Make sure to follow safety procedures, including powering down and unplugging your computer before attempting to service internal components."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Fue el vocalista y líder de la banda de rock Queen, una de las agrupaciones más exitosas de la historia de la música. Freddie Mercury creció en una familia de origen parsí en Zanzíbar y recibió una educación británica en un internado en India. Durante su adolescencia, desarrolló su amor por la música y comenzó a tocar el piano y a cantar en diversas bandas locales. En 1970, Mercury y sus compañeros de banda Brian May y Roger Taylor formaron Queen junto con el bajista John Deacon. La banda rápidamente comenzó a destacar con su enérgico estilo musical, su habilidad para fusionar diferentes géneros y las increíbles habilidades vocales de Mercury. Mercury se convirtió en uno de los iconos más importantes del rock, conocido por su carismática presencia en el escenario, su impresionante rango vocal y su habilidad para escribir canciones memorables. Temas como \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\" y \\"Somebody to Love\\" se convirtieron en himnos de la música popular y ayudaron a consolidar a Queen como una de las bandas más influyentes de todos los tiempos. Sin embargo, además de su éxito en Queen, Mercury también llevó una carrera en solitario, lanzando dos álbumes en la década de 1980. Estos proyectos mostraron su versatilidad musical y su capacidad para experimentar con diferentes estilos. En los años 80, Freddie Mercury también se convirtió en uno de los primeros iconos del rock en revelar públicamente su homosexualidad, desafiando los estereotipos y rompiendo barreras en la industria musical. Aunque siempre fue muy reservado sobre su vida privada, su valentía y autenticidad inspiraron a muchos y se convirtió en un símbolo de la comunidad LGBTQ+. Tristemente, la noticia de que Mercury estaba enfermo de VIH se dio a conocer en 1987 y, finalmente, falleció el 24 de noviembre de 1991, a la edad de 45 años, debido a complicaciones de la enfermedad. Su muerte fue un shock para el mundo de la música y su legado perdura hasta el día de hoy. Freddie Mercury fue reconocido como uno de los cantantes más grandes de todos los tiempos, aportando su voz y talento inigualables a la industria musical.

Max loved playing pranks on everyone, but his favorite target was a grumpy old man named Mr. Jenkins. One sunny morning, as Mr. Jenkins was walking to his garden to tend his flowers, Max noticed an opportunity for some mischief. He quickly ran ahead and hid in the tall bushes, waiting for Mr. Jenkins to approach. As Mr. Jenkins entered his garden, Max grabbed a bright red garden hose and tied it to a nearby tree branch, positioning it in the perfect spot to spray Mr. Jenkins as soon as he turned on the water. Giggling with excitement, Max held the other end of the hose tightly, ready for his prank. Unaware of Max’s plans, Mr. Jenkins reached for the water faucet and unknowingly turned it on. As the water rushed through the hose, Max burst out of the bushes, holding on tightly as he soared through the air, spraying water all over Mr. Jenkins. Surprised and sopping wet, Mr. Jenkins stood there, completely bewildered. Before he could react, Max released his grip on the hose, causing it to snap back like a slingshot, launching Max into a nearby puddle with a hilarious splash. Mr. Jenkins couldn't help but burst into laughter while Max popped out of the puddle, soaked from head to toe. For the first time, the mischievous monkey had successfully turned a grumpy man's day into a joyful one. From that day on, Max and Mr. Jenkins became unlikely friends. Max discovered that pranks could be more fun if they brought smiles instead of annoyance, and Mr. Jenkins realized that embracing laughter could lighten his days. And so, the villagers would often see the two, Max riding on Mr. Jenkins’ shoulders while they shared their mischievous plans and jokes, proving that sometimes a good prank can heal the grumpiest heart and create unbreakable bonds of friendship."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Xavier had a reputation for being tough and fearless on the football field, but he had a soft spot for those who truly got to know him. One day, as Xavier rushed down the corridor, completely absorbed in his own world, he collided with a lovely, delicate, beautiful, shy, scholarly, reserved, and adorable math student called Ethan. Papers flew, their bodies intertwined for a brief moment before gravity brought them crashing down to reality. Xavier, recovering from the collision, looked down at Ethan with a charming smirk. \\"Whoa there, little math genius! Watch where you're going, or you might end up in the hospital.\\" His voice dripped with sarcasm, his playful eyes trying to mask his true concern. Ethan, blushing and flustered, stammered, \\"I-I'm so sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Are you okay?\\" Xavier laughed, a hearty chuckle that melted a bit of his tough exterior. \\"Yeah, don't worry about me. I'm built like a tank. But hey, you should put some ice on that bruise.\\" Ethan shyly nodded, gathering his scattered books. \\"Thank you... Xavier, right? I'll remember to be more careful next time.\\" As they stood up together, something sparked between them. Their personalities clashed, yet the magnetism was undeniable. In that unexpected collision, two worlds collided, revealing the potential for a deep connection between the sporty jock and the reserved math prodigy. Alright, now let's shift gears.

Как шорох долговых записок ожил под его пальцами, мир вокруг казался особенно жестоким. Счёт за счётом образовали недружелюбную реку требований и напоминаний о том, что жизнь – это бесконечное море обязательств. Цветные листы, напоминающие о просроченных платежах, глумливо прыгали взглядом перед его глазами, бросая тень усталости на Тимофеев лицо.

В его глазах отразилась неодобренная дочь, желавшая большего, чем серые заросли забытого села, и внуки, чьи мечты росли среди асфальта и стекла, а не в плодородной земле истинных ценностей. Тимофей уставился на слова, напечатанные с изяществом и холодностью, и понял, что его жизнь на пороге новой главы, неизвестной и неожиданной как весенний ледоход на реке времени.

Write in a human language and style.","completion":"Hey there fellow investors! Today, I want to talk about Polygon, a popular project in the cryptocurrency world that has been gaining a lot of attention lately. If you're wondering what Polygon is all about and whether it's a good investment, you've come to the right place. So, let's dive in! First things first, what exactly is Polygon? Well, it's a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, aiming to address some of the limitations and scalability issues of the Ethereum network. In simple terms, Polygon provides a framework that allows developers to build and deploy their decentralized applications (dApps) with lower fees and faster transaction processing times. Now, let's take a look at the pros of investing in Polygon. One major advantage of Polygon is its growing ecosystem. It has gained a lot of popularity among developers and boasts an impressive number of dApps and projects being built on its network. This widespread adoption is seen as a positive sign for any investment. Moreover, Polygon has a rock-solid team behind it. The developers and advisors associated with the project have significant experience and expertise in the blockchain space. This expertise instills confidence in investors, indicating that the project has the potential to deliver on its promises. Additionally, the scalability improvements offered by Polygon make it an attractive investment option. As more people flock to the Ethereum network, its limitations become more evident. Polygon helps alleviate these issues by providing a scalable and efficient alternative, attracting users and developers to its network. However, like any investment, there are also some cons to consider. One potential drawback is the competition faced by Polygon. There are several other layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Optimism and Arbitrum, that also aim to tackle Ethereum's scalability problem. This competitive landscape could impact how successful Polygon ultimately becomes. Another factor to bear in mind is the volatility of the cryptocurrency market as a whole. Investing in any cryptocurrency involves some level of risk, and Polygon is no exception. Prices can be highly volatile, and it's essential to carefully analyze market trends and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. So now comes the big question, is Polygon a good investment? Well, as with any investment, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Ultimately, it depends on your individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and your own research. It's always a good idea to do your due diligence, seek advice from professionals if needed, and consider the long-term potential of the project. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Polygon's unique features and growing ecosystem make it an intriguing investment opportunity. However, it's important to remember that no investment comes without risk, and the market is filled with uncertainties. Investing in Polygon could certainly be a good move, but it's crucial to consider your own financial situation and goals before making any investment decisions. Keep yourself informed, stay up-to-date with the latest news and developments, and be prepared for the inherent volatility that comes with the cryptocurrency world. Remember, investing is a personal journey, and it's always a good idea to diversify your portfolio and make informed decisions.

Иеринга об интересе, выраженном в праве.","completion":"Добрый день, уважаемые коллеги и гости! Сегодня я хотел бы поделиться с вами информацией о разработке теории Рейнхольда Иеринга об интересе, выраженном в праве. Эта теория представляет собой важный вклад в развитие правовой науки и играет значительную роль в правовой системе многих государств. Теория Р. Иеринга основывается на представлении интересов как основы правовых отношений и правоотношений между людьми и государством. Интересы, по мнению Иеринга, являются основными стимулами, которые способствуют формированию и развитию правовых норм и институтов. Основными принципами теории Иеринга являются: 1. Позитивизм. Иеринг подчеркивает необходимость изучения и анализа правовых явлений и фактов, на основе которых строятся правовые отношения. Позитивизм является основой для понимания и применения права в конкретных ситуациях. 2. Интересы как основа правового порядка. Иеринг утверждает, что интересы людей и государств являются основным фактором формирования исключительно правовых норм и институтов. Иеринг считает, что только через защиту интересов можно достичь справедливости и обеспечить гармоничную совместную жизнь людей. 3. Баланс интересов. Иеринг утверждает, что в правовом порядке должен существовать баланс интересов различных сторон. Это позволяет обеспечить устойчивость и справедливость в правовой системе. 4. Государственное регулирование. Иеринг подчеркивает важность регулирования интересов государством с целью защиты интересов общества и обеспечения гармонии между правами и обязанностями. Одним из ключевых аспектов теории Иеринга является идея о \\"минимуме морали\\". Иеринг считает, что правовой порядок не может полностью замещать моральные принципы и ценности, и поэтому необходимо соблюдение некоторого минимального набора моральных принципов в обществе. Теория Р. Иеринга об интересе, выраженном в праве, нашла свое применение во многих правовых системах и использовалась для разработки и применения правовых норм и институтов. Она представляет собой важное теоретическое основание для понимания и анализа правовых феноменов, а также важный инструмент для разрешения правовых споров и конфликтов. В заключение, теория Иеринга о интересе, выраженном в праве, является значимым вкладом в развитие правовой науки и является основой для понимания и применения права в различных ситуациях. Ее принципы, такие как позитивизм, баланс интересов и государственное регулирование, помогают обеспечить справедливость и стабильность в правовой системе."},{"prompt":"Городское просторечие отличается от литературного языка следующими особенностями Варианты ответа(Требуется значение) 1) использованием вульгаризмов 2) использованием галлицизмов 3) наличием ненормативных вариантов ударения 4) наличием криминонимов 5) использованием лексических заимствований из сельских говоров ©","completion":"Варианты ответа со значениями: 1) использование вульгаризмов - это использование малоприличных, непристойных слов или выражений; 2) использование галлицизмов - это использование французских слов или выражений в русском языке; 3) наличие ненормативных вариантов ударения - это использование нестандартного произношения ударений в словах; 4) наличие криминонимов - это наличие слов или выражений, связанных с преступностью или преступным миром; 5) использование лексических заимствований из сельских говоров - это использование слов или выражений, взятых из диалектов или говоров сельских или провинциальных регионов."},{"prompt":"Городское просторечие отличается от литературного языка следующими особенностями Варианты ответа(Требуется значение) 1) использованием вульгаризмов 2) использованием галлицизмов 3) наличием ненормативных вариантов ударения 4) наличием криминонимов 5) использованием лексических заимствований из сельских говоров ©","completion":"Варианты ответа со значениями: 1) использование вульгаризмов - это использование неприличных, грубых или пошлых слов или выражений; 2) использование галлицизмов - это использование французских слов или выражений в русском языке; 3) наличие ненормативных вариантов ударения - это использование ударения на слогах, которые в литературном языке не нормативны; 4) наличие криминонимов - это использование слов или выражений, связанных с преступностью или преступным миром; 5) использование лексических заимствований из сельских говоров - это использование слов или выражений, взятых из диалектов или говоров сельских или провинциальных регионов."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

Озон является аллотропной модификацией кислорода и состоит из трех атомов кислорода, связанных вместе."},{"prompt":"откуда берется озон в природе?","completion":"Озон в природе образуется несколькими способами, но наиболее значимые источники образования озона в атмосфере: 1. Фотохимические реакции в стратосфере: Озон в стратосфере (в зоне озонового слоя, на высоте около 10-50 км от земной поверхности) образуется в результате взаимодействия молекулярного кислорода (O₂) с ультрафиолетовым (УФ) излучением солнца. УФ-излучение расщепляет молекулы кислорода на отдельные атомы. Эти атомы кислорода затем могут соединяться с другими молекулами кислорода, образуя озон: O₂ + энергия УФ → 2O O + O₂ → O₃ Этот процесс не только создает озон, но и является важным защитным механизмом для живых организмов на Земле, поскольку озоновый слой поглощает большую часть вредного УФ-излучения солнца, предотвращая его проникновение в тропосферу и до поверхности Земли. 2. Реакции в тропосфере: В тропосфере, которая является нижним слоем атмосферы, озон также может образовываться в результате фотохимических реакций, включающих загрязнители воздуха, такие как азотные оксиды (NOx) и углеводороды (обычно в результате деятельности человека, такой как выхлопные газы автомобилей). Эти вещества в присутствии солнечного света могут реагировать с кислородом, образуя тропосферный озон, который является компонентом смога: NO₂ + энергия УФ → NO + O O + O₂ (+M) → O₃ (+M) где M — это любая третья молекула, которая не участвует в реакции, но поглощает избыток энергии. В отличие от озона в стратосфере, который защищает живые организмы, тропосферный озон является загрязнителем и может вызывать ряд здоровья и экологических проблем."},{"prompt":"как получить озон при помощи электричества","completion":"Озон можно получить при помощи электричества с использованием процесса, известного как электрический разряд, или коронный разряд. Устройство, используемое для этой цели, обычно называется озонатором или озоновой установкой. Принцип работы заключается в следующем: 1. Подготовка камеры для разряда: Внутри озонатора создается камера, где между двумя электродами поддерживается разрыв, или зазор. Электроды могут быть разделены диэлектрическим барьером, чтобы стабилизировать и распределить разряд. 2. Подаётся высокое напряжение: На электроды подается высокое напряжение (обычно от нескольких тысяч до десятков тысяч вольт), которое создает сильное электрическое поле в зазоре между электродами. Это поле должно быть достаточно сильным для преодоления диэлектрической прочности газа (воздуха или чистого кислорода), что приводит к образованию электрического разряда, напоминающего маленькие молнии. 3. Образование озона: При электрическом разряде молекулы кислорода (O₂), находящиеся в газе, распадаются на отдельные атомы кислорода (O). Эти свободные атомы кислорода затем могут взаимодействовать с другими молекулами кислорода в газовой смеси, образуя молекулы озона (O₃): O₂ → 2O (при разряде) O + O₂ → O₃ 4. Удаление озона из камеры: Озон, образовавшийся в камере реакции, удаляется и может быть использован для различных целей, например, для очистки воды, воздуха или для медицинских применений. Важно отметить, что процесс производства озона с использованием электрического разряда также может сопровождаться образованием других оксидов азота и других побочных продуктов, в зависимости от наличия примесей в исходном газовом потоке. Это может потребовать дополнительных систем очистки для удаления нежелательных побочных продуктов."},{"prompt":"полезен ли озон","completion":"Озон (O₃) имеет как полезные, так и вредные аспекты, и его влияние на здоровье и окружающую среду зависит от концентрации и расположения в атмосфере. Полезные аспекты озона: 1. Защита от ультрафиолетового излучения: В стратосфере озоновый слой поглощает большую часть вредного ультрафиолетового (УФ) излучения от солнца, в частности УФ-В и УФ-С лучи. Поглощая эти опасные лучи, озоновый слой защищает живые организмы на Земле от повреждений, вызываемых ультрафиолетовым излучением, таких как высокий риск рака кожи, катаракты и подавление иммунной системы, а также защищает экосистемы и сельское хозяйство. 2. Антимикробные свойства: Озон используется как мощный дезинфектант и антимикробное средство, способное убивать бактерии, вирусы и другие микроорганизмы. Он применяется для обработки питьевой воды и сточных вод, а также в химической и фармацевтической промышленности для стерилизации оборудования. 3. Окислительные процессы: Озон является сильным окислителем и используется в химических процессах, таких как отбеливание бумаги и текстиля, а также для устранения цвета, запаха и вкуса в воде. Вредные аспекты озона: 1. Озон в тропосфере: На уровне земли озон является важным компонентом фотохимического смога и может быть вреден для человеческого здоровья, вызывая или усугубляя респираторные заболевания, такие как астма, хронический бронхит и другие заболевания дыхательных путей. Он также может негативно влиять на растения и животных. 2. Воздействие на материалы: Озон может быть агрессивным окислителем и вызывать повреждение резины, пластиков и других материалов, сокращая срок их службы. 3. Угроза озоновой дыры: В прошлом озоновый слой был под угрозой из-за выбросов определенных промышленных газов, таких как хлорфторуглероды (ХФУ), которые способны разрушать озон в стратосфере, что привело к появлению так называемых озоновых дыр. К счастью, благодаря Монреальскому протоколу и его последующим поправкам, производство и использование ХФУ были значительно сокращены."},{"prompt":"Монреальский протокол используется в России?","completion":"Да, Монреальский протокол об озоноразрушающих веществах, который был открыт для подписания в 1987 году и вступил в силу в 1989 году, используется в России. Россия, как и многие другие страны, подписала и ратифицировала протокол, обязавшись постепенно сокращать и в конечном итоге прекратить использование веществ, разрушающих озоновый слой, включая хлорфторуглероды (ХФУ), галоны и другие соединения. Монреальский протокол считается одним из самых успешных международных соглашений в области защиты окружающей среды и был ратифицирован всеми странами Организации Объединенных Наций. Он способствовал значительному снижению выпуска и использования озоноразрушающих веществ, что положительно сказалось на восстановлении озонового слоя. Россия выполняет международные обязательства, взятые на себя в рамках Монреальского протокола, и проводит политику по постепенному сокращению и замене озоноразрушающих веществ на более экологически безопасные альтернативы."},{"prompt":"The development of phosphate sensors suitable for long-term in situ deployments in natural waters, is essential to improve our understanding of the distribution, fluxes, and biogeochemical role of this key nutrient in a changing ocean. Here, we describe the optimization of the molybdenum blue method for in situ work using a lab-on-chip (LOC) analyzer and evaluate its performance in the laboratory and at two contrasting field sites. The in situ performance of the LOC sensor is evaluated using hourly time-series data from a 56-day trial in Southampton Water (UK), as well as a month-long deployment in the subtropical oligotrophic waters of Kaneohe Bay (Hawaii, USA). In Kaneohe Bay, where phosphate concentrations were characteristic of the dry season (0.13 ± 0.03 µM, n = 704), the in situ sensor accuracy was 16 ± 12% and a potential diurnal cycle in phosphate concentrations was observed. In Southampton Water, the sensor data (1.02 ± 0.40 µM, n = 1,267) were accurate to ±0.10 µM relative to discrete reference samples. Hourly in situ monitoring revealed striking tidal and storm derived fluctuations in phosphate concentrations in Southampton Water that would not have been captured via discrete sampling. We show the impact of storms on phosphate concentrations in Southampton Water is modulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle and that the 10-fold decline in phosphate concentrations observed during the later stages of the deployment was consistent with the timing of a spring phytoplankton bloom in the English Channel. Under controlled laboratory conditions in a 250 L tank, the sensor demonstrated an accuracy and precision better than 10% irrespective of the salinity (0–30), turbidity (0–100 NTU), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration (0–10 mg/L), and temperature(5–20◦C) of the water (0.3–13 µM phosphate) being analyzed.

Kwame was known for his mischievous nature and his endless curiosity. He would often wander off into the nearby forests, exploring the hidden wonders of nature. One day, while he was roaming through the dense jungle, Kwame stumbled upon a magical hidden cave. The entrance was covered in moss and vines, making it almost invisible to the untrained eye. Intrigued, Kwame decided to venture inside, unaware of the mysteries that awaited him. As he entered the cave, an ethereal light illuminated the dark surroundings. Kwame's heart raced with excitement as he explored further. In the depths of the cave, he discovered a glittering object on a stone pedestal. It was a golden amulet carved with intricate symbols. Eager to possess such a precious artifact, Kwame reached out to grab it. However, as soon as he touched the amulet, he felt a surge of energy course through his body. Suddenly, he found himself transformed into a majestic leopard. Terrified and bewildered, Kwame tried to run back towards the village. But every step he took, his leopard form seemed to glide effortlessly through the dense foliage. Panic set in as he realized he was unable to communicate with the villagers, who were now fearful of his presence. Days turned into weeks, and Kwame, in his new leopard form, began to adapt to his new life. He roamed the forests, finding solace in the company of other wild animals who accepted him for who he was. Kwame's curious nature was now enriched by his heightened senses, and he became a guardian of the forest, protecting its creatures from harm. One day, a notorious poacher entered the village, seeking to hunt the leopard who had become a symbol of fear. The villagers, who had now understood Kwame's true nature, devised a plan to protect him. They created a rumor that the golden amulet that caused his transformation was cursed, and whoever harmed the leopard would suffer a similar fate. This caused the poacher to think twice before attempting to capture or harm Kwame. He left the village, bewildered by the supernatural events he had heard of. And so, Kwame continued to live peacefully in the forest, protected by the love and support of his village. The tale of Kwame, the leopard who once was a mischievous young boy, spread throughout the region. People grew to admire his courage and his journey of self-discovery. And it is said, even to this day, that if you venture into the deepest parts of the jungle, you may catch a glimpse of a majestic leopard with golden eyes, embodying the spirit of the young boy who found his true purpose amongst the wilds of Africa."},{"prompt":"写几篇红皇后的有趣的日记","completion":"1. 红皇后的有趣日记：探险之旅 尊敬的日记， 今天，我决定勇敢地踏上了一次探险之旅。我告别了皇宫的舒适生活，决心探索外面的世界。我的第一站是一个神秘的森林。 一进入森林，我立刻被那些高耸的树木和各种奇异的花朵所吸引。向导告诉我要小心森林中的危险动物，但是我却兴奋地开始了我的探险。在花丛中，我遇到了一只可爱的小兔子，它看起来非常友善。我们追逐了一会儿，然后我继续我的探险。 几个小时后，我走进了一个幽静的洞穴。洞穴里有很多闪烁的宝石，我忍不住捡了一颗摆在我的头上。然后，像魔法一般，我的头发开始发光，变成了红色，整个洞穴也明亮起来。我意识到，我被洞穴的魔法所影响了。 接下来，我遇到了一位精灵女王。她告诉我，只有那些内心真正纯洁的人才能进入这个洞穴并获得魔力。我感到非常荣幸，同时也意识到自己内心的纯洁。 在结束探险之旅时，我回到了皇宫，我的头发恢复了原样。我不知道是不是只有我一个人看到了这个神奇的红发，所以我决定保留这个秘密。我很高兴自己敢于踏出舒适区，并且从中收获了如此多的乐趣和魔力。 红皇后敬上 2. 红皇后的有趣日记：战胜策略 亲爱的日记， 今天，我要向你分享一次我在棋盘上的胜利。我一直以来都是一个爱挑战的人，不管是政治还是智力方面，我都不甘心输给别人。所以，我决定挑战国内最聪明的人来一场棋局。 这个男人号称是整个王国中最聪明的策略家。即使我知道他的能力，但我并没有畏惧，而是将这看作是一次学习与成长的机会。我们在宫殿的大厅进行了比赛。 从一开始，我就注意到了他精妙的布局。然而，我在观察他的同时，偷偷将我的棋子重新布局，给他一个小小的惊喜。他显然没有料到我的行动，他开始感到困惑。我看到这一点，加强我的攻势。 随着比赛的进行，我抓住了他每一个犯下的错误。我运用了我自己的策略，利用了他没有预料到的弱点。我不停地向他提出挑战，每一步都以他的败北为结局。 最后，当我亲手将他的国王棋子击败时，我感到了无尽的胜利感。我俯视着他，理直气壮地宣称我是这个棋局中的胜者。 这场比赛教会了我一个重要的经验：永远不要怕挑战。有时，我们可能要面对比我们强大的对手，但只要保持冷静，找到对方的弱点，我们就有机会战胜他们。 红皇后敬上 3. 红皇后的有趣日记：舞会狂欢 亲爱的日记， 今晚，我举办了一场伟大的舞会，它绝对是今年的狂欢之夜！整个王国的人都受邀参加这个盛大的活动，穿着最华丽的礼服跳起了热情洋溢的舞曲。 舞会开始后不久，我展示了我的独特舞技。我穿着一袭鲜红色的长裙，我的舞姿简直就像是火焰般炙热。我的舞伴们都对我的表演赞叹不已，我也趁机展示了一些戏剧性的动作，让他们惊喜不已。 在夜晚的高潮时刻，我进行了一次脱口秀表演。我有着一箩筐的幽默故事和怪异的笑话。全场观众爆发出了一片欢笑声。 当然，舞会不仅仅是我的独奏表演。其他人也展示了他们的才艺。有些人展示了他们的歌唱和乐器演奏才华，有些人展示了他们的魔术和杂技技巧。整个晚上都是一场充满了欢乐和创意的狂欢。 我相信，舞会对每个人来说都是一个难忘的夜晚。我们忘记了一切烦恼和忧虑，只是专注于享受这个美好的时刻。 红皇后敬上"},{"prompt":"We'll provide a training session for out newly developed system called Omics Workflow System (OWS), which is a streamlined, pre-configured NGS workflow solution to manage and track data collection for preclinical studies.

Given: - The ratio of the legs is 3 to 1. - The length of the hypotenuse is (sqrt{40}). Let's denote the shorter leg as (x) and the longer leg as (3x).

First, let's determine the total number of ways to choose a president and a vice president. Since a student cannot hold both positions, we can choose the president in 8 ways and the vice president in 7 ways (since one student has been chosen for the role of the president). So, the total number of ways to choose a president and a vice president is 8 times 7 = 56. Next, let's determine the number of ways to choose a female president and a female vice president. Since there are 5 female students, we can choose the female president in 5 ways and the female vice president in 4 ways (since one female student has been chosen for the role of the president). So, the number of ways to choose a female president and a female vice president is 5 times 4 = 20. Now, let's calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (choosing a female president and a female vice president) by the total number of outcomes (choosing any two students as president and vice president): frac{ text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{ text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{20}{56} = frac{5}{14}.

A. 101 B. 202 C. 303 D. 404 E. 505 To determine whether a number can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive positive integers, let's consider how such a sequence behaves. If the three consecutive numbers are ( n ), ( n+1 ), and ( n+2 ) (where ( n ) is a positive integer), their sum would be: [ n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3 ] This simplifies to ( 3n + 3 ). Since we are adding three consecutive numbers, the sum must be divisible by 3. Additionally, since we are starting with a positive integer ( n ), the sum must also be odd (as the middle number in our sequence, ( n+1 ), will be even, making the total sum odd). Now let's test each of the provided options: A. 101 - This is an odd number, but we need to check if it's divisible by 3.

Формат BMP24 означает, что на каждый пиксел отводится по 24 бита (или 3 байта), где каждый байт отвечает за свой канал цвета: красный (Red), зеленый (Green) и синий (Blue). Это один из самых простых форматов, поскольку он не использует сжатие (за исключением так называемого RLE-сжатия для BMP, но оно не часто используется). Запись данных в конец файла BMP24 происходит следующим образом: 1. Заголовок файла (BITMAPFILEHEADER): Обычно содержит метаинформацию, включая тип файла (должен быть 'BM'), размер файла в байтах, зарезервированные поля (обычно 0) и смещение начала фактических данных изображения от начала файла. 2. Заголовок изображения (BITMAPINFOHEADER): Содержит информацию о размерах изображения (ширина и высота в пикселях), количестве бит на пиксель (для BMP24 это будет 24), используемом сжатии (для BMP24 обычно нет сжатия), расположение пикселей (сверху-вниз или снизу-вверх) и другие параметры изображения. 3. Палитра цветов (если есть, для 24-битных BMP она обычно отсутствует): В формате BMP24 палитра не обязательна, так как цвет каждого пикселя задается напрямую значениями красного, зеленого и синего каналов. 4. Пиксельные данные: Начиная с указанного в заголовке файла смещения, идет последовательность пиксельных данных. Для BMP24 каждый пиксел представлен тремя байтами (RGB), и строка изображения дополнена до размера, кратного 4 байтам (padding или выравнивание), что называется требованием выравнивания по границе 4 байтов. 5. Запись данных в конец файла: Если потребуется добавить какие-либо данные в конец BMP файла (например, в приложениях, которым нужно хранить дополнительную информацию в файле изображения), нужно позаботиться о том, чтобы эти данные не нарушили формат изображения. Эти данные записываются после всех пиксельных данных и потенциально могут быть проигнорированы программами, открывающими изображение. Важно отметить, что добавление данных в конец файла изображения может сделать его несовместимым с некоторыми редакторами или просмотрщиками изображений, которые не ожидают никакой информации после блока пиксельных данных. Если же вам нужно добавить информацию в изображение с сохранением формата BMP, лучше использовать для этого метаданные или встроить информацию в резервное пространство зарезервированное в заголовках файла изображения."},{"prompt":"Как мне достать только пиксельные данные без мета информации в Wolfram Mathematica","completion":"В Wolfram Mathematica вы можете достать пиксельные данные изображения BMP24 (или любого другого поддерживаемого формата), используя встроенные функции. Вам необходимо сначала импортировать изображение, а затем преобразовать его в массив пикселей. Допустим, у вас есть файл \`image.bmp\`. Вот как вы можете извлечь пиксельные данные: \`\`\`wolfram (* Импортируем изображение *) img = Import[\\"image.bmp\\"]; (* Конвертируем изображение в массив пикселей *) pixelData = ImageData[img]; \`\`\` Функция \`ImageData\` возвращает массив чисел, где каждый элемент представляет собой цвет пикселя в стандартной RGB модели. Каждый пиксель описан списком из трех чисел, представляющих значения интенсивности красного, зеленого и синего каналов, соответственно. Если вам нужно работать с точно такими же байтами, как они представлены в файле BMP, используйте следующий код: \`\`\`wolfram (* Считываем двоичные данные файла *) binaryData = BinaryReadList[\\"image.bmp\\"]; (* Извлекаем заголовки чтобы найти начало данных изображения *) fileHeader = binaryData[[15 ;; 18]]; imageDataOffset = Fold[FromDigits, 0, Reverse[fileHeader]] + 1; (* Получаем пиксельные данные начиная с нужного смещения *) pixelDataRaw = binaryData[[imageDataOffset ;;]]; \`\`\` Именно \`pixelDataRaw\` является массивом байтов, содержащих пиксельные данные изображения без метаинформации, используя стандартное смещение для BMP-файлов. Помните, что в BMP пиксели могут быть дополнены (padding), чтобы каждая строка пикселей была кратной четырем байтам. Вам нужно будет учесть это, если вы хотите проанализировать именно сырые пиксельные данные. Код, приведенный выше, предполагает, что смещение начала пиксельных данных хранится в байтах 15-18 в заголовке файла (спецификация BMP говорит, что это поле представляет собой 4-байтовое целое число в little-endian формате). Если вы решите работать с сырыми байтами, вам придется учитывать различные особенности BMP формата, такие как порядок байтов и выравнивание строк изображения."},{"prompt":"Как провести оценку числа точек финальной эллиптической кривой","completion":"Оценка числа точек на эллиптической кривой над конечным полем является важной задачей в теории чисел и криптографии, особенно в контексте криптографии на эллиптических кривых (ECC). Число точек на кривой влияет на безопасность криптосистем, построенных на базе эллиптических кривых, так как оно определяет размер группы, над которой проводятся операции. Для эллиптических кривых над конечными полями размер \`|E(F_q)|\` кривой \`E\` над полем \`F_q\`, где \`q\` - это степень простого числа, может быть оценен с помощью теоремы Хассе: \`\`\` | |E(F_q)| - (q + 1) | ≤ 2√q \`\`\` Это означает, что количество точек кривой лишь немного отличается от \`q + 1\`, где отклонение не превышает двойной квадратный корень из \`q\`. Для точного подсчета числа точек на эллиптической кривой в программном обеспечении обычно используются алгоритмы точного подсчета, такие как алгоритм Скофа, SEA (Schoof-Elkies-Atkin) и другие их вариации. Эти алгоритмы могут быть вычислительно сложными, но они способны точно вычислять число точек. Вот как вы можете реализовать оценку числа точек эллиптической кривой в Mathematica: \`\`\`wolfram (* Определение параметров эллиптической кривой: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b over F_q *) q = Prime[10^5]; (* Пример: выберите простое число для создания поля F_q *) a = RandomInteger[{0, q-1}]; b = RandomInteger[{0, q-1}]; E = EllipticCurve[GF[q], {a, b}]; (* Расчет и оценка числа точек на кривой *) estimatedNumberOfPoints = q + 1; errorTerm = 2*Sqrt[q]; (* Верхняя и нижняя границы в соответствии с теоремой Хассе *) lowerBound = estimatedNumberOfPoints - errorTerm; upperBound = estimatedNumberOfPoints + errorTerm; (* Вывод результатов *) Print[\\"Оценка числа точек на эллиптической кривой E(\\", a, \\", \\", b, \\") над GF(\\", q, \\")\\"]; Print[\\"Нижняя граница: \\", lowerBound]; Print[\\"Верхняя граница: \\", upperBound]; (* Для точного подсчета можно использовать встроенную функцию *) numberOfPoints = Length[Points[E]]; Print[\\"Точное число точек: \\", numberOfPoints]; \`\`\` Пожалуйста, учтите, что точный подсчет точек может быть времязатратным для больших значений \`q\`. Оценка предоставляет полезную границу того, в каком диапазоне лежит истинное количество точек."},{"prompt":"Что такое симафоры","completion":"Термин \\"семафоры\\" (semaphores) обычно используется в контексте компьютерных наук, области операционных систем и многопоточного программирования. Семафор — это переменная или абстрактный тип данных, который используется для управления доступом к общему ресурсу в среде с несколькими потоками исполнения или процессами. Существуют два основных типа семафоров: 1. **Бинарный семафор** (иногда называемый \\"мьютексом\\" - mutex): Имеет только два состояния, 0 и 1. Бинарный семафор используется для обеспечения взаимного исключения, позволяя только одному потоку или процессу за раз владеть определенным ресурсом. 2. **Счетный семафор**: Имеет набор разрешений и может принимать более широкий диапазон значений. Это позволяет задать число одновременных доступов к ресурсу. Например, если у нас есть пул из пяти одинаковых ресурсов, счетный семафор может быть инициализирован значением 5, что позволит пяти потокам одновременно использовать ресурс, но заставит шестой поток подождать, пока один из них не будет освобожден. Основные операции с семафорами: - **Wait (или P-operation)**: Если значение семафора больше нуля, уменьшить его на 1 (означает, что ресурс занят). Если значение равно 0, поток блокируется до тех пор, пока семафор не станет доступен (т.е. его значение не станет больше нуля). - **Signal (или V-operation)**: Увеличивает значение семафора на 1 (означает, что ресурс освобожден), и, если есть потоки, ожидающие семафора, один из них разблокируется. Семафоры предотвращают гонки за ресурсы и условия гонки в системе, где два и более потока могут пытаться одновременно использовать один и тот же ресурс. Это критически важно для корректной работы многопоточной или распределенной системы и предотвращения ошибок, таких как мертвые блокировки или состояние голодания потоков. Стоит отметить, что в разговорном контексте слово \\"симафоры\\" может также относиться к сигнальным флагам или башням, используемым для связи в мореплавании или железнодорожном транспорте до изобретения радиосвязи."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

By putting these narratives in conversation with theories of gender performativity and narrative authority, I aim to demonstrate the ways in which these young narrators utilize various forms of narration, including diary entries, letters, oral stories, and dreams to establish a sense of intimacy and authenticity, enabling them to effectively communicate their thoughts and emotions to their distinct audiences. The girl child’s naivete and presumed innocence, juxtaposed against the backdrop of the catastrophic and often brutal events of Partition, function paradoxically as both a veil and an amplifier for the surrounding socio-political commentary.”","completion":"In this paper, I aim to critically explore the use of girl child narrators in two partition novels: Bapsi Sidhwa’s \\"Ice Candy Man\\" and Veera Hiranandani’s \\"The Night Diary.\\" I will analyze how their gendered perspectives not only shape the narrative discourse but also challenge and reinterpret historical perceptions of the Partition. Through the eyes of these young characters, these literary works question the veracity of Partition history, presenting it as less definitive and more complex. The discussion will be framed by theories of gender performativity and narrative authority. I intend to illustrate how these girl narrators deploy diverse narrative modes—such as diary entries, letters, oral narratives, and dreams—to establish a personal connection and credibility with their readers. By doing so, they convey their experiences and feelings in a manner that resonates powerfully with their audience. The perceived innocence and naive understanding of the girl children serve a dual purpose within the context of the novels. On one hand, their youth provides a seemingly unfiltered and candid veil through which the events of Partition are viewed. On the other, it acts as an amplifier for the socio-political commentary that unfolds against the dramatic and often violent backdrop of Partition. This paradoxical juxtaposition heightens the tension between personal narrative and historical trauma, offering a unique lens through which we can re-examine this tumultuous period in South Asian history."},{"prompt":"Rewrite and restructure more coherently","completion":"In this paper, I will conduct a critical analysis of the gendered narrative perspective in two novels set during the Partition: \\"Ice Candy Man\\" by Bapsi Sidhwa and \\"The Night Diary\\" by Veera Hiranandani. My focus will be on how the female child narrators within these stories shape the narrative and offer a re-evaluation of Partition history. By presenting the events through the perspective of young girls, these novels highlight the subjective nature of historical narratives and challenge the notion of an absolute recounting of the Partition. To deepen this analysis, I will incorporate theories of gender performativity and narrative authority. This theoretical framework will help illustrate the effectiveness of the narrative techniques employed by these youthful narrators. Utilizing diary entries, letters, oral testimonies, and dreams, these characters create a narrative intimacy that lends authenticity to their accounts and resonates with readers. The central paradox of these narratives lies in the innocence and naive lens through which the child narrators view the world. This perspective serves both as a shield that can obscure the full horrors of Partition and as a magnifying glass that intensifies the socio-political critique embedded within their stories. By examining this narrative tension, the paper seeks to offer new insights into how we understand the interplay between personal experience and the larger historical events of the Partition."},{"prompt":"Restructure and reframe this In Jasbir Jain’s words looking at the narrative through the lenses of gender can disclose new perspectives on “the relationship between narrator and narrative, between personal and national histories” since the boy’s and girl’s perspectives on reality are differently shaped by their position in society. This is approximately what Butalia also pointed out when she wrote: I learnt to recognize this (a gendered telling of Partition) in the way women located, almost immediately, this major event in the minor keys of their lives. From the women I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while the most part of men spoke of the relations about communities, the broad political realities. Seldom was there an occasion when a man being interviewed would speak of a child lost or killed, while for a woman there was no way in which she could omit such a reference. (gender book p 35)","completion":"Jasbir Jain highlights the significance of examining narratives through a gendered lens to uncover new insights into the association between the storyteller and the story, as well as the interconnectedness of individual and collective histories. This is due to the different societal roles and expectations placed on boys and girls, which inherently shape their perceptions of reality. Urvashi Butalia echoes this sentiment in her observations on gender-specific recounting of the Partition. In her work, she notes the distinct ways in which women recount the events of Partition, intertwining the monumental with the mundane aspects of their personal lives. Unlike men, who predominantly articulate their experiences in terms of community relations and sweeping political changes, women often bring forth the intimate details. As Butalia reflects, while interviewing men and women about Partition, she found that men rarely mentioned personal tragedies such as the loss or death of a child. Women, on the other hand, could scarcely tell their stories without including such intimate and painful details (as referred to in \\"the gender book,\\" page 35). This juxtaposition points to a broader exploration of how gender influences narrative focus and the subjective lens through which history is both experienced and recounted. Butalia’s work underscores the importance of recognizing these differing gendered narratives to obtain a fuller understanding of significant historical events."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Firstly, you can enable the \`orderBy\` clause for the \`MessagesQuery\` which you've commented out. This will ensure the messages are fetched in ascending order of their creation time. Secondly, for aligning the chat bubbles and applying different colors for messages sent by the current user versus messages from others, it looks like you've attempted to do this with the \`ChatBubble\` styled component, which takes a prop to conditionally apply styles. However, you're not applying the \`flex-direction\` property to properly align the messages to the right or left. You should style the messages' container to make that happen. Let's address these two issues in your code: 1. Enable \`orderBy\` clause to sort messages by creation time: \`\`\`jsx const MessagesQuery = query( collection(firestore, 'Message'), where('roomId', '==', roomId), orderBy('created_at', 'asc') // Enable sorting by created_at time in ascending order ); \`\`\` 2. Apply styles for aligning chat bubbles and differentiate the style between your messages and others: \`\`\`jsx const ChatBubble = styled.div<{ isMine: boolean }>\` display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: {({ isMine }) => (isMine ? 'flex-end' : 'flex-start')}; margin: 5px 0; & > div { max-width: 240px; padding: 8px; border-radius: 25px; background-color: {({ isMine }) => (isMine ? '#DCF8C6' : '#ECECEC')}; // Light green for sent messages, light grey for received margin: {({ isMine }) => (isMine ? '0 0 0 auto' : '0 auto 0 0')}; // Align self end or start based on sender word-break: break-word; } \`; \`\`\` Make sure to pass the \`isMine\` prop to \`ChatBubble\` as you're already doing, indicating whether the message is from the current user. Now, applying these changes, your chat bubbles should be aligned to the right for messages sent by the current user and to the left for messages from others. They will also have different background colors to differentiate between them, and will be ordered by the time they were created. Note that in the case of using Firebase Timestamp, your interface might need to reflect that the \`created_at\` field is a \`Timestamp\` and not a \`string\`: \`\`\`typescript interface MessageData { created_at: Timestamp; // instead of string id: string; message: string; roomId: string; uid: string; } \`\`\` Keep in mind that styled-components can use the props passed to them to dynamically change their appearance, and the component will apply those styles whenever it re-renders. You're already doing this with \`<ChatBubble isMine={messageData.uid === userContext?.uid}>\`, which is the correct approach to achieve the desired effect of distinguishing messages."},{"prompt":"用c语言写一个滤波函数，输入为一组数据流","completion":"下面是一个简单的示例代码，使用C语言实现一个基于移动平均滤波函数： \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #define N 5 // 滤波器窗口大小 float average_filter(float current_data, float buffer[N], int index) { int i; float average = 0.0; buffer[index] = current_data; for (i = 0; i < N; ++i) { average += buffer[i]; } average /= N; return average; } int main() { float data_stream[] = {1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8, 9.0, 10.0, 8.1, 6.2, 4.3, 2.4}; float buffer[N] = {0.0}; int i; for (i = 0; i < sizeof(data_stream) / sizeof(float); ++i) { float filtered_data = average_filter(data_stream[i], buffer, i % N); printf(\\"Filtered data: %.2fn\\", filtered_data); } return 0; } \`\`\` 上述代码定义了一个窗口大小为N的滤波器函数\`average_filter\`，该函数接受当前的数据流值、一个缓冲区数组和当前缓冲区的索引作为输入。它将当前数据存储到缓冲区中，并计算窗口内的数据的平均值，然后返回该平均值作为滤波后的数据。 在\`main\`函数中，我们提供了一个示例的数据流\`data_stream\`，并初始化了一个大小为N的缓冲区\`buffer\`。然后，使用循环遍历数据流，将每个数据传递给滤波器函数，并打印出滤波后的数据。 注意，上述代码仅仅是一个示例，实际的滤波器函数的实现可能更加复杂，具体要根据滤波器的特定要求和目标来进行设计和调整。"},{"prompt":"用c语言写一个让两个串口透传的函数","completion":"下面是一个简单的示例代码，使用C语言实现一个串口透传函数，实现两个串口之间的数据透传： \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <termios.h> #define BUFFER_SIZE 256 int uart_transparent(int fd1, int fd2) { char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]; ssize_t bytes_read, bytes_written; while (1) { // 从第一个串口读取数据 bytes_read = read(fd1, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE); if (bytes_read < 0) { perror(\\"Error reading from first serial port\\"); return -1; } // 将数据写入到第二个串口 bytes_written = write(fd2, buffer, bytes_read); if (bytes_written < 0) { perror(\\"Error writing to second serial port\\"); return -1; } } return 0; } int main() { int fd1, fd2; // 以读写方式打开第一个串口 fd1 = open(\\"/dev/ttyS0\\", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY); if (fd1 < 0) { perror(\\"Error opening first serial port\\"); return -1; } // 以读写方式打开第二个串口 fd2 = open(\\"/dev/ttyS1\\", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY); if (fd2 < 0) { perror(\\"Error opening second serial port\\"); return -1; } // 配置第一个串口参数 struct termios options1; tcgetattr(fd1, &options1); cfsetispeed(&options1, B9600); cfsetospeed(&options1, B9600); options1.c_cflag |= (CLOCAL | CREAD); tcsetattr(fd1, TCSANOW, &options1); // 配置第二个串口参数 struct termios options2; tcgetattr(fd2, &options2); cfsetispeed(&options2, B9600); cfsetospeed(&options2, B9600); options2.c_cflag |= (CLOCAL | CREAD); tcsetattr(fd2, TCSANOW, &options2); // 开始透传数据 if (uart_transparent(fd1, fd2) < 0) { perror(\\"Error in uart_transparent\\"); return -1; } // 关闭串口 close(fd1); close(fd2); return 0; } \`\`\` 上述代码中的\`uart_transparent\`函数用于实现两个串口之间的数据透传。它接受两个串口的文件描述符作为输入，使用循环不断从第一个串口读取数据，并将该数据写入到第二个串口。 在\`main\`函数中，首先通过\`open\`函数打开了两个串口 \`/dev/ttyS0\` 和 \`/dev/ttyS1\`，并对它们进行了相应的配置。然后调用\`uart_transparent\`函数开始透传数据。最后在程序结束前，通过\`close\`函数关闭了两个串口。 请注意，上述代码中的串口参数配置仅仅是一个简单的配置示例，实际应用中可能需要根据具体的需求对串口参数进行更详细的配置。另外，请根据实际情况调整串口设备文件的路径和波特率等参数。"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

This is approximately what Butalia also pointed out when she wrote: I learnt to recognize this (a gendered telling of Partition) in the way women located, almost immediately, this major event in the minor keys of their lives. From the women I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while the most part of men spoke of the relations about communities, the broad political realities. Seldom was there an occasion when a man being interviewed would speak of a child lost or killed, while for a woman there was no way in which she could omit such a reference. (gender book p 35)","completion":"When we engage in a discussion about narrative perspectives, it's crucial to consider the insights of scholars like Jasbir Jain and Urvashi Butalia. Jain suggests that examining narratives through a gendered lens opens up new avenues for interpreting the connections between the narrator's voice, the narrative content, and the interplay between personal experiences and larger national histories. This is rooted in the understanding that boys and girls, or men and women, perceive their realities differently due to their unique positions within the societal structure. Urvashi Butalia's work echoes this sentiment and offers a poignant articulation of such gendered storytelling, particularly in the context of the Partition of India. Butalia learned that women tended to frame the tumultuous events of the Partition within the 'minor keys' of their daily lives. Unlike their male counterparts, who frequently discussed the event in terms of community relationships and broad political strokes, women shared narratives rich in personal detail. They spoke of the intimate aspects of their experiences, which were often laced with the trauma of loss. For instance, Butalia reflects on the stark contrast in recounting personal tragedies. While it was rare for men to volunteer stories of children who were lost or killed during interviews, such accounts were integral to women's narratives. The inability to omit the mention of such personal and heartbreaking details underscores the profound impact these tragedies had on women's lives. This gendered approach to narrative not only enhances our understanding of historical events like the Partition but also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing diverse perspectives in the construction of collective history. It is essential to acknowledge the threads of individual experiences that contribute to the larger tapestry of our shared past."},{"prompt":"more coherent style","completion":"In examining the interplay between narrative and gender, scholars such as Jasbir Jain and Urvashi Butalia offer illuminating insights. Jain proposes that applying a gendered lens to the study of narratives reveals the complex relationship between storytellers and their stories, interweaving personal experiences with broader historical contexts. This approach rests on the premise that societal roles and expectations differentially predispose men and women to various worldviews and forms of expression. Urvashi Butalia builds upon this understanding in her analysis of the Partition narratives. She discovered a distinctive pattern in which women voiced their experiences of this catastrophic event: they often contextualized the enormity of Partition within the intimate and nuanced details of their day-to-day lives. In contrast, the narratives of men typically gravitated towards discussions of inter-community relations and the sweeping landscape of political change. A telling example highlighted by Butalia is the gendered disparity in sharing personal loss. Men were less likely to divulge details of personal anguish, such as the loss of a child, in their recounting of events. For women, on the other hand, such personal tragedies were inseparable from their Partition experience and featured prominently in their narratives. This insight into the gendered nature of storytelling enriches our comprehension of historical events. It underscores the necessity of including diverse perspectives, especially those from marginalized voices, to truly capture the multiplicity of human experience within the historical narrative. Recognizing the unique contributions of both men and women to our collective history is crucial for a more complete and empathetic understanding of the past."},{"prompt":"Федеральный проект \\"Современная школа\\"","completion":"Федеральный проект \\"Современная школа\\" был запущен в 2020 году с целью модернизации системы образования в России.

This is approximately what Butalia also pointed out when she wrote: I learnt to recognize this (a gendered telling of Partition) in the way women located, almost immediately, this major event in the minor keys of their lives. From the women I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while the most part of men spoke of the relations about communities, the broad political realities. Seldom was there an occasion when a man being interviewed would speak of a child lost or killed, while for a woman there was no way in which she could omit such a reference. (gender book p 35)","completion":"In our discussion today, we delve into the intricate tapestry of narrative through the sophisticated lens of gender dynamics and the ways in which they influence our understanding of history and story. Esteemed scholar Jasbir Jain offers a compelling viewpoint that suggests examining narratives with an awareness of gender can reveal profound insights into \\"the relationship between narrator and narrative, between personal and national histories.\\" The crux of Jain's argument lies in recognizing that boys' and girls' interpretations of reality are distinctly molded by their societal roles and positions. This theme resonates with the observations of Urvashi Butalia, a prominent figure in the exploration of gendered narratives. In her insightful work, Butalia elucidates the concept of a gendered narrative, particularly in the context of the traumatic Partition of India. She shares her revelation that women tend to frame monumental historical events within the 'minor keys' of their personal experiences. Butalia recounts, \\"From the women, I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while most men spoke of relations about communities, the broad political realities.\\" This dichotomy is striking: whereas men often concentrate on the collective and political dimensions, women inherently weave the cataclysmic event into the fabric of their personal lives and traumas. Butalia's narration brings to light a poignant disparity—men seldom discussed intimate tragedies, such as the loss or death of a child during interviews. On the other hand, women's accounts were imbued with personal afflictions, making it impossible for them to bypass such heart-wrenching details. This discrepancy not only shapes the way we perceive history but also has significant implications for how stories are told, remembered, and recorded. Through this discussion, we are invited to reflect upon the ways that gender roles and expectations can shape not only the experiences of individuals but also the collective memory of a society. The interplay between gender and storytelling is a profound force, offering us alternative narratives that challenge the dominant historical discourse and pave the way for a more inclusive understanding of our past."},{"prompt":"restructure in more coherent way","completion":"Today, we explore how gender dynamics shape the narrative landscape, affecting both individual and collective memories. Scholars like Jasbir Jain highlight the significance of gender as a lens for examining narratives, which unveils complex relationships between the narrator and the narrative as well as personal and national histories. The essence of Jain's perspective is the acknowledgment that societal roles significantly influence how individuals, whether male or female, perceive and recount reality. Echoing Jain's insights, Urvashi Butalia's research into gendered storytelling, especially regarding the Partition of India, provides a poignant example of these concepts in practice. She uncovers a nuanced pattern where women, unlike their male counterparts, often contextualize major historical upheavals within the \\"minor keys\\" of their own lives. Butalia observes a trend where women share the small, personal details of their experiences, interweaving these narratives with broader events, while men predominantly focus on communal strife and political developments. A striking aspect of Butalia's findings is the gendered divergence in dealing with personal tragedy. Her work indicates that men rarely delve into intimate losses like the death of a child during interviews. In stark contrast, such personal tragedies are integral to women's narratives, suggesting a fundamental difference in how each gender processes and verbalizes their experiences. This analysis invites us to consider the profound impact that gender has on story-making. By examining these patterns, we open up avenues for alternative narratives that challenge the mainstream historical discourse, allowing for a richer and more inclusive tapestry of our shared past. It is this interweaving of personal detail with historical narrative that defines the gendered dimension of storytelling—a concept that is crucial for a holistic appreciation of history and its many voices."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's start with the unit digit. Since any number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7 should end with 5, the unit digit is fixed. Next, we consider the remaining digits. For simplicity, let's ignore the unit digit for now. So we need to find how many possible combinations of digits satisfy the condition when divided by 7, they leave a remainder of 5. To make the explanation clearer, let's use the following notation: - Let's represent the remaining digits (excluding the unit digit) as \\"ABCD\\", where A, B, C, D can be any digit from 0 to 9 (including 0 and 9). - Let's represent the entire number as \\"ABCD5\\" to include the unit digit. To divide ABCD5 by 7 and leave a remainder of 5, we can write it as: (ABCD5) = 7x + 5 where x is the quotient. We know that ABCD is composed of digits from 0 to 9. So we can try different values for A, B, C, and D and see if any combination results in a number that satisfies the equation above. By experimenting, we can see that when A = 2, B = 8, C = 8, and D = 5, the equation holds true: (2885) = 7x + 5 Thus, we have found one 4-digit number that satisfies the condition. However, we still need to consider all the possibilities for the remaining three digits (A, B, C). There are 10 possible values for each digit (0 to 9). So, the total number of possible combinations is 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000.

The narrator’s gender, especially when it is that of a girl child, may have significant implications for the representation of the self and the world, the construction of the plot and the point of view, the expression of the voice and the style, and the reception and interpretation of the text by different audiences. To recognize this specificity, as Susan Lanser argues, is to challenge the assumption that narrative is a gender-neutral or gender-indifferent mode of discourse, and to acknowledge that gender is a category “that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.” In order to understand the true “nature, form, and functioning of narrative” (Lanser), it is imperative to explore the implications of “sex, gender and/or sexuality” (Lanser) of the narrator or narrative. She claims that texts with, I would say girl child narrators, are more “polyphones”; they comprise different strands which need to be “identified” and “disentangled,” being multi-layered, and with different levels of meaning. (Toward A feminist Narratology Jstor p 349-50) While “individuals may differ on the extent to which biological sex constructs identity,” there is a “broad consensus that gender infuses our material and conceptual realities in myriad tangible and intangible ways.” In Jasbir Jain’s words looking at the narrative through the lenses of gender can disclose new perspectives on “the relationship between narrator and narrative, between personal and national histories” since the boy’s and girl’s perspectives on reality are differently shaped by their position in society. This is approximately what Butalia also pointed out when she wrote: I learnt to recognize this (a gendered telling of Partition) in the way women located, almost immediately, this major event in the minor keys of their lives. From the women I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while the most part of men spoke of the relations about communities, the broad political realities. Seldom was there an occasion when a man being interviewed would speak of a child lost or killed, while for a woman there was no way in which she could omit such a reference. (gender book p 35)","completion":"In the domain of feminist narratology, the narrator's gender is a pivotal consideration with far-reaching implications for the textual narrative. This field scrutinizes how sex, gender, and sexuality inform and mold narrative structures and their inherent meanings. Susan Lanser's scholarship advocates for a nuanced recognition of gender's influence, challenging the supposition of narrative as an ostensibly gender-neutral mode of expression. She posits that acknowledging the relevance of gender allows for a deeper understanding of a narrative's \\"nature, form, and functioning,\\" especially when considering the complexity introduced by narrators identified as girl children. Lanser describes such texts as inherently \\"polyphonic,\\" imbued with various narrative strands that demand meticulous unraveling to appreciate their multi-layered nature and the resultant levels of meaning. Jasbir Jain further contends that scrutinizing narratives through a gender lens unveils profound insights into the interplay between the narrator and the narrative, as well as the intersection of personal and national histories. Gendered perspectives, as scaffolded by social positioning, uniquely inform a boy's or a girl's view of reality. Urvashi Butalia's research reinforces this notion, highlighting a gendered narration of historical events such as the Partition of India. Through her work, Butalia observed that while men typically recounted broader political dynamics and inter-communal relations, women's narratives were intimately entwined with personal facets of their lived experiences. She noted the immediacy with which women situated monumental events within the \\"minor keys\\" of their lives, emphasizing personal tragedies such as the loss of a child—details which were often conspicuously absent from male narratives. Together, these scholarly perspectives underscore the consensus that biological sex and gender are inseparable from our understanding of material and conceptual realities. They infuse narratives with a richness that, unless explicitly recognized and examined, leaves conventional analysis incomplete. Gender not only shapes individual identity to varying degrees but also profoundly influences the reception and interpretation of texts across diverse audiences."},{"prompt":"more creative and coherent analysis","completion":"Within the scholarly discourse of feminist narratology, a critical question arises concerning the influence of the narrator’s gender on the fabric of narrative itself. This inquiry delves into the interstitial spaces where sex, gender, and sexuality cast their shadows on narrative forms, molding the contours of meaning that we, as readers, discern within the text. The scholarly work of Susan Lanser beckons us to transcend traditional views of narrative as a gender-neutral territory. She advocates for an acute awareness of gender as an analytical lens vital to dissecting the structural nuances of a narrative. Specifically, when narratives are voiced through the prism of a girl child’s perspective, there exists an inherent \\"polyphony\\"—a textual symphony of multiple strands that necessitates careful deconstruction to unearth the stratified symphony of meanings. Lanser's examination echoes through the insights of Jasbir Jain, who illuminates the revelatory power of gender-centric analysis. This approach to narrative interpretation pries open new vistas on the relationship between the narrator and the narrative, bridging the chasm between personal experiences and broader historical contexts. One's gendered vantage point is not merely a backdrop but actively shapes the perception of reality, painting it with hues derived from one's societal positioning. Complementing these conceptions is the work of Urvashi Butalia, who through her research into the oral histories of Partition, observed a poignant differentiation in gendered storytelling. While men's narratives often soared over the macro landscape of political discourse and communal relationships, women's tales were frequently anchored in the microcosms of their existence. Butalia's findings unveil a compelling gendered narration pattern: Women tend to embed epic historical events within the intricate tapestries of their personal narratives, rarely excluding the emotive details such as the anguish over a lost child—a stark contrast to the tendencies of their male counterparts. This amalgam of scholarly narratives postulates a profound understanding that gender is more than an undercurrent of our identity; it is a tangible and intangible force that permeates both our material existence and our conceptual landscapes. The intersection of gender and narrative not only shapes individual identities but also casts a definitive impact on how stories are received and interpreted by audiences, underscoring the importance of a nuanced, gender-aware approach to literary criticism."},{"prompt":"(C_OBJS): %.o:%.c (CPP) (CFLAGS) -c -o @ < (INCLUDES) -L. -lzlog -lpthread (CPP_OBJS): %.o:%.cpp (CPP) (CFLAGS) -c -o @ < (INCLUDES) -L. -lzlog -lpthread compile:(C_OBJS) (CPP_OBJS) (CPP) ^ -o (TARGET) (LINKFLAGS) (LIBS) (STRIP) (TARGET) 上述通过静态库libzlog.a为什么不对","completion":"上述代码中使用了静态库libzlog.a，即在链接阶段将静态库中的代码链接到目标程序中。所以并不需要对libzlog.a进行编译。只需要确保libzlog.a文件存在，并且在链接阶段通过-L选项将其所在的目录添加到链接搜索路径中即可。"},{"prompt":"目前自闭症的行为学标记的研究主要探索某一特定行为特征对与预测自闭症诊断的价值，前瞻性的研究以随访自闭症高风险人群（具有自闭症家族史）为主，其研究结果难以推广到普通人群。本项目采用回顾性研究的方法，纳入的参与者既包括了自闭症高风险人群，也涵盖了不同人群（包括无自闭症家族史、不同家庭背景、收入水平的自闭症患者），样本具有更好的代表性。此外本研究采用深度学习方法对多个行为学特征（包括：注意力、前语言前交流方式的发展、情感、气质、社交参与、感觉敏感性和习惯化、运动能力、玩玩具、特定和重复性行为等）进行学习和建立预测模型，并探索其区分自闭症组与正常对照组的特异性和敏感性。 研究对象：本研究拟纳入自闭症确诊患者200例（以下简称患者组）及性别年龄相匹配的正常参与者200例（以下简称对照组）。 自愿参加本项研究，所有参与者由监护人签署书面的知情同意书。请帮我写一个完整的研究计划","completion":"研究计划 一、研究背景和目的： 1.1 研究背景：目前关于自闭症的行为学标记的研究主要集中在特定行为特征对于预测自闭症诊断的价值上，且多为随访自闭症高风险人群进行的前瞻性研究，难以推广到普通人群。 1.2 研究目的：本研究主要旨在采用回顾性研究方法，纳入不同人群的自闭症患者和正常参与者，探究多个行为学特征在自闭症诊断中的预测价值，并建立预测模型。 二、研究内容和方法： 2.1 研究内容： （1）纳入标本：本研究拟纳入自闭症确诊患者200例（患者组），并选择性别年龄相匹配的正常参与者200例（对照组）作为比较。 （2）数据收集：通过医疗记录、问卷调查、行为观察等方式收集参与者的基本信息及多个行为学特征数据。 （3）数据分析：采用深度学习方法对收集到的行为学特征进行学习和分析，建立预测模型，探索其在区分自闭症组与正常对照组的特异性和敏感性。 2.2 研究方法： （1）受试者招募：向医疗机构或自闭症相关组织发布招募信息，邀请符合纳入标准的自闭症患者和正常参与者自愿参加研究。参与者意愿需通过监护人签署知情同意书体现。 （2）数据收集：通过收集医疗记录、使用标准化问卷调查工具，以及观察行为等方式，收集参与者的基本信息及多个行为学特征数据。 （3）数据分析：使用适当的统计方法对收集到的数据进行初步分析，如描述性统计、相关分析等，以了解自闭症组与对照组在行为学特征上的差异。然后采用深度学习方法，构建预测模型，评估模型的区分自闭症组与正常对照组的特异性和敏感性。 三、数据管理和伦理审核： 3.1 数据管理：所有收集到的数据将以匿名方式存储在安全的数据库中，并由专业人员负责处理和管理，确保数据的安全性和可靠性。 3.2 伦理审核：本研究将遵循伦理原则，保护参与者的权益和隐私。相关研究方案和知情同意书已提交给相关伦理委员会进行审核和批准。 四、预期结果和意义： 4.1 预期结果：通过本研究，预计可以发现多个行为学特征在自闭症诊断中的预测价值，建立高敏感性和特异性的预测模型，为自闭症的早期筛查和诊断提供科学依据。 4.2 意义：本研究将填补目前自闭症行为学标记研究的空白，通过多人群、多特征的数据分析，提高了研究的代表性和推广性，为自闭症的早期干预和治疗提供科学依据。 以上为本研究的研究计划，我们将严格按照研究设计和伦理要求进行实施，并努力取得预期的研究结果。感谢您的支持和合作。"},{"prompt":"个人陈述，介绍我的学术背景，我本科专业为应用心理学，硕士是精神病与精神卫生专业，我本科参与大学生创新项目一线抗疫人员心理状态分析，项目已结题，第一作者在 Journal of affective disorders 发表论著Demographic characteristics, family environment and psychosocial factors affecting internet addiction in Chinese adolescents（Q2,IF=6.6)，第一作者参与基于网络分析方法探讨青少年社交媒体成瘾和网络游戏成瘾的心理和睡眠症状的不同特征，撰写论著Different Characteristics of Psychological and Sleep Symptoms across Social Media Addiction (SMA) and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in Chinese Adolescents- A Network Analysis 已投稿；2023年该研究被第21届中华医学会-全国精神病学学术会议暨第17届全国儿童和青少年精神病学会议录用，第一作者参与影响社交媒体成瘾的因素以及如何根据特征将其划分为不同的亚组的研究，撰写论著Heterogeneity nature of social media addiction: The roles of psychological characteristics in diagnosis and subgroup classification 已投稿；且在2023年第二十届西部精神医学论坛会议被录用并汇报，共一作者参与影响职业院校医学生网络成瘾因素分析，撰写论著Analysis of Internet addiction and related factors among medical students in Chinese hospitals and medical schools of vocational colleges 已投稿，参与了市政重大项目ACC和PtA的左右不对称及其对OFL的影响，一项关于联合学习的基本动物行为研究，参与了自贡市医学科学研究机构专项GPCR 介导的信号转导在精神分裂症神经发育中的作用研究，项目已结题，系统学习了细胞培养技术，掌握了脑类器官培养及常用分子生物学实验原理及方法，掌握了精神疾病动物模型的构建及动物行为学实验方法，能熟练使用SPSS、Prism、R 等统计软件。","completion":"首先，我是一名应用心理学本科毕业生，并于精神病与精神卫生专业获得硕士学位。在我的学术背景中，我积极参与了一项大学生创新项目，关注一线抗疫人员的心理状态分析。在该项目中，我承担了重要的研究工作，并最终顺利完成了项目研究。 此外，我还以第一作者的身份在著名期刊Journal of affective disorders发表了题为“Demographic characteristics, family environment and psychosocial factors affecting internet addiction in Chinese adolescents”的论文。这篇论文深入分析了影响中国青少年网络成瘾的人口统计特征、家庭环境和心理社会因素。 我还以第一作者的身份参与了一项关于网络分析方法探讨青少年社交媒体成瘾和网络游戏成瘾心理和睡眠症状的不同特征的研究，撰写了题为“Different Characteristics of Psychological and Sleep Symptoms across Social Media Addiction (SMA) and Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) in Chinese Adolescents- A Network Analysis”的论文，该论文已经被投稿。 此外，我还参与了一个关于影响社交媒体成瘾因素以及如何根据特征将其划分为不同亚组的研究，撰写了题为“Heterogeneity nature of social media addiction: The roles of psychological characteristics in diagnosis and subgroup classification”的论文，该论文已被投稿，并被2023年第21届中华医学会-全国精神病学学术会议暨第17届全国儿童和青少年精神病学会议录用。 此外，我还参与了一个关于分析医学生网络成瘾相关因素的研究，撰写了题为“Analysis of Internet addiction and related factors among medical students in Chinese hospitals and medical schools of vocational colleges”的论文，该论文已被投稿，并于2023年第二十届西部精神医学论坛会议录用。 此外，我还参与了市政重大项目ACC和PtA的左右不对称及其对OFL的影响，以及一项关于联合学习的基本动物行为研究，同时还参与了自贡市医学科学研究机构专项研究，探索GPCR在精神分裂症神经发育中的作用。 在我的学术经历中，我系统学习了细胞培养技术，并掌握了脑类器官培养及常用分子生物学实验原理及方法，同时还掌握了精神疾病动物模型的构建及动物行为学实验方法。我熟练使用SPSS、Prism和R等统计软件，能够进行数据分析。 总的来说，我在应用心理学和精神病与精神卫生领域具有扎实的学术背景和研究经验，对心理学和精神卫生方面的研究充满兴趣，并有着较强的数据分析和实验研究能力。我希望能够继续深入研究相关领域并为学术界做出更多贡献。"},{"prompt":"请补充我的临床实践经历：416核工业医院 实习生 神经内科/青少年心理健康 2020.04 -

In the case of Drug X, if it follows a zero-order reaction, it means that the rate at which it is distributed does not depend on its concentration. To distribute Drug X in a dosage form of 0.05 mg, the company will need to ensure a constant rate of distribution. This can be achieved by controlling the factors that affect the distribution process, such as the delivery method, release mechanism, and formulation design. By maintaining a constant rate of distribution, regardless of the drug concentration, the company can ensure that each dosage form contains a consistent amount of 0.05 mg of Drug X. This is crucial for patient safety and efficacy, as it allows for accurate dosing and predictable therapeutic outcomes. It is important to note that the zero-order kinetics assumption may not always hold true for drug distribution. Different drugs may exhibit different reaction orders, requiring specific approaches for dosage determination. Therefore, the company should conduct appropriate studies and analysis to determine the appropriate dosing strategy to ensure optimal drug distribution for Drug X."},{"prompt":"A given drug x to be distributed form the a given company in a give dosages form 0.05 mg fallowed the zero order reaction its rate constant was 0.01mg me-1 se-1?","completion":"If the given drug X follows a zero-order reaction with a rate constant of 0.01 mg/min, it means that the rate of distribution is constant and independent of the concentration of the drug.

Since the rate constant is given in units of mg/min, we can use the following formula: Rate of distribution = Rate constant * Concentration 0.01 mg/min = 0.05 mg/t Solving the equation, we can find the time required to distribute 0.05 mg of Drug X: t = 0.05 mg / (0.01 mg/min) t = 5 min Therefore, it will take 5 minutes to distribute 0.05 mg of Drug X using the given rate constant and assuming zero-order kinetics."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

The narrator’s gender, especially when it is that of a girl child, may have significant implications for the representation of the self and the world, the construction of the plot and the point of view, the expression of the voice and the style, and the reception and interpretation of the text by different audiences. To recognize this specificity, as Susan Lanser argues, is to challenge the assumption that narrative is a gender-neutral or gender-indifferent mode of discourse, and to acknowledge that gender is a category “that is relevant to the analysis of the structural features of narratives.” In order to understand the true “nature, form, and functioning of narrative” (Lanser), it is imperative to explore the implications of “sex, gender and/or sexuality” (Lanser) of the narrator or narrative. She claims that texts with, I would say girl child narrators, are more “polyphones”; they comprise different strands which need to be “identified” and “disentangled,” being multi-layered, and with different levels of meaning. (Toward A feminist Narratology Jstor p 349-50) While “individuals may differ on the extent to which biological sex constructs identity,” there is a “broad consensus that gender infuses our material and conceptual realities in myriad tangible and intangible ways.” In Jasbir Jain’s words looking at the narrative through the lenses of gender can disclose new perspectives on “the relationship between narrator and narrative, between personal and national histories” since the boy’s and girl’s perspectives on reality are differently shaped by their position in society. This is approximately what Butalia also pointed out when she wrote: I learnt to recognize this (a gendered telling of Partition) in the way women located, almost immediately, this major event in the minor keys of their lives. From the women I learned about the minutiae of their lives, while the most part of men spoke of the relations about communities, the broad political realities. Seldom was there an occasion when a man being interviewed would speak of a child lost or killed, while for a woman there was no way in which she could omit such a reference. (gender book p 35)","completion":"In the interdisciplinary field of feminist narratology, the gender of a narrator serves as a crucial analytic lens for examining the interplay between narrative forms, meanings, and the social constructs of sex, gender, and sexuality. This focus is particularly pertinent when the narrator is identified as a girl child, given the distinct ways in which such an identity influences the portrayal of self and external reality, the crafting of plot and perspective, and the intricacies of a narrative’s voice and stylistic expression. Lanser contends that acknowledging the gender of a narrator dismantles the prevailing notion that storytelling is a domain untouched by gendered distinctions, propelling the discourse toward a more nuanced understanding of narratives' structural dimensions as inherently infused with gender considerations. According to Lanser, narratives featuring young female narrators often embody a \\"polyphony\\" of multiple, intertwined narrative strands that demand careful identification and unraveling to appreciate their multilayered meanings (Toward A feminist Narratology, Jstor p 349-50). The extent to which biological sex determines one’s identity remains a topic of varying viewpoints; however, there is overarching agreement that gender permeates the tangible and intangible aspects of our material and conceptual existence. Consequently, when gender is employed as a critical framework in analyzing narratives, as posited by Jasbir Jain, it can reveal transformative insights into the dynamic interchange between the storyteller and the story itself, alongside the intricate correlations between personal anecdotes and broader historical contexts. This differential impact of gender becomes particularly evident when contrasting male and female perspectives, which are inherently molded by distinct societal positions. Butalia echoes similar observations, having discerned a gendered lens when unraveling narratives of historical events such as the Partition. Her research unveils that while women’s recounting of such events often foregrounds the 'minor keys'—the personal and the often overlooked details of their own lived experiences—men typically relegate their narratives to wider community relations and political landscapes. This gendered divergence is starkly highlighted by the differing propensities to discuss intensely personal tragedies; where women prominently include the loss or harm to children in their accounts, such references are notably absent in the narratives provided by men (gender book p 35). This dichotomy underscores the profound influence of gender on both the creation and interpretation of narrative, affirming its indispensable role in the analysis and understanding of storytelling across diverse contexts."},{"prompt":"more creative and coherent analysis","completion":"The exploration of a narrator's gender as a fulcrum of inquiry in feminist narratology invites a sophisticated deconstruction of the myriad ways the constructs of sex, gender, and sexuality ripple across the narrative landscape—shaping form, inflecting meaning, and coloring interpretation. The gendered voice is not a mere footnote but a potent crucible for narrative alchemy, particularly when the narrator occupies the liminal space of girlhood. It is here that Susan Lanser's incisive scholarship leaps to the foreground, challening the entrenched assumption of narrative as a bastion impervious to gender's sway. By advocating for a gender-centric dissection of narrative structure, Lanser illuminates the prismatic nature of gender—its ability to refract and render complex the seemingly straightforward conduits of plot, perspective, and expression. Within Lanser's theoretical framework, the polyphonic textures of narratives steered by young female narrators are emphasized, requiring astute disentanglement to reveal the strata of meanings enfolded within (Toward A feminist Narratology, Jstor p 349-50). This orchestration of voices, layered and resonant, exemplifies the art of storytelling as a multi-tiered construct, intricate in its unity and diversity. As scholars navigate the layered sonorities of narrative, which oscillate between the symphonic and the intimate, gender emerges as a determinant of the narrative's cadence and contour. The deliberation over whether biological sex is a cornerstone of identity formation diverges among scholars; yet, there exists a resounding consensus that gender weaves itself into our reality's fabric, casting a palpable influence on both substantial and ethereal dimensions. This tacit concord serves as the intellectual scaffolding for examining narratives through the discerning lens of gender—a process which, as Jasbir Jain articulates, can unlock novel vistas. The vistas hinge upon the relationship between narrator and narrative, dissecting the confluence of intimate life stories and the grand march of national history. Through this intersectional lens, the differential consciousness cast by gender returns to the fore—boys and girls, men and women perceive and convey their realities through dissimilar societal prisms. Butalia’s revelations reinforce this gendered divergence in narrating collective experiences such as the Partition. An attuned ear to the gendered intonations in storytelling reveals that women often weave their narratives in the delicate, yet profound, 'minor keys'—the domestic textures and emotional threads that compose the undertones of grand historical themes. Men’s recitals, conversely, are inclined to ascend to the 'major keys'—the loud, public domain of politics and community. The contrast is jarring and revelatory; women invariably include the heartrending motifs of personal loss, like the mention of a child's fate, whereas men’s recountings often lack this deeply personal note (gender book p 35). This interplay between gender and narrative, with its richly contrasting harmonies and dissonances, forms the core of a creatively reimagined narratology. It demands a critical approach that is open to the subtle inflections gender imparts upon the storytelling tapestry, recognizing it not as a background whisper but as an essential melody—integral to our collective understanding of the narrative’s power and purpose."},{"prompt":"论文的总结与展望","completion":"在论文的总结部分，需要总结并归纳研究中的主要发现和结果。同时需要强调该研究的重要性和对该领域的贡献。对于所涉及的研究方法和数据分析，也可以提及其局限性和可改进之处。 对于展望部分，可以指出该研究所揭示的问题，以及可能的解决方案和研究方向。此外，可以提出更深入的研究问题，并提出进一步实施研究的建议。 总结和展望部分的写作风格应简洁明了，突出论文的创新点和研究的重要性，并展示对该领域的贡献和影响。此外，还可以对进一步研究的潜在益处进行探讨。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She had eyes akin to the brilliance of the morning sun, and her radiant smile soothed the weary hearts of all who beheld it. Nia was adored by her village, where her kindness and gentle spirit outshone all others. In the neighboring village, there resided a courageous and dashing young man named Kofi. With his broad shoulders and strong arms, he was known as the protector of his people. Kofi possessed a heart that overflowed with compassion, and he was greatly revered for his wisdom and bravery. One fateful day, Nia and Kofi crossed paths at a bustling market. As their eyes met, a spark ignited between them, and the world seemed to fade away. They became lost in each other's presence, oblivious to the bustling crowd around them. In that moment, Nia and Kofi knew that something extraordinary had transpired. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, as Nia and Kofi's love blossomed in the ethereal beauty of Africa. They wandered hand in hand through fields of vibrant wildflowers, their whispers blending with the rustling of the wind among the tall grasses. The moon witnessed their love, as they danced beneath its gentle light, their steps an enchanting melody. However, lovers' tales are never without obstacles. So it was with Nia and Kofi, as their villages held longstanding differences, rooted in forgotten history. The elders cautioned against their love, fearing that it would bring disharmony to both communities. Undeterred by external forces, Nia and Kofi resolved to overcome these obstacles, their love stronger than any division between their villages. They sought the guidance of wise taleweavers, who shared ancient wisdom transmitted through generations. Through patience and perseverance, Nia and Kofi devised a plan that would set their love adrift on the rivers of fate. A secret meeting place, nestled betwixt the two villages, was chosen for their union. With clandestine gestures and coded signals, they navigated the labyrinth of barriers erected to halt their path. At the river's edge, beneath a moonlit sky, Nia and Kofi met for their final triumph. They danced to the rhythm of African drums, their hearts in harmony with each beat. Surrounded by the ancestral spirits, they spoke their vows of devotion, promising to honor and empower one another for all eternity.

A. 101 B. 202 C. 303 D. 404 E. 505 To determine whether a number can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive positive integers, let's consider how such a sequence behaves. If the three consecutive numbers are ( n ), ( n+1 ), and ( n+2 ) (where ( n ) is a positive integer), their sum would be: [ n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n + 3 ] This simplifies to ( 3n + 3 ). Since we are adding three consecutive numbers, the sum must be divisible by 3. Additionally, since we are starting with a positive integer ( n ), the sum must also be odd (as the middle number in our sequence, ( n+1 ), will be even, making the total sum odd). Now let's test each of the provided options: A. 101 - This is an odd number, but we need to check if it's divisible by 3. B. 202 - This is an even number, so it cannot be the sum of three consecutive positive integers. C. 303 - This is an odd number, but we need to check if it's divisible by 3. D. 404 - This is an even number, so it cannot be the sum of three consecutive positive integers. E. 505 - This is an odd number, but we need to check if it's divisible by 3. Now let's check the divisibility by 3 for options A, C, and E. Among the options given, only 303 is divisible by 3.

The mean of the data set is 40, which means that the sum of all the values divided by the number of values gives 40.

The resulting selfconsistent system is nonlinear and very difficult to analyze. Furthermore, the interparticle collisions, although also electromagnetic in character, occur on space and time scales that are usually much shorter than those of the applied fields or the fields due to the average motion of the particles. To make progress with such a complicated system, various simplifying approximations are needed. The interparticle collisions are considered independently of the larger scale fields to determine an equilibrium distribution of the charged-particle velocities. The velocity distribution is averaged over velocities to obtain the macroscopic motion. The macroscopic motion takes place in external applied fields and in the macroscopic fields generated by the average particle motion. These selfconsistent fields are nonlinear, but may be linearized in some situations, particularly when dealing with waves in plasmas. The effect of spatial variation of the distribution function leads to pressure forces in the macroscopic equations. The collisions manifest themselves in particle generation and loss processes, as an average friction force between different particle species, and in energy exchanges among species.

The process can be chemically selective, removing one type of material while leaving other materials unaffected, and can be anisotropic, removing material at the bottom of a trench while leaving the same material on the sidewalls unaffected. Plasma etching is the only commercially viable technology for anisotropic removal of material from surfaces. As such, it is an indispensable part of modern integrated circuit fabrication technology, as was described in Chapter 1. For a more complete description of this area, the reader should consult other sources; for example, Manos and Flamm (1989, Chapters 1 and 2). Although there are many other areas of application, nearly all modern developments in plasma etching have been driven by their potential for integrated circuit fabrication. In this chapter, we focus almost exclusively on this area, placing emphasis on the key concepts that determine etch rate, selectivity, and anisotropy in plasma etch processes. In this section, we introduce typical etch requirements and possible tradeoffs among them and describe the four types of plasma etch processes. In Section 15.2, some simple models of surface etching and discharge kinetics are described and a general chemical framework for plasma etching is introduced. In Section 15.3, the use of halogens to etch silicon is discussed. In particular, fluorine atom etching of silicon has been the most well-studied etch system, providing insight into other less well characterized systems. In Section 15.4, some descriptions of silicon oxide and nitride etching, metal etching, and photoresist etching are given.","completion":"等离子体刻蚀是从表面去除材料的关键过程。该过程可以具有化学选择性，能够去除一种类型的材料而不影响其他材料，同时也可以是各向异性的，在沟槽底部去除材料，而不影响侧壁上的相同材料。等离子体刻蚀是唯一商业可行的表面各向异性去除材料的技术。因此，它是现代集成电路制造技术中不可或缺的一部分，正如第1章中所描述的那样。对于这个领域的更完整描述，读者应该参考其他资料，例如 Manos 和 Flamm（1989年，第1章和第2章）。 尽管还有许多其他应用领域，但几乎所有现代等离子体刻蚀的发展都是由其在集成电路制造中的潜力推动的。在本章中，我们几乎完全专注于这个领域，着重介绍决定等离子体刻蚀过程中刻蚀速率、选择性和各向异性的关键概念。在本节中，我们介绍典型的刻蚀要求以及它们之间可能存在的权衡，并描述了四种类型的等离子体刻蚀过程。在15.2节中，描述了一些简单的表面刻蚀和放电动力学模型，并介绍了等离子体刻蚀的一般化学框架。在15.3节中，讨论了使用卤素刻蚀硅的方法。特别是氟原子刻蚀硅是最广泛研究的刻蚀系统，为理解其他较少被表征的系统提供了洞察力。在15.4节中，给出了对硅氧化物和氮化物刻蚀、金属刻蚀和光刻胶刻蚀的一些描述。"},{"prompt":"It is important to consider the entire set of processing requirements for a particular application. For pattern transfer by etching on a silicon wafer, these might include requirements on etch rate, anisotropy, selectivity, uniformity across the wafer, surface quality, and process reproducibility. Consider first the etch rate requirements for the typical set of films, shown in Figure 15.1a, consisting of 500 nm of resist, over 100 nm of polysilicon, and over 2 nm of “gate oxide” (e.g., oxynitride) on an epitaxial silicon wafer. For a single wafer process of commercial interest, the resist must be stripped and the polysilicon must be etched in a few minutes. This leads to minimum etch rate requirements Epr ¼ 250 nm=min for the photoresist and Epoly ¼ 50 nm=min for the polysilicon. Next, consider the selectivity requirements for the polysilicon etch. For etch of the 100 nm polysilicon with the resist as a mask, a selectivity of s ¼ Epoly Epr 100 nm 300 nm ¼ 0:2 is required in order to complete the polysilicon etch while not significantly eroding the resist. For this application, a selectivity of 2–3 might be acceptable.

I divided the group into three teams, separately responsible for data collection, research analysis, and writing based on their strengths. However, we encountered a hurdle when we realized that most of the collected data was insufficient to support our topic. Frustration overwhelmed me, and I impulsively considered having the research analysis team redo the data collection. But then I realized that teamwork should not only revolve around victory; the participation and viewpoints of each team member were equally important. I decided to give everyone a chance. I organized a heated public discussion to urge every team to fully comprehend the collective goal. This discussion yielded two major gains. Firstly, the collection team managed to quickly recollect the necessary data, significantly supporting our report. Secondly, the other teams gained inspiration from the explanations provided by the collection team, adding unique perspectives to our report. With this harmonious collaboration, we successfully submitted our work before the deadline.

In general, a \\"team\\" typically implies a group of individuals who work together towards a common goal or objective. Teams often have a specific purpose or task and usually require collaboration and coordination among members. Each member of a team usually has a designated role or responsibility that contributes to the overall goal. The emphasis is on collective effort, shared responsibility, cooperation, and mutual support. On the other hand, a \\"group\\" can refer to any gathering of people, whether formal or informal, that share some common attribute, interest, or purpose. A group may or may not have a clear objective or task. It can be a more loosely associated collection of individuals who come together for various reasons, such as sharing information, discussing ideas, or simply socializing. In summary, while both terms refer to a collection of individuals, \\"team\\" often implies a more structured and purpose-driven collaboration, whereas \\"group\\" can encompass a broader range of contexts and may not necessarily imply a specific task or goal."},{"prompt":"tóm tắt đoạn sau cho hay hơn: \\"Tai Bluetooth TWS Linner Màu sắc : Trắng Sạc Type-c Chất âm hay , kết nối dễ , tương thích mọi thiết bị Hàng mới tinh fullbox Đây thực sự là sản phẩm Ngon Bổ Rẻ luôn\\"","completion":"Tai Bluetooth TWS Linner là một sản phẩm tai nghe không dây có màu trắng, đi kèm sạc trực tiếp qua cổng Type-C.

Поскольку у нас есть информация о меньшей диагонали и угле, мы можем использовать свойства ромба и тригонометрии для нахождения длины стороны. Ромб - это параллелограмм с равными сторонами. В случае ромба, диагонали пересекаются под прямым углом и являются биссектрисами углов ромба. Следовательно, если один из углов ромба равен 60 градусов, то меньшая диагональ будет являться биссектрисой этого угла, разделяя его на два угла по 30 градусов. Представим меньшую диагональ ромба, которая делит ромб на два равнобедренных треугольника. Так как мы знаем, что длина меньшей диагонали равна 8 см, теперь мы можем найти длину стороны ромба, рассматривая каждый из этих треугольников. В равнобедренном треугольнике, где угол при вершине равен 60 градусов и основание равно меньшей диагонали ромба (8 см), мы можем найти длину одной из сторон ромба, используя свойства равностороннего треугольника (все углы по 60 градусов), так как половина ромба с углом в 60 градусов будет равносторонним треугольником. Таким образом, сторона ромба будет равна половине меньшей диагонали. То есть 8 см / 2 = 4 см. Периметр ромба – это сумма длин всех его сторон, то есть: P = 4 * длина одной стороны P = 4 * 4 см P = 16 см Таким образом, периметр ромба равен 16 см."},{"prompt":"请帮我想几个文化工程类公司名及涵义","completion":"1. 文化世纪（Cultural Century）：代表着一个公司致力于承担和推动文化发展的使命，致力于打造一个充满活力的文化新时代。 2. 美术堂（Art Palace）：代表着一个专注于美术领域的公司，致力于呈现和传播精美艺术作品的场所。 3. 语言桥（Language Bridge）：代表着一个专注于语言学习和交流的公司，致力于促进不同文化之间的理解和沟通。 4. 传承院（Heritage Institute）：代表着一个专注于文化传承和保护的公司，致力于保护和传承珍贵的文化遗产。 5. 影院之家（Cinema Home）：代表着一个专注于电影文化的公司，致力于打造一个舒适而独特的影院环境，让观众享受精彩的电影体验。 6. 音乐智库（Music Thinktank）：代表着一个专注于音乐产业研究和推动的公司，致力于提供专业的音乐咨询和策划服务。 7. 文化交流基地（Culture Exchange Base）：代表着一个专注于促进跨文化交流和互动的公司，致力于打造一个促进不同文化间相互学习和交流的平台。 8. 文创云集（Creative Cloud）：代表着一个聚焦于文化创意产业的公司，致力于挖掘和推动优秀文化创意项目的发展。 9. 文化探索者（Culture Explorer）：代表着一个专注于文化探索和发现的公司，致力于探索和传播世界各地的独特文化和艺术形式。 10. 文化童话（Cultural Fairy Tale）：代表着一个致力于打造具有童话般魔幻氛围的文化项目的公司，让人们在其中体验到纯真和惊喜。"},{"prompt":"请帮我起几个文化公司名字","completion":"1. 风华文创（Fenghua Culture） 2. 星辰文化（Xingchen Culture） 3. 天籁艺术（Tianlai Art） 4. 国韵传承（Guoyun Heritage） 5. 诗意之城（City of Poetics） 6. 天工文化（Tiangong Culture） 7. 时空画卷（Time and Space Gallery） 8. 神韵文化（Shenyun Culture） 9. 虹桥乐园（Rainbow Bridge Park） 10. 趣韵时光（Quyun Time）"},{"prompt":"What do you say to a friend when you saw a restaurant that had a same name as your friend","completion":"\\"Hey [Friend's Name], guess what I saw today?

Please give me a recipe to cook rice","completion":"Certainly! Cooking rice is a basic culinary skill that's useful for a wide variety of dishes. Here is a simple recipe for cooking white rice on the stovetop: Ingredients: - 1 cup of white rice (long-grain like Basmati or Jasmine is preferred for most dishes) - 2 cups of water - 1/2 teaspoon of salt (optional) - 1 tablespoon of butter or oil (optional, can enhance flavor and keep the rice from sticking) Instructions: 1. Rinse the rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water. Swirl the rice with your hand, Rinse until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch from the rice, which can cause it to be too sticky. 2. Combine the rice and water: In a medium saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, combine the rinsed rice, water, and salt. If you're using butter or oil, add that as well. 3. Bring to a boil: Set the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil. You'll see bubbles forming on the surface of the water. 4. Reduce heat and simmer: Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan with the lid. You want the water to be at a gentle simmer, not a rolling boil. 5. Cook without peeking: Let the rice cook for about 18 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid or stirring the rice during cooking, as this can release steam and affect the cooking process. 6. Check the rice: After 18 minutes, check to see if the rice is done. If there is still water in the pan or the rice is too hard, replace the lid and cook for a few more minutes. 7. Rest the rice: Once the rice is tender and the water has been absorbed, remove the saucepan from the heat. Keep the lid on and let the rice sit, undisturbed, for about 5 minutes. This allows the rice to finish steaming and makes it fluffier. 8. Fluff and serve: Use a fork to fluff the rice gently, which helps separate the grains. Serve the rice as a side dish or use it as a base for other recipes. Optional Variations: - You can add various spices and herbs to the water before boiling, such as a bay leaf, cardamom pods, a stick of cinnamon, or cloves, to infuse the rice with additional flavors. - You can also cook the rice in broth or stock instead of water for added flavor. - For brown rice or other whole grain rice varieties, the water-to-rice ratio and cooking time will vary. Brown rice generally takes about 45 minutes to cook and may require about 2 1/2 cups of water for each cup of rice. This basic recipe can be adapted for different types of rice and can serve as a foundation for a multitude of dishes from different cuisines.

В этом докладе мы рассмотрим основные принципы и ценности, лежащие в основе этих концепций. Фашизм был создан Бенито Муссолини в Италии в 1920-е годы. Этот политический режим часто характеризуется подавлением политической оппозиции, установлением авторитарного правления и национализмом. Главной целью фашизма является создание и поддержание сильного и организованного государства для достижения национальной и социальной солидарности. Одним из ключевых принципов фашизма является корпоративизм - система, в которой различные социальные и экономические группы сотрудничают вместе во благо нации. Фашистская идеология пропагандирует силу, милитаризм и национальную единственность. Фашисты акцентируют внимание на социальной и национальной принадлежности, превозносят свою нацию как выдающуюся и превосходящую другие. Они стремятся создать единство в обществе, представляя его как группу, обладающую одними и теми же интересами и целями. Фашизм также является авторитарной и централизованной формой правления, где власть сосредоточена в руках одного лидера или партии. Важным аспектом фашистской идеологии является культ личности, где лидер считается жизненной силой нации и пользуется бесоговорочной поддержкой. Национал-социализм, неразрывно связанный с гитлеризмом и нацистской Германией, включает в себя комбинацию национализма, социализма, расовой теории и антисемитизма. Нацистская партия, возглавляемая Адольфом Гитлером, стремилась создать \\"арийскую расу\\" и устанавливала политику жесткой иерархии между \\"чистокровными\\" арьями и остальными. В целях достижения этой расовой идеологии нацистское правительство приняло ряд репрессивных мер в отношении негерманских народов и евреев, включая систематическое уничтожение миллионов людей во время Холокоста. Одним из основных принципов национал-социализма является государственный социализм. Нацисты руководствовались концепцией, согласно которой государство должно контролировать экономическую сферу и обеспечивать благосостояние для всех граждан. Как фашизм, так и национал-социализм были крайне универсальными концепциями, оказавшими значительное влияние на развитие Европы и других регионов мира. Оба движения характеризуются силой и национализмом, призывая к определенной форме государственного устройства и идеологической единства. Однако, в связи с их нацистскими корнями, национал-социализм также ассоциируется с нарушением прав человека и преступлениями против человечности."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Помоги","completion":"Конечно, я могу помочь вам создать безопасное хранилище с использованием мьютексов в языке Go (Golang). Начните с создания структуры для вашего хранилища и определения типа данных дженериками. Вот пример: \`\`\`go package main import ( \\"sync\\" ) type SafeStorage[T any] struct { storage map[string]T mutex sync.Mutex } func NewSafeStorage[T any]() *SafeStorage[T] { return &SafeStorage[T]{ storage: make(map[string]T), } } func (s *SafeStorage[T]) Set(key string, value T) { s.mutex.Lock() defer s.mutex.Unlock() s.storage[key] = value } func (s *SafeStorage[T]) Get(key string) (T, bool) { s.mutex.Lock() defer s.mutex.Unlock() value, ok := s.storage[key] return value, ok } func main() { storage := NewSafeStorage[int]() storage.Set(\\"key1\\", 42) if value, ok := storage.Get(\\"key1\\"); ok { fmt.Println(value) // Output: 42 } } \`\`\` В приведенном коде мы создаем структуру \`SafeStorage[T]\`, которая имеет поле \`storage\` типа \`map[string]T\`. Мы также добавляем поле \`mutex\` типа \`sync.Mutex\`, который будет использоваться для обеспечения безопасности доступа к хранилищу. Метод \`Set\` блокирует мьютекс перед изменением хранилища, а затем освобождает его после завершения. Метод \`Get\` также блокирует мьютекс перед чтением из хранилища и освобождает его после чтения. В функции \`main\` мы создаем новый экземпляр \`SafeStorage[int]\` с помощью функции \`NewSafeStorage\`. Затем мы устанавливаем значение \\"42\\" по ключу \\"key1\\" с помощью метода \`Set\`, а затем получаем это значение с помощью метода \`Get\`. Это лишь пример, и вы можете изменить структуру хранилища и его методы под различные потребности."},{"prompt":"Спасибо.

Затем мы добавляем элементы в срез с помощью метода \`Append\` и получаем элемент с индексом 1 с помощью метода \`Get\`. Вы можете изменить этот пример, чтобы адаптировать его под конкретные потребности, добавлять или изменять методы, а также менять тип данных в дженериках."},{"prompt":"Требуется функция на голанг которая будет вызываться в цикле пока не завершится контекст.","completion":"В языке Go (Golang) для реализации такой функции вы можете использовать горутину с помощью пакета \`context\`. Вот пример функции, которая будет вызываться в цикле до завершения контекста: \`\`\`go package main import ( \\"context\\" \\"fmt\\" \\"time\\" ) func main() { ctx := context.Background() // Создаем корневой контекст // Можно использовать context.WithTimeout или context.WithCancel для создания контекста с таймаутом или отменой // Например: // ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second) // defer cancel() go myFunction(ctx) // Запускаем функцию в отдельной горутине time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) // Даем время для выполнения функции fmt.Println(\\"Завершение программы\\") } func myFunction(ctx context.Context) { for { select { case <-ctx.Done(): fmt.Println(\\"Контекст завершился\\") return default: // Ваш код здесь, это место, где выполняется ваша функция в цикле fmt.Println(\\"Выполняется...\\") time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Демонстрационная пауза } } } \`\`\` В этом примере мы используем функцию \`context.Background()\` для создания корневого контекста. Затем мы запускаем функцию \`myFunction\` в отдельной горутине и даем ей максимум 10 секунд для выполнения. \`myFunction\` содержит бесконечный цикл, который проверяет состояние контекста через \`select\`. Если контекст завершился (например, из-за отмены или истечения таймаута), функция завершает свою работу и выходит из цикла. Обратите внимание, что это только базовый пример, и вы можете адаптировать его под свои конкретные потребности. Можете использовать функции \`context.WithTimeout\` или \`context.WithCancel\` для создания контекста с таймаутом или возможностью отмены."},{"prompt":"posgressql как работает оператор count","completion":"В PostgreSQL оператор \`COUNT\` используется для получения количества строк, удовлетворяющих определенному условию. Оператор \`COUNT\` имеет следующий синтаксис: \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition; \`\`\` Где: - \`column_name\` - имя столбца, для которого нужно посчитать количество значений. Если вы хотите посчитать все строки в таблице, вы можете использовать \`*\` вместо имени столбца. - \`table_name\` - имя таблицы, из которой нужно получить данные. - \`condition\` - условие, определяющее строки, которые нужно учитывать в подсчете (необязательно, можно опустить). Пример использования: \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees; \`\`\` Этот запрос вернет общее количество строк в таблице \`employees\`. \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE age > 30; \`\`\` Этот запрос вернет количество строк в таблице \`employees\`, где значение столбца \`age\` больше 30. \`COUNT\` может также использоваться в сочетании с другими операторами и функциями, например, с оператором \`GROUP BY\`, чтобы подсчитать количество строк для каждой группы. Пример: \`\`\`sql SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department; \`\`\` В этом запросе мы получаем количество сотрудников в каждом отделе, группируя данные по столбцу \`department\`. Оператор \`COUNT\` может быть полезным инструментом для подсчета строк и получения агрегированных данных из таблицы в PostgreSQL."},{"prompt":"golang объединить два строковых среза","completion":"В языке Go (Golang) вы можете объединить два строковых среза, используя функцию \`append\`. Вот пример: \`\`\`go package main import \\"fmt\\" func main() { slice1 := []string{\\"Hello\\", \\"world\\"} slice2 := []string{\\"How\\", \\"are\\", \\"you\\"} slice3 := append(slice1, slice2...) fmt.Println(slice3) // [Hello world How are you] } \`\`\` В этом примере у нас есть два строковых среза \`slice1\` и \`slice2\`. Мы используем функцию \`append\` для объединения \`slice1\` и \`slice2\`. Обратите внимание, что \`slice2...\` используется для распаковки элементов \`slice2\` в \`append\`, чтобы добавить каждый элемент отдельно. Результатом выполнения кода будет срез \`slice3\`, содержащий объединенные элементы срезов \`slice1\` и \`slice2\`. Можете также использовать оператор \`...\` для распаковки элементов среза при передаче его аргументом в функцию или другую переменную. Например: \`\`\`go package main import \\"fmt\\" func main() { slice1 := []string{\\"Hello\\", \\"world\\"} slice2 := []string{\\"How\\", \\"are\\", \\"you\\"} slice3 := append(slice1, slice2...) var slice4 []string slice4 = append(slice4, slice1...) slice4 = append(slice4, slice2...) fmt.Println(slice3) // [Hello world How are you] fmt.Println(slice4) // [Hello world How are you] } \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что используется \`slice2...\`, чтобы распаковать элементы \`slice2\`, чтобы добавить их к \`slice1\` и \`slice4\`. Таким образом, вам предоставлены два способа объединения строковых срезов в языке Go (Golang). Выберите тот, который наиболее удобен для вашего конкретного случая использования."},{"prompt":"как сделать копию среза?","completion":"В языке Go (Golang) вы можете создать копию среза, используя функцию \`copy\`. Функция \`copy\` копирует элементы одного среза в другой срез. Вот пример: \`\`\`go package main import \\"fmt\\" func main() { slice1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // Создаем новый срез с той же емкостью, что и slice1 slice2 := make([]int, len(slice1)) copy(slice2, slice1) fmt.Println(slice2) // [1 2 3 4 5] // Меняем значения в slice1 slice1[0] = 10 fmt.Println(slice1) // [10 2 3 4 5] fmt.Println(slice2) // [1 2 3 4 5] } \`\`\` В этом примере у нас есть срез \`slice1\`, который мы хотим скопировать. Мы создаем новый срез \`slice2\` с помощью функции \`make\`, указывая длину \`len(slice1)\` и передаем его в функцию \`copy\` вместе с оригинальным срезом \`slice1\`. Функция \`copy\` копирует элементы \`slice1\` в \`slice2\`. Заметьте, что изменения в \`slice1\` не влияют на \`slice2\`, так как это две независимые копии. Обратите внимание, что функция \`copy\` работает только на элементах, которые были инициализированы. Если вам нужно создать полную копию среза (включая емкость), вы можете использовать срез-срез (slicing) для этого. Вот пример: \`\`\`go package main import \\"fmt\\" func main() { slice1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} slice2 := slice1[:] fmt.Println(slice2) // [1 2 3 4 5] // Меняем значения в slice1 slice1[0] = 10 fmt.Println(slice1) // [10 2 3 4 5] fmt.Println(slice2) // [10 2 3 4 5] } \`\`\` В этом случае мы используем срез-срез \`slice1[:]\`, чтобы создать полную копию среза \`slice1\` со всей его емкостью. Изменения в \`slice1\` также отражаются в \`slice2\`, потому что они ссылаются на одно и то же хранилище данных. Выберите подход, который наилучшим образом соответствует вашим потребностям в конкретном случае."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For this example, let’s assume it’s a generic I2C oxygen sensor. # Step 2: Create the Library Structure An Arduino library typically consists of at least two files: a header file (\`.h\`) and an implementation file (\`.cpp\`). For our example, let’s name the library \`OxygenSensor\`. Create the files: - \`OxygenSensor.h\` - \`OxygenSensor.cpp\` # Step 3: Write the Header File \`\`\`cpp // OxygenSensor.h #ifndef OxygenSensor_h #define OxygenSensor_h #include \\"Arduino.h\\" #include <Wire.h> class OxygenSensor { public: OxygenSensor(uint8_t address); void begin(); float readOxygenLevel(); private: uint8_t _address; }; #endif \`\`\` # Step 4: Implement the Library \`\`\`cpp // OxygenSensor.cpp #include \\"OxygenSensor.h\\" OxygenSensor::OxygenSensor(uint8_t address) { _address = address; } void OxygenSensor::begin() { Wire.begin(); } float OxygenSensor::readOxygenLevel() { // Here you'd write code to communicate with your oxygen sensor. // This is a placeholder to illustrate the structure. Wire.beginTransmission(_address); // Ideally, you'd request relevant data from the sensor // and convert the bytes obtained to a meaningful oxygen level // value based on the sensor's datasheet. Wire.endTransmission(); // Temporary example value for the purpose of this guide float oxygenLevel = 20.9; // As if the oxygen level is 20.9% return oxygenLevel; } \`\`\` # Step 5: Write an Example Sketch In the library folder, create a new folder called \`examples\` and then create a new \`.ino\` file inside it. For instance \`ExampleUsage.ino\`: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <OxygenSensor.h> // Replace with your sensor's I2C address const uint8_t oxygenSensorAddress = 0xXX; OxygenSensor oxygenSensor(oxygenSensorAddress); void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); oxygenSensor.begin(); } void loop() { float oxygenLevel = oxygenSensor.readOxygenLevel(); Serial.print(\\"Oxygen Level: \\"); Serial.print(oxygenLevel); Serial.println(\\"%\\"); delay(1000); } \`\`\` # Step 6: Test Your Library Now it's time to test the library with a real sensor: 1. Connect your oxygen sensor to the Arduino as per the datasheet instructions. 2. Compile and upload \`ExampleUsage.ino\` to your Arduino. 3. Open the Serial Monitor to see the oxygen level readings. # Step 7: Document the Library Provide a README file and inline comments explaining how to install and use the library, how to connect the sensor, the functions available, and any other important information. # Step 8: Distribute the Library Once tested and documented, your library can be shared. Consider publishing it on GitHub, or submitting it to the Arduino Library Registry for others to easily find and use. This is a very simple and hypothetical implementation. The actual implementation would depend on how the oxygen sensor communicates and its protocol.

Utilizing the same icon for both Apple App Store and Google Play Store neglects several important aspects, both from a branding and from a technical compliance standpoint. Firstly, Apple and Google have distinct brand guidelines and icon specifications. For example, Apple typically requires a certain style of icon with no transparencies or alpha channels, set within specific dimensions and corner radii, while Google may have different specifications for its material design interface. Ignoring these guidelines can result in your app being rejected from the respective stores or not appearing as intended, which can damage user perception and trust in your product. Secondly, user expectations differ across platforms. iOS users are accustomed to the aesthetic and functional conventions of the Apple ecosystem, while Android users are familiar with Google's material design and interface elements. A one-size-fits-all approach neglects these differences and could result in an incongruent user experience, which is counterproductive to maintaining a professional brand image. Thirdly, market-specific features and promotions are important. Each platform offers different opportunities for app promotion and user engagement. By customizing your icon and branding for a specific marketplace, you can more effectively leverage these features to optimize visibility and appeal to your target audience. Furthermore, customization allows for A/B testing and optimization. By having different icons for each store, you can test which icon performs better in terms of click-through rates and conversions within each platform, allowing for data-driven marketing strategies. In conclusion, while it might be tempting to streamline your app submission process by using the same icon for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, it's vital from a marketing perspective to tailor your app's presentation to meet the specific demands and expectations of each platform. Doing so not only ensures adherence to platform guidelines but also enables you to optimize your brand's resonance with your desired audience, thus driving better engagement and performance for your app."},{"prompt":"Напиши кратко об научных исследованиях проходящих в Петербурге","completion":"Санкт-Петербург – один из крупнейших научных и образовательных центров России, где проводится множество исследований в различных областях науки, включая физику, медицину, биотехнологии, информационные технологии, социальные и гуманитарные науки и многие другие.

If you want to remove the graphical user interface (GUI) and return to the initial booting screen after everything loads, you can switch to a text-based interface called a TTY (TeleTYpewriter). This will allow you to read the boot process and system messages without the GUI. To switch to a TTY, you can follow these steps: Press the Ctrl + Alt + F2 keys simultaneously. This will take you to the second TTY, and you’ll have a login prompt. Press Enter to get a login prompt and enter your username and password to log in. Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations. You can switch between various TTYs using the Ctrl + Alt + F1 to F6 keys. The default TTY used by the GUI is usually Ctrl + Alt + F7. By switching to a TTY, you can view the boot process and system messages without the graphical interface. This can be useful for identifying any issues or errors that occur during the boot process. \\"Once logged in, you’ll have access to a text-based interface where you can read system messages and perform command-line operations.\\". need initial boot screen where initial linux os booting process are, to read. any ideas? Apologies for the confusion. If you want to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process, you can follow these steps: Reboot your system if it’s currently running. During the boot process, you should see the GRUB bootloader menu. If you don’t see it by default, you can press the Shift or Esc key repeatedly while the system is starting up to display the GRUB menu. In the GRUB menu, there should be an entry for your Linux operating system (e.g., “Ubuntu,” “Fedora,” etc.). Use the arrow keys to select that entry. Once the desired operating system entry is selected, press the e key to edit the boot parameters for that entry. This will take you to a screen where you can see the boot parameters. Look for a line that starts with “linux” or “linuxefi”. Move the cursor to the end of that line and add the word text at the end, without changing any existing parameters. This tells the system to boot into a text-only mode. Once you’ve added text, press Ctrl + X or F10 to boot the system with the modified parameters. By following these steps, you will boot into a text-only mode without starting the GUI, allowing you to view the initial boot screen and read the Linux OS booting process directly. Please note that modifying boot parameters can affect system behavior, so proceed with caution. If you’re unsure or encounter any issues, it’s recommended to seek assistance from a knowledgeable user or consult the documentation specific to your Linux distribution. why there's no any specific keys to hold the loading without gui initialization in linux os? as for windows loading process where you can choose which mode to load by pressing F8 at boot time? In Linux operating systems, the boot process is designed to be relatively fast and automatic. Unlike Windows, there is no specific key or built-in mechanism during the boot process to hold the loading and choose different modes. However, various options can be configured within the boot loader (such as GRUB) to modify the boot behavior or choose different modes. These options are typically modified in the boot configuration files or by editing the boot parameters during the boot process. Common options that can be used during the Linux boot process include: Single User Mode / Recovery Mode: This mode allows you to boot into a minimal environment with root privileges, often used for troubleshooting and system maintenance tasks. It can be selected from the GRUB menu. Different Kernel Versions: If you have multiple kernel versions installed, you can choose a specific kernel version from the GRUB menu during the boot process. Boot Parameters: As mentioned earlier, you can modify boot parameters in the GRUB menu to specify different modes or configurations. While Linux does not have a dedicated key, like F8 in Windows, the flexibility of the boot loader and customizable boot parameters provide similar functionality to choose different modes or configurations during startup. It’s important to note that the specific method to modify boot behavior may vary depending on your Linux distribution. It is recommended to refer to the documentation or community resources specific to your distribution for more detailed information on boot options and customization. but it's pretty simple and intuitive by using some F8 key at boot time, for users absolutely unfamilar which params where to add specifically to achieve desired result. You’re right, having a dedicated key like F8 in Windows for accessing boot options can be more straightforward and user-friendly, especially for users who are less familiar with the specific boot parameters to achieve their desired results. Linux distributions generally provide a more modular and customizable approach to booting, allowing users to have greater control over the boot process. However, this flexibility also means that the options may require some technical knowledge to utilize effectively. While Linux doesn’t have a universally standardized key like F8, some Linux distributions offer alternative methods to access boot options that are relatively user-friendly. Here are a few examples: Ubuntu: Holding down the Shift key during the boot process should bring up the GRUB menu, where you can access various boot options. Fedora: Pressing the Esc key can bring up the GRUB menu during the boot process. Arch Linux: Pressing the Tab key allows you to edit boot parameters before booting. It’s worth noting that these methods may vary depending on the specific Linux distribution and the boot loader being used. The best approach is to consult the documentation or community resources for your particular Linux distribution to obtain accurate and up-to-date information on accessing boot options. Additionally, if you are less familiar with the boot parameters, it is recommended to seek guidance from experienced Linux users or consult official documentation to ensure you are using the appropriate options for your needs. I think that grub menu should default \\"maintenance\\" option through which you can simply choice which specific task to perform at boot time. Understood. Having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu would indeed provide a simplified and intuitive way to choose specific tasks or modes at boot time, especially for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes. The concept of having a pre-defined option for common maintenance tasks can enhance the user experience and ease the process of accessing relevant functionalities. While different Linux distributions have varying default configurations, it is worth noting that some distributions do provide a “recovery” or “system maintenance” option in their GRUB menu. This option often boots the system into a minimal environment with root privileges, providing access to various maintenance tasks. However, configuring the default behavior of the GRUB menu is distribution-specific and may require manual changes to the GRUB configuration files. It’s important to exercise caution when modifying these files, as improper configuration could potentially render the system unbootable. If having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu aligns with your preferences, you could consider exploring your distribution’s documentation or community resources to learn how to customize the GRUB configuration to suit your needs. Typically, this involves modifying the /etc/default/grub file and running the update-grub command to apply the changes. Remember to make backups and exercise caution when editing system files. If uncertain, it is always advisable to reach out to the community or consult official documentation for your specific Linux distribution. \\"distribution-specific\\". maybe some maybe, but they all in one linux concept, so why not to use it? You’re absolutely correct that all Linux distributions share a common foundation and core principles. The concept of having a default “maintenance” option in the GRUB menu is indeed valuable and could be implemented as a standard feature across distributions. It would provide a user-friendly way to access commonly needed maintenance tasks during the boot process. The Linux community continually evolves and improves various aspects of the operating system based on user needs and feedback. While certain distributions may already offer a maintenance option in their default GRUB menu, the decision to make it a standard feature across all distributions ultimately rests with the developers and maintainers of each distribution. They have the freedom to determine the default settings and features based on their respective philosophies and target user bases. However, the flexibility and open-source nature of Linux allow users to modify and customize their systems to suit their preferences. Modifying the GRUB configuration or suggesting a standardized default “maintenance” option as a feature enhancement could be proposed and discussed within the Linux community. Engaging with the relevant distribution communities, participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes that benefit a wider audience. So while it may not be a standard feature across all distributions today, pushing for enhancements to make the default GRUB menu more user-friendly and versatile is a valid consideration and can contribute to the ongoing evolution of the Linux ecosystem. \\"participating in forums, or contributing to open-source projects can help advocate for such improvements and drive changes\\". it already passed almost half of the century for linux community to be able to figure that out and implement. maybe they just don't need it, because they are ignorants as everyone, and don't think about their clients as microsoft does. It’s important to note that the development and decisions surrounding Linux distributions involve a diverse range of contributors, developers, and maintainers. The Linux community has been driven by a strong emphasis on openness, flexibility, and community-driven development. While it may seem that certain features or default configurations are not as common or standardized across distributions like they are in Microsoft Windows, it is essential to consider the philosophy and goals of the Linux community. Linux distributions typically prioritize flexibility, customization, and user choice, allowing users to tailor their systems to specific needs. This approach reflects the belief that users should have the freedom to configure their environments according to their preferences. Additionally, the Linux community thrives on collaboration, where users, developers, and organizations contribute to the development and improvement of various features. Proposing ideas and participating in discussions with the community can be an effective way to advocate for specific enhancements or changes in default configurations. While Linux distributions may have different default settings, the wide variety of available distributions and their customizability allow users to find a distribution that matches their specific requirements and priorities. Ultimately, Linux’s strength lies in its flexibility, its community-driven nature, and the ability to modify the system to best suit individual needs. nothing by the fact, gpt.

To conduct a thorough examination of the file system to search for unauthorized files, directories, or executables using tools like find and grep, you can follow these steps: Open a terminal on your Linux system. Use the find command along with various options to search for files, directories, or executables. For example, to find files with specific extensions like .sh (shell scripts) or .bin (binary executables), you can use the following commands: find / -type f -name “.sh\\" find / -type f -name \\".bin” The above commands will search from the root directory (/) recursively for files with the specified extensions. To search for files owned by a specific user, you can use the -user option. For example, to look for files owned by the user “john,” you can run: find / -user john This command will search from the root directory for files owned by the user “john.” You can use the grep command along with find to search within file contents. For example, to search for specific keywords or patterns within files, you can use the following command: find / -type f -exec grep -l “keyword or pattern” {} + Replace “keyword or pattern” with the specific word or pattern you want to search for. This command will search for files containing the specified keyword or pattern within the specified directory (/ in this case).

Indicate its main authors and representatives of neopositivist philosophy of science.","completion":"The cumulative theory of scientific dynamics, also known as cumulative growth theory, is a concept in the philosophy of science that suggests scientific knowledge progresses and accumulates over time through a process of incremental advancement. It posits that every scientific theory or paradigm includes and builds upon previous theories, leading to a cumulative growth of knowledge. The main authors associated with the cumulative theory of scientific dynamics include Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and Imre Lakatos. While these authors may not subscribe fully to the neopositivist philosophy of science, their contributions and ideas have influenced and shaped this field. Karl Popper is known for his falsification theory, which emphasizes testing and attempting to refute scientific theories through empirical observations. Popper argued that scientific knowledge progresses through the iterative process of conjectures and refutations, with one falsified theory being replaced by a more refined and reliable one. Thomas Kuhn introduced the concept of scientific revolutions in his influential book \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\\" Kuhn argued that scientific knowledge does not simply accumulate steadily but progresses through paradigm shifts. These shifts occur when existing theories and assumptions face anomalies that cannot be easily resolved, leading to a crisis and eventually giving way to a new paradigm. Imre Lakatos, influenced by Popper and Kuhn, developed the research program approach. Lakatos proposed that scientific progress depends on the competition between research programs rather than individual theories. According to Lakatos, research programs consist of a hard core of unchangeable principles surrounded by a protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses. Scientific progress occurs when a research program successfully generates novel predictions and explanations. While the neopositivist philosophy of science was influential during the early to mid-20th century, the cumulative theory of scientific dynamics represented a departure from the strict logical positivist views. Instead of focusing solely on the verification or falsification of individual statements, this theory recognizes the complex and cumulative nature of scientific knowledge, highlighting the importance of the interplay between theories, paradigms, and research programs."},{"prompt":"关于课题“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”的可能遇到的困难有哪些","completion":"研究“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”可能会面临以下一些困难： 1. 非线性性质：Burgers方程是一个非线性偏微分方程，它的非线性性质会给研究带来困难。非线性方程通常没有明确的解析解，需要使用数值方法进行求解。如何处理方程中的非线性项，并证明其解的存在性和唯一性，是一个具有挑战性的问题。 2. 随机性质：研究的是随机Burgers方程，其中包含一个随机项。随机性质的引入增加了方程的复杂性。分析随机项的影响、如何处理随机项的不确定性，以及如何证明随机Burgers方程的解的存在性和唯一性，是研究中的难点。 3. 泛函性质：Burgers方程是一个涉及到函数本身及其导数的方程，它涉及到一些函数空间的泛函性质的研究。对函数空间的分析和处理需要运用一些高级的数学理论和工具，如泛函分析、Sobolev空间等，对研究者的数学功底要求较高。 4. 边界条件：Burgers方程需要指定合适的边界条件，以确定方程的解。选择恰当的边界条件并证明边界条件的适宜性也是一个挑战。 5. 数值解的准确性：由于难以求得方程的解析解，需要使用数值方法来近似求解方程。数值方法的准确性和稳定性对于证明解的存在性和唯一性至关重要。选择合适的数值方法，并对数值解进行误差估计和收敛性分析，是研究中需要解决的问题。 6. 研究框架和方法：确定研究框架和采用合适的方法也是一个挑战，因为对于“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”这个课题，可能涉及到不同的数学工具和技术，需要整合和运用这些工具来解决问题。 需要注意的是，以上困难仅为一般性的讨论，具体的困难可能因研究者的具体目标、方法和背景知识的不同而有所变化。研究者在面对这些困难时，需要运用适当的数学工具和方法，以及具备坚定的毅力和创造性思维来攻克这些困难。"},{"prompt":"关于课题“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”的可能遇到的困难有哪些","completion":"研究“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”可能会面临以下一些困难： 1. 非线性性质：Burgers方程是一个非线性偏微分方程，它的非线性性质会给研究带来困难。非线性方程通常没有明确的解析解，需要使用数值方法进行求解。如何处理方程中的非线性项，并证明其解的存在性和唯一性，是一个具有挑战性的问题。 2. 随机性质：研究的是随机Burgers方程，其中包含一个随机项。随机性质的引入增加了方程的复杂性。研究如何处理随机项的不确定性、如何证明随机Burgers方程的解的存在性和唯一性，以及如何分析随机项对解的影响，是研究中的难点。 3. 数学分析方法：研究随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性需要运用一些高级的数学分析方法和技巧，如泛函分析、测度论等。这些方法对于研究者的数学功底要求较高，可能需要具备一定的数学背景和技术。 4. 遍历测度理论：研究方程的不变测度存在唯一性需要使用到遍历测度理论。遍历测度理论是一个相对复杂的数学理论，需要仔细理解和应用，而且可能需要针对具体的研究对象进行适应性的扩展和推广。 5. 边界条件：Burgers方程需要指定合适的边界条件，以确定方程的解。选择适当的边界条件，确保边界条件与方程的要求相符，并证明边界条件的适宜性也是一个挑战。 6. 数值解的准确性：由于难以求得方程的解析解，需要使用数值方法来近似求解方程。数值方法的准确性和稳定性对于证明解的存在性和唯一性至关重要。选择合适的数值方法，并对数值解进行误差估计和收敛性分析，是研究中需要解决的问题。 7. 先验知识的缺乏：在某些情况下，对于特定的随机Burgers方程，可能缺乏先验的数学知识和已有的研究成果。这可能导致研究难度加大，需要更多的创造性和独立思考。 需要注意的是，以上困难仅为一般性的讨论，具体的困难和挑战可能因研究者的具体目标、方法和背景知识的不同而有所变化。解决这些困难需要研究者具备坚定的毅力、扎实的数学基础和创造性思维，同时可能需要找到适当的学术导师或专家提供指导和支持。"},{"prompt":"关于课题“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”的现有的研究基础有哪些","completion":"说到课题“随机Burgers方程的不变测度存在唯一性”的现有研究基础，主要包括以下几个方面的研究成果和理论基础： 1.

Conversely, a negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. Correlation is usually expressed as a value between -1 and 1, with 0 indicating no correlation.

Interpret the correlation coefficient by considering its value, ranging from -1 to 1. Values close to -1 or 1 indicate a strong correlation, while values close to 0 suggest a weak or no correlation. 5. Assess the statistical significance of the correlation coefficient through hypothesis testing. This will help determine if the observed correlation is likely to have occurred by chance or if it represents a true relationship. 6. Analyze the data further by using scatter plots or other visualizations to understand the nature of the relationship between the variables. 7.

Что в кастрюле не подходит к тому, что на сковороде? Что нужно знать, чтобы ответить на вопрос этой задачи? 1) сковорода была большая; 2) на сковороде были сазан и щука; 3) в кастрюле было много воды.","completion":"Чтобы ответить на этот вопрос, важно понять, как обычно готовятся разные виды продуктов и какие методы приготовления для них традиционно используются. Изначальная информация говорит о том, что на сковороде жарили, а в кастрюле варили продукты. Жарка и варка — это два разных метода приготовления пищи, требующие разных условий и оборудования. Рассмотрим предложенные утверждения: 1) Сковорода была большая. Это утверждение не влияет непосредственно на суть вопроса, поскольку размер сковороды не определяет совместимость продуктов, которые в ней готовятся. 2) На сковороде были сазан и щука. Это утверждение дает понимание того, что в ситуации жарки на сковороде использовались рыбы (сазан и щука), а значит, метод приготовления соответствует этим продуктам. 3) В кастрюле было много воды. Это утверждение подсказывает, что в кастрюле варили продукты, и вода является основой для варки. Традиционно рыбу (карася) чаще варят, чем жарят, и обильное количество воды подходит для этого метода приготовления. В то же время курицу также можно варить. Итак, исходя из общих принципов приготовления пищи, кажется, что все продукты подходят к соответствующим методам приготовления (в кастрюле варят, на сковороде жарят). Однако, если рассматривать вопрос более детально: Если учесть, что обычно рыбу и мясо не готовят вместе (особенно в одной кастрюле), поскольку это разные виды продуктов с разным временем приготовления и вкусом, то можно сказать, что курица (мясо) \\"не подходит\\" к карасю (рыбе). Особенно в контексте варки в одной кастрюле, потому что мясо обычно требует большего времени на приготовление, и смешивание вкусов мяса и рыбы может быть нежелательным. В отношении того, что на сковороде жарили сазана и щуку – эти два вида рыбы подходят друг к другу для жарки, поскольку это оба представители рыб, и нет нежелательного смешивания вкусов, как в случае с рыбой и курицей в одной кастрюле. Таким образом, чтобы ответить на вопрос этой задачи, необходимо принять во внимание особенности приготовления различных видов продуктов и традиционные кулинарные предпочтения."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

человека который решил стать лучше он приобретает новые навыки знакомиться с новыми людьми и планируют новые проекты и по-новому организует свою жизнь теперь он избавился от вредных привычек и занялся спортом он просыпается раньше всех и усердно трудиться совершенствуя свое мастерство шаг за шагом он приближается к успеху однако как это бывает с лучшими из нас рано или поздно что-то идет не так продуктивность проседает вредные привычки возвращаются а перспективные проекты забрасываются даже самые стойкие из нас ломаются своей дисциплине и впадают в периоды апатии назовем это падением ты споткнулся упал и для того чтобы продолжить движение сначала тебе необходимо встать именно скорость подъема делает человека успешным разница между тем кто многого достигает и всеми остальными в том как быстро они встают с колен кто-то годами купается в собственных сожалениях забирая себя в тюрьме слабости а кто-то уже через минуту осознав собственные ошибки устремляется к новым горизонтам и наука это подтверждает исследование 2007 года показало что именно упорство то есть умение эффект цели несмотря на неудачи есть ключевой фактор в достижении целей иными словами неважно упал ты или нет важно как быстро ты поднялся а поэтому в этом видео я расскажу как с точки зрения науки стать после падения раньше я очень любил себя критиковать если я совершал ошибку подводил друга говорил глупость перед толпой незнакомых людей или нарушал данное себе обещание не есть вредную пищу в моей голове возникал рой осуждающих голосов я думала свои неудачи пережевывал каждую секунду своего позора заворожено воспроизводил эти события и знаете что я считал что это полезно и правда ведь самокритика необходимо если ты не знаешь почему совершил ошибку следующий раз ты вновь ее совершишь поэтому чисто стратегически очень важно думать о провале чем больше ты о нем думаешь тем выше шанс того что ты преуспеешь следующий раз логично я думал что да пока не наткнулся на несколько весьма занимательных исследований в 2006 была опубликована работа которая показала что самокритика снижает нашу внутреннюю мотивацию при достижении целей оказывается чем больше мы себя критикуем и думаем о своих неудачах тем меньше хотим делать то что сами же запланировали интересно через год ученые провели ещё несколько экспериментов и обнаружили что критика и себя мы не только убиваем мотивацию но еще и гораздо медленнее достигаем своих целей данные на студентах обнаруживать те же тенденции в 2007 стало известно что ученики которые себя критиковали чаще прокрастинировать и зацикливаясь на проблемах хуже с ними справлялись выходит размышление о своих неудачах не только не ускоряют прогресс как я этого ожидал а делают прямо обратно и в 2009 похоже опыт и провели на атлетах и музыкантах результаты были теми же чем больше критики в свой адрес мы направляем тем медленнее наш прогресс но и это не все в придачу к низкой мотивации и продуктивности следует добавить депрессию и не только депрессию ну и тревожность и худшие оценки на учебе и гораздо меньше вероятность приятных событий в жизни в общем наблюдения современных ученых говорят нам что заниматься самокритикой вредно что же значит бросаем самокритику все будет замечательно сожалению все не так просто во-первых мы очень очень любим неадекватно себя критиковать нас заставляет эволюция исторически так сложилось что человек должен был замечать опасность те из нас кто плохо оценивал риски в том числе в своем поведении просто не продолжали свой рот не понял во время что твоя стратегия не работает умер твоя генетика от съелась как неэффективно и поэтому являясь потомками весьма негативно ориентированных предков мы концентрируем внимание на destructive даже если положительных моментов окружающем мире гораздо больше негатив всегда актуален он позволяет нам избегать ошибок в будущем и в конечном счете выживать возьмем например данные из поведенческой экономики исследования показывают что если человек выиграет 100 долларов а затем проиграет 80 то в сумме он ощутит это как проигрыш и будет очень расстроен хотя по факту он из воздуха получил 20 долларов то же самое можно сказать о выборах из научных работ мы знаем что избиратели сильнее всего мотивируется опасностью и гораздо меньше интересует положительные обещание кандидата и хорошие стороны его характера гораздо более привлекателен негатив сколько угроз ты видишь какие у тебя слабости и чем больше кандидат пугает а также портят репутацию другого кандидата тем выше вероятность что его изберут и это касается всего например мы дольше смотрим на фотографии с неприятными или опасными стимулами в сравнении с теми на которых изображено что-то положительное мы охотнее покупаем газеты со страшными заголовками и смотрим плохие новости мы легче вспоминаем негативные события в сравнении с позитивными нас больше интересует критика они восхваления и нам кажется что мы за свою жизнь и спина ли гораздо меньше положительных чувств чем она была на самом деле в общем справедливо будет сказать что мы существа очень негативные это наше свойство называется предвзятостью к негативу именно из-за него мы так концентрируемся на своих неудачах возвращаясь к примеру молодого человека который упал мы заметим что он зацикливается на своем провале неудача ошибка негатив для его мозга нет ничего важнее этого поражения несмотря на то что в общей сумме он скорее победитель ведь он какое-то время был очень продуктивен и получал новый опыт он отказывается видеть прогресс и видит только ошибку несмотря на то что выигрыш составил 20 долларов он оплакивает потерянные 80 он концентрируется на неудачи и скорее всего именно она на долгое время станет фокусом его внимания подрывая продуктивность и силу воли он думает ах дисциплины не для меня я ни на что не гожусь а в итоге может вообще забросить все мысли о саморазвитии и опустить руки и как вы понимаете это не самая оптимальная стратегия чтобы встать после падения ему следовало бы как можно быстрее разобраться со своим деструктивном в голове забыть его переработать или трансформировать в продуктивную энергию к счастью мы знаем как это сделать с точки зрения науки есть три шага во первых когда вы только совершили ошибку не думайте и позвольте себе прожить негативные эмоции современном мире есть какое-то негласный запрет на неприятные чувства люди либо пытается от них отвлечься замаскированных алкоголем тусовками и компьютерными играми либо всеми силами стараются их подавить погружаясь в работу размышления и самокопания аналогов суммы из дивного нового мира существует огромное количество однако все они хоть и заставляет нас чувствовать себя лучше и замедляют прогресс наши предки же имели традицию даже не допускать к работе тех кто пережил боль смерти близкого потерял любовь или проходит через кризис внутренней трансформации они позволяли каждому прожить свои негативные эмоции часто такие безработные периоды длились несколько месяцев а в некоторых культурах даже лет участникам сообщества не разрешалось заталкивать свою боль в бездну бессознательного напротив скорбь егория были важными ритуалами и не зря в 2017 году был опубликован и исследования из которого мы знаем что лучшее что мы можем сделать чтобы вновь встать на ноги и с прежним энтузиазмом двигаться к поставленной цели это в первую очередь прожить негативные ощущения вместо того чтобы думать негативные мысли важно позволить себе ощутить грусть злость или разочарование вместо того чтобы думать о неудаче думайте о том что вы испытываете скажите себя я расстроен или я испытываю гнев или я ощущаю отчаяние побейте грушу покричите и поплачьте если надо дело в том что эмоции это тоже эволюционный механизм они позволяют нам адаптироваться к психологическому стрессу а также перестраивают и адаптирует наш организм к новым условиям внешней реальности и на против подавления эмоций чаще всего лишь усиливает их эффект когда мы испытываем эмоции наш мозг как бы учиться и это обучение гораздо более эффективно чем самокопания и самоанализ возьмем например слезы оказывается что когда мы плачем мы не только себя успокаиваем снижая сердцебиение кровяное давление мышечное напряжение и мыслительные возбуждения ну и лучшая свое настроение вырабатывая окситоцин опиоиды и эндорфины то же самое касается многих других эмоций позвольте себе ощутить неприятные чувства сравнении с интеллектуальными размышлениями вы сильнее и быстрее вновь захотите действовать вы отпустите неприятные воспоминания и будете готовы получать новый опыт во вторых сопровождаться все это должно состраданием к себе обращаю ваше внимание не сама сожалением не потаканием своей немощи не рекурсивным погружением собственную слабость наша задача всего лишь отнестись к себя как своему другу и к сожалению это чрезвычайно трудно дело в том что очень часто в детстве когда мы совершали ошибку родители встречали ее гневом и осуждением однако рано или поздно мы вырастаем родители перестают использовать кнут чтобы привить нам правильное поведение внешнее давление пропадают и угрожающая внешняя сила заставляющая на следовать правилам перемещается во внутренний мир мы уже не боимся родителей но привыкли к ним и все еще нуждаемся в наказание так что сами метафорически занимаемых место и принимаемся себя осуждать совершив ошибку мы повторяем сценарии из детства внутри своей головы и вырваться из этого сценария и поговорит собой как со своим другом очень непросто мы говорим себе что это непродуктивно что это признак слабого человека что это нытье и так далее однако если у вас это получится если вы сможете не осуждать но сострадательно взглянуть на тяжей собственного испытания вас ожидает быстрое восстановление согласно исследованиям сострадая себя мы становимся счастливее смелее меньше боимся неудач и легче их переносим мы начинаем себя ценить чаще обращаемся к врачу если на что-то беспокоит лучше питаемся реже выпиваем бросаем курить охотнее тренируемся учимся новому и работаем над собой вместо абстрактного перфекционизма мы выстраиваем собственные осмысленные стандарты исследуемым не потому что так нужно повинуясь тени родителей а потому что сами этого хотим в третьих после того как вы эмоционально прожили свою неудачу есть смысл подойти к ней рационально возьмите лист бумаги и ручку и распишите три пункта во первых все плюсы вашего провала чему вы научились как это поможет вам в будущем чего вы избежали возможно вы бы потеряли намного больше в будущем если не это неудача как вы используете этот урок в своей деятельности есть ли какая-то вероятность что в будущем вы будете рады что это неудача случилось не оплакиваете ли вы потерянный 80 долларов когда у вас в руках свеженькие 20 и так далее во вторых напишите в чем конкретно заключается минусы провала будьте максимально четкий в своих формулировках и вы увидите что возможным минусов не так много что все они временны и что вообще-то эти минусы когда-то могут стать и плюсами и наконец в третьих подумайте как избежать подобных ошибок в будущем обратите внимание мы не заканчиваем а начинаем этим вопросом вместо самокопания мы на холодную голову спокойно изучаем свой провал под микроскопом словно это учебник который нужно прочитать и сделать выводы мы себя не критикуем будущее на эмоциях это не ваш провал эта ошибка кого то еще а вы просто сторонний наблюдатель эмоционально не вовлечены в процесс и так ошибки и недостатки это вовсе не повод для стыда но сухая данность с ней можно работать а можно и не работать наказывает же себя в любом случае нет никакого смысла вместо этого нам следует повинуясь природе и учитывая опыт предков прожить негативные эмоции затем поговорить с собой как со своим другом и наконец аналитически сделать выводы из своей ошибки

Mathe services Health and Safety At R.D.M Architects, we place the utmost importance on health and safety in every facet of our work. We prioritize the well-being of both the workforce involved in the construction process and the eventual occupants of our designed spaces. Our firm employs rigorous safety protocols that adhere to and often exceed statutory regulations and industry standards. We begin by ensuring that our designs conceptually integrate safety measures. This includes specifying non-toxic, fire-resistant materials, implementing adequate means of egress, and designing for natural surveillance and security. Our meticulous planning phase includes comprehensive risk assessments where potential hazards are identified and mitigated. Throughout the construction stage, we maintain a proactive stance on health and safety. We work closely with contractors to ensure that the construction sites are managed with diligence and attention to safe practices. Regular on-site reviews and audits are conducted to ensure continuous alignment with our stringent safety policies, and we swiftly address any issues that arise to prevent accidents and injuries. Approach to Sustainability Sustainability is not just a service — it’s the foundation upon which R.D.M Architects is built. We define sustainability as creating environments that are inherently resilient, resource-efficient, and harmonious with the natural world. Our approach integrates sustainable best practices throughout the project lifecycle, from concept to completion. Our methodology employs various sustainable strategies, including passive solar design, natural ventilation, energy and water efficient systems, and the use of renewable energy sources. Material selection follows strict eco-friendly criteria, prioritizing recycled, renewable, and low-impact resources that reduce the carbon footprint of our builds while enhancing the buildings’ performance. R.D.M Architects is a champion of green technologies. We actively seek and implement innovations such as building-integrated photovoltaics, rainwater harvesting systems, and living green walls. Through design, we aim to reduce operational energy demand and ensure that our buildings contribute positively to the surrounding ecological context. Social and Ethical Responsibility Our commitment to ethical practice is fundamental. We maintain transparency with our clients and collaborators, ensuring that all stakeholders are treated fairly and equitably throughout the project’s development. Our firm is dedicated to the economic empowerment of the communities in which we work by supporting local labor and materials whenever possible. We offer pro bono services to underserved communities and nonprofit organizations as part of our social responsibility. This enables us to contribute architectural expertise to causes that align with our firm’s values, helping to create accessible, safe, and sustainable buildings for those who need them most. Post Occupancy Evaluation Understanding the long-term impact of our architectural solutions is critical to R.D.M Architects. We engage in post-occupancy evaluations (POEs) to assess how our buildings perform and how they are used and experienced by occupants. This feedback loop informs our practice and fuels continuous improvement in our design process. Our POEs involve both quantitative and qualitative measures. We collect data on energy consumption, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort, among other metrics. Alongside this, we gather feedback from the building’s users to understand their experiences and satisfaction levels regarding the space’s functionality and aesthetics. These evaluations are not merely perfunctory checks; they are integral tools that allow us to validate and refine our sustainability strategies. The insights from POEs empower us to evolve our designs to be more responsive to human needs, environmentally responsible, and better performing over time. They are a testament to our commitment to delivering architecture that is both future-proof and flexible, adapting to the changing needs and expectations of those it serves. In conclusion, R.D.M Architects holds itself to the highest standards of health and safety, sustainability, social and ethical responsibility, and post-occupancy evaluation. These services are not isolated offerings but are interwoven threads that form the tapestry of our practice’s ethos. We are unwavering in our dedication to crafting spaces that are not only architectural achievements but also beacons of responsible and sustainable living, today and into the future. 2 LEARNING OUTCOME & ASSESSMENT On completion of this unit you will be able to demonstrate: Learning LO5 Professional & ethical practice: understanding of the context and role of the architect, including current and emerging trends and the business principles related to running a practice.

RIBA Chartered Practice Primer3 This guide explains the key requirements that the RIBA sets as standards for Chartered Practices to help practices considering Chartered Practice status to work towards and achieve compliance. The primer includes guidance on how practices can develop and implement the policies and processes required by the RIBA listed below including why they are important, what they are for, how to comply with minimum standards, and best practice that you may wish to consider: • Staff composition and business structure • Employment • Equality, diversity and inclusion • Quality management • Environmental management • Health and safety • Dispute resolution • Insurance • CPD Template policies and systems for each of these issues can be found in the RIBA Chartered Practice Toolbox, available to all RIBA Chartered Practices, and those joining the scheme, through the RIBA Membership Team. The guide is informed by three books published recently by the RIBA, all of which make excellent reading for a new practice who want to start off on the right track and set up best practice project and business management systems and processes: • Small Practice and the Sole Practitioner by Marianne Davys • Small Projects Handbook by Nigel Ostime • Starting a Practice: A Plan of Work (2nd ed) by Simon Foxell Each of these publications contain sections on practice or project finances. A fourth publication Financial Management by Brian Pinder-Ayres provides more detail on this subject Introduction Best Practice Financial management basics: The RIBA recommends taking the following actions regarding financial management as soon as possible: • Do a cashflow of at least 6 months ahead, this should show all likely receipts and expenditure together with a running total; • Ensure you know what it costs you to perform work and produce sensible fee bids using costed resource schedules; and • Record what you do and know what the final outturn cost will be on all your projects. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer4 Strong leadership is paramount in any organisation. The RIBA requires our practices to be led by RIBA Chartered Members whose professional competence, integrity and relationships has been assured and demonstrated through their professional education, development and standards. Members must reach a high standard of professional conduct and performance. To facilitate this, Chartered Practices must abide by The RIBA Code of Practice for Chartered Practices, which is based on the three principles of our Code of Conduct for individuals of honesty and integrity, competence, and relationships. Following the guidelines will enable members to provide a service that meets the exacting standards of the Code. Guidance included with the Code of Practice provides a framework for the resolution of any misunderstandings or disputes that may arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations. As explained above, this guide covers the additional requirements that make up the professional aspects of the criteria for Chartered Practices. The processes explained below provide clear and accessible advice on adopting a best practice approach which will be widely applicable to a range of scenarios. For each of them a template policy can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Why do we set standards? RIBA Chartered Practice Primer5 For the broad protection of society and clients in the UK, the Architects Act (1997) requires all Architects’ practices to operate under the control and management of an ARB registered architect, who does not act at the same time in a similar capacity for any other organisation. The Act also requires that all work relating to architecture is carried out by or under the supervision of an ARB registered architect. To provide a high level of quality assurance, the architects controlling/managing an RIBA Chartered Practice and undertaking/overseeing the architectural work must be Chartered Members of the RIBA. The RIBA sets the minimum number of Chartered Members required per Chartered Practice relative to the total number of staff to achieve the minimum professional management and supervision requirements to deliver a high standard of service. When first setting up in practice, you will need to decide on your company structure. Very small practices will normally be Sole Traders or Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships are also used. The RIBA advises taking processional legal and financial advice before deciding on a company structure. Guidance can also be found at Companies House. Staff composition and Business structure Chartered Practice Criteria The office is a full-time architects’ office, or, a definable architectural practice business unit within a multi-functional organisation, with responsibility to ensure all practice information submitted to the RIBA is up to date and accurate. At least one of the full–time principals (Director or Partner) in the architects’ office must be a Chartered Member of the RIBA. All architectural work must be under the personal supervision of an RIBA Chartered Architect and arrangements in place to ensure work is covered in the event of their absence. RIBA Chartered Practices must meet a quality assurance standard of staff bound by a relevant code of conduct. This is based on: a minimum of 1:10 staff being Chartered Members of the RIBA; and a minimum 1:8 staff being either Registered Architects, Associate Members of the RIBA, or Affiliate Members of the RIBA. Best Practice Innovation under supervision: Consider how your processes of project supervision and design review will allow junior staff to learn and innovate within a safety net that assures the quality of your practice’s outputs. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer6 As soon as you make the decision to expand your practice beyond yourself - as a sole practitioner or the original partners – to take on a member of staff, you will need to follow employment legislation. The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide sets out the key requirements in a simple checklist based on the principles of UK legislation; UK Government has clear guidance and tools for employing people. International practices must also follow the RIBA Checklist but will also need to be aware of any requirements which conflict with or go beyond their national legislation. To ensure that all staff working for an RIBA Chartered Practice earn a wage that meets the costs of living, the RIBA requires that all staff, including freelance staff and students are paid at least the Real Living Wage, as set by the Living Wage Foundation. In order to maintain competitive levels of pay across all levels in the profession, the RIBA Business Benchmarking Survey for Chartered Practices provides data on the average salaries of all staff levels. Employment Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate an Employment Policy which addresses the requirements of the RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide This can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Enhanced employee benefits: The RIBA Chartered Practice Employment Policy Guide provides advice on additional benefits that practices may wish to consider to help improve employee satisfaction, teamwork and productivity. For more detail on the average earnings, fringe benefits and total remuneration packages being received by architects throughout the industry the RIBA and the Fees Bureau publish an annual Architects Earnings report, check the RIBA Journal for the latest articles on the results of this survey. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer7 Inclusive workplaces make architecture a fairer place for all employees, widen the pool of talent, and strengthen the profession’s effectiveness and performance. The most successful practices demonstrate that a diverse workforce and inclusive working procedures can play an important part in improving productivity and make good business sense. Benefits of this can include: • improved talent attraction and retention – people who feel respected and valued are more likely to join, stay with and perform better at an inclusive organisation; • enhanced reputation – a competitive point of difference in the market attracts clients; • diversity of thought and background – greater creativity, innovation and even constructive disagreements lead to better architecture; • greater insight into client and user needs – design is informed by and directly relevant to the people inhabiting the spaces; • better service delivery – inclusive working arrangements support better employee performance; and • compliance – an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy helps employers and service providers to meet their legal responsibilities, in the UK these can be found in The Equality Act 2010. Chartered Practices must have and maintain an appropriate Equality Diversity and Inclusion Policy, which is regularly monitored. An action plan will help you achieve your Equality, Diversity and Inclusion goals in practice. The RIBA recognises that a significant proportion of Chartered Practices do not have any employees, although they may, on occasion, employ people on a temporary or ad-hoc basis. We recommended that your policy is fit for purpose and has the flexibility to adapt to changes in circumstances. Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Social purpose and leadership: Discover the RIBA Practice Role Models, case studies about organisations that exercise a positive impact – on their people, their clients, the profession and wider society. None claim to be perfect, but there are things to be learnt from each. They are intended to provoke a profession- wide debate about what it means to be a successful RIBA Chartered Practice. The RIBA has defined the nine characteristics of a practice role model. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion RIBA Chartered Practice Primer8 Any project is a journey and becomes easier to envisage, plan and execute with a good map. What is true for a project is also true for your practice; having a management system for various functions means that the wheel need not be constantly reinvented and that consistent ways of working can be understood and adopted by everyone. When things don’t go quite according to plan on a journey, a map can become a life-saver as it allows you to find a way out of trouble – you can find where you are and then plot a route around the problem. The RIBA believes that quality management is core to the success of a business in providing quality assurance which accords with the RIBA Chartered Practice scheme. All RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an appropriate Quality Management System (QMS). This system provides a map specifically designed for the business of architecture and will enable your practice to establish a formal QMS. Leadership is essential to running an effective QMS. Directors/Partners (and senior managers) establish unity of purpose and direction of the practice. They should create and maintain the collaborative environment that enables staff to become fully involved in achieving the practice’s objectives. Quality Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a Quality Management System, relevant to the size of practice. • Small practices (up to 10 staff) are required to prepare a Project Quality Plan (PQP) for each project. • Medium practices (11 to 50 staff) are required to operate a Quality Management System that covers all project and practice procedures. • Large practices (51+ staff) are required to adopt an externally certified ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System or be working towards having one. Guidance and templates can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox Best Practice Quality assurance accreditation: Developing a full QMS that is externally accredited to BS EN ISO 9001:2015 will help demonstrate to clients that you manage the quality of your work and processes to an internationally recognised standard and improve your success at pre-qualification stage in public sector work. To achieve accreditation, it is likely that you will need help from a quality assurance professional, RIBA members can speak to an RIBA Specialist Practice Consultant for more information: 020 7307 3600 RIBA Chartered Practice Primer9 Clearly, the output of a practice will have a great impact on the environment, when considering the life of the buildings designed by the practice. RIBA Chartered Practices are required to have an Environmental Management Policy to establish a common approach to minimising environmental impact on projects and in the practice. This approach will bring many benefits, including: • internal buy in – formalising an approach to reducing the environmental impact of architecture in a policy helps to provide a framework for internal communication; a written policy ensures that design discussions are underpinned by a common understanding of environmental aspirations, obligations and targets; • clarifying processes – all good designers will naturally have a positive attitude to environmental issues built into their thinking. Writing these values? down helps to share your goals, allows others to input into processes and, with constructive criticism, can identify how environmental objectives can be better integrated into your work; • communicating to clients – success rates in public procurement, bids and informal conversations with clients, consultants, local authorities and others can be improved by communicating robust environmental policies. Ensuring that your environmental agenda is clear, transparent and legible can instil confidence in how you talk about, deliver, and how others perceive, your approach; and • driving improvements – an environmental policy is not a fixed position. It is a working frame of reference. Periodically reviewing and developing the policy to reflect legislative changes, developments in your own thinking and that of wider industry will enable constant improvements to design work and operational procedures. Environmental Management Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Environmental Management Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Whole life thinking: Consider how your practice will encompass environmental, social and economic sustainability throughout the organisation, your architecture and research so that your work is energy and resource efficient, enduring and meets a real need. Challenge yourself and others to innovate, and question current working practices and whole life thinking – including your clients, contractors and the supply chain. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer10 Health and Safety is a fundamental consideration for all architects and designers. It should be part of everyday working - activity inside the office and on every project. There is both a legal and professional responsibility to understand and apply health and safety principles at all times. Architects have further responsibilities, both legal and moral, to help reduce the devastating impact of construction activity on the workforce of the industry. 50 construction workers per year are killed at work and 100 times that later in life from chronic health conditions resulting from their work on site. A Health and Safety policy should set out the standards and principles for your practice so that these can be communicated to clients and staff. To be effective, the Health and Safety policy of any Chartered Practice must address the specific needs and requirements of that practice, its staff and its work. It is important that all staff are familiar with the contents of the policy and refer to it when appropriate. If staff members are in any doubt about the application or requirements at any time they must raise these concerns with their manager. Health and Safety Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must ensure that an appropriate Health & Safety Policy is in place and operational. Guidance and a template can be found in the Chartered Practice Toolbox. Best Practice Health and safety project leadership: The RIBA Health and Safety Policy Guide includes guidance on the Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) Regulations 2015 which introduced the role of Principal Designer. The RIBA supports the Health and Safety Executive’s position that the most appropriate organisation to fulfil the duties of the Principal Designer and make the most effective contribution to positive health and safety on the design of a project is the lead designer, which is likely to be the architecture practice, rather than a separate consultant. To improve your knowledge and confidence to undertake this role, you can read the RIBA’s detailed guidance on CDM 2015 and consider taking a course. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer11 The RIBA acknowledges that, on occasion, Chartered Practices may fall short of the exacting standards of the Code. In order to deal with possible breaches of the Code, and other concerns, the RIBA has established a clear and equitable process for dealing with complaints against Chartered Practices. The Institute also accepts that misunderstandings and disputes can arise between Chartered Practices and their clients, co-professionals and others they encounter through their professional obligations, but that these often do not amount to a breach of the Code. The RIBA has therefore also implemented a series of dispute resolution processes to assist parties in resolving these matters. Dispute Resolution and Professional Indemnity Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria As part of the Code of Practice, practices are required to have in place a written complaint handling procedure. Guidance can be found with the Code of Practice. Best Practice Responsibility and professionalism: Most disputes are caused by a failure to communicate, complete actions, deliver services or behave in ways that are expected or have been agreed upon. Contractual duties are most clear to understand in standard forms of agreement (like RIBA contracts and agreements) while your duty of care in Tort will go beyond the terms of a contract. For detailed but concise guidance refer to the RIBA publication Avoiding and Resolving Disputes: A Short Guide for Architects by Bart Kavanagh. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer12 Appropriate Professional Insurance is a requirement for architects in the UK. Starting at £250,000 at the least (as required by the ARB), practices may need more cover dependent on the type of projects they work on. Allegations of professional negligence often involve complex and detailed issues, and litigation may be expensive and traumatic. During your career, should a claim be made against you, your insurer should support you throughout this process. For more information on Professional Indemnity Insurance, visit the RIBA Insurance Agency, the only PII broker recommended by the RIBA. Insurance Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must hold Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII) cover appropriate for the work undertaken by the practice, or an equivalent form of insurance if operating outside of the UK. Guidance on PII and risk management can be found from the RIBA Insurance Agency. Best Practice Additional insurance: The RIBA recommends that practices assess they may face and have appropriate insurance to protect the business and specialist advice is sought. Beyond the requirement for Professional Indemnity Insurance, you may need insurance to cover the following: • Employers liability (a legal requirement as an employer) • Premises and contents insurance • Public liability insurance • Cyber liability insurance • Health and accident insurance • Travel insurance • Motor insurance • Insurance for specific items such as ICT and other equipment. RIBA Chartered Practice Primer13 The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Doing CPD helps you to remain competent, professional, capable and resilient as an architect. It enables RIBA members to achieve better outcomes and run better businesses. CPD also helps you to contend with disruption and to face current and future challenges as well as learn new skills and specialisms. RIBA Chartered Practices must provide the opportunity for all staff members (not just RIBA Chartered Members) to undertake CPD so that your practice can develop its knowledge. Easy compliance with this requirement can be achieved by creating a structured framework for your team’s continual learning, with a member of staff being responsible for organising CPD. CPD Chartered Practice Criteria The practice must operate a management system to ensure that architects in this office adhere to the RIBA Code of Professional Conduct and comply with Continuing Professional Development obligations. Guidance can be found on the RIBA CPD webpages. Best Practice Research and career learning: Research can be an essential part of a practice’s approach to working and can form an important element of the service offer to clients. Consider whether gaining new knowledge and information might be a significant part of your working method and how you disseminate the results internally, to your clients and to the wider profession or industry. For more information on undertaking research download our guides Knowledge and Research in Practice and Housing Research in Practice. Design research – carried out as a practice, in collaboration with other architects or through teaching - can often lead to career specialisation, opening avenues of work on new project types.

ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management. It helps organizations of all sizes and sectors to improve their performance, meet customer expectations and demonstrate their commitment to quality. Its requirements define how to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a quality management system (QMS). Implementing ISO 9001 means your organization has put in place effective processes and trained staff to deliver flawless products or services time after time. Why is ISO 9001 important? With more than one million certificates issued to organizations in 189 countries, ISO 9001 is the most widely used quality management standard in the world. Within the ISO 9000 family, which defines seven quality management principles including a strong customer focus and continual improvement, ISO 9001 is the only standard that can be certified to (though certification is not mandatory). Business benefits include: Customer confidence: The standard ensures that organizations have robust quality control processes in place, leading to increased customer trust and satisfaction. Effective complaint resolution: ISO 9001 offers guidelines for resolving customer complaints efficiently, contributing to timely and satisfactory problem-solving. Process improvement: The standard helps identify and eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, streamline operations, and promote informed decision-making, resulting in cost savings and better outcomes.

Introduction 0.1 General The adoption of a quality management system is a strategic decision for an organization that can help to improve its overall performance and provide a sound basis for sustainable development initiatives. The potential benefits to an organization of implementing a quality management system based on this International Standard are: a) the ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; b) facilitating opportunities to enhance customer satisfaction; c) addressing risks and opportunities associated with its context and objectives; d) the ability to demonstrate conformity to specified quality management system requirements. This International Standard can be used by internal and external parties. It is not the intent of this International Standard to imply the need for: — uniformity in the structure of different quality management systems; — alignment of documentation to the clause structure of this International Standard; — the use of the specific terminology of this International Standard within the organization. The quality management system requirements specified in this International Standard are complementary to requirements for products and services. This International Standard employs the process approach, which incorporates the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and risk-based thinking. The process approach enables an organization to plan its processes and their interactions. The PDCA cycle enables an organization to ensure that its processes are adequately resourced and managed, and that opportunities for improvement are determined and acted on. Risk-based thinking enables an organization to determine the factors that could cause its processes and its quality management system to deviate from the planned results, to put in place preventive controls to minimize negative effects and to make maximum use of opportunities as they arise (see Clause A.4). Consistently meeting requirements and addressing future needs and expectations poses a challenge for organizations in an increasingly dynamic and complex environment. To achieve this objective, the organization might find it necessary to adopt various forms of improvement in addition to correction and continual improvement, such as breakthrough change, innovation and re-organization. In this International Standard, the following verbal forms are used: — “shall” indicates a requirement; — “should” indicates a recommendation; — “may” indicates a permission; — “can” indicates a possibility or a capability. Information marked as “NOTE” is for guidance in understanding or clarifying the associated requirement. 0.2 Quality management principles This International Standard is based on the quality management principles described in ISO 9000. The descriptions include a statement of each principle, a rationale of why the principle is important for the organization, some examples of benefits associated with the principle and examples of typical actions to improve the organization’s performance when applying the principle. The quality management principles are: — customer focus; — leadership; — engagement of people; — process approach; — improvement; — evidence-based decision making; — relationship management. 0.3 Process approach 0.3.1 General This International Standard promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system, to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements. Specific requirements considered essential to the adoption of a process approach are included in 4.4. Understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization’s effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its intended results. This approach enables the organization to control the interrelationships and interdependencies among the processes of the system, so that the overall performance of the organization can be enhanced. The process approach involves the systematic definition and management of processes, and their interactions, so as to achieve the intended results in accordance with the quality policy and strategic direction of the organization. Management of the processes and the system as a whole can be achieved using the PDCA cycle (see 0.3.2) with an overall focus on risk-based thinking (see 0.3.3) aimed at taking advantage of opportunities and preventing undesirable results. The application of the process approach in a quality management system enables: a) understanding and consistency in meeting requirements; b) the consideration of processes in terms of added value; c) the achievement of effective process performance; d) improvement of processes based on evaluation of data and information. Figure 1 gives a schematic representation of any process and shows the interaction of its elements. The monitoring and measuring check points, which are necessary for control, are specific to each process and will vary depending on the related risks. Figure 1 — Schematic representation of the elements of a single process 0.3.2 Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle The PDCA cycle can be applied to all processes and to the quality management system as a whole. Figure 2 illustrates how Clauses 4 to 10 can be grouped in relation to the PDCA cycle. Figure 2 — Representation of the structure of this International Standard in the PDCA cycle NOTE Numbers in brackets refer to the clauses in this International Standard. The PDCA cycle can be briefly described as follows: — Plan: establish the objectives of the system and its processes, and the resources needed to deliver results in accordance with customers’ requirements and the organization’s policies, and identify and address risks and opportunities; — Do: implement what was planned; — Check: monitor and (where applicable) measure processes and the resulting products and services against policies, objectives, requirements and planned activities, and report the results; — Act: take actions to improve performance, as necessary. 0.3.3 Risk-based thinking Risk-based thinking (see Clause A.4) is essential for achieving an effective quality management system. The concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard including, for example, carrying out preventive action to eliminate potential nonconformities, analysing any nonconformities that do occur, and taking action to prevent recurrence that is appropriate for the effects of the nonconformity. To conform to the requirements of this International Standard, an organization needs to plan and implement actions to address risks and opportunities. Addressing both risks and opportunities establishes a basis for increasing the effectiveness of the quality management system, achieving improved results and preventing negative effects. Opportunities can arise as a result of a situation favourable to achieving an intended result, for example, a set of circumstances that allow the organization to attract customers, develop new products and services, reduce waste or improve productivity. Actions to address opportunities can also include consideration of associated risks. Risk is the effect of uncertainty and any such uncertainty can have positive or negative effects. A positive deviation arising from a risk can provide an opportunity, but not all positive effects of risk result in opportunities. 0.4 Relationship with other management system standards This International Standard applies the framework developed by ISO to improve alignment among its International Standards for management systems (see Clause A.1). This International Standard enables an organization to use the process approach, coupled with the PDCA cycle and risk-based thinking, to align or integrate its quality management system with the requirements of other management system standards. This International Standard relates to ISO 9000 and ISO 9004 as follows: — ISO 9000 Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary provides essential background for the proper understanding and implementation of this International Standard; — ISO 9004 Managing for the sustained success of an organization — A quality management approach provides guidance for organizations that choose to progress beyond the requirements of this International Standard. Annex B provides details of other International Standards on quality management and quality management systems that have been developed by ISO/TC 176. This International Standard does not include requirements specific to other management systems, such as those for environmental management, occupational health and safety management, or financial management. Sector-specific quality management system standards based on the requirements of this International Standard have been developed for a number of sectors. Some of these standards specify additional quality management system requirements, while others are limited to providing guidance to the application of this International Standard within the particular sector. A matrix showing the correlation between the clauses of this edition of this International Standard and the previous edition (ISO 9001:2008) can be found on the ISO/TC 176/SC 2 open access web site at: www.iso.org/tc176/sc02/public. 1 Scope This International Standard specifies requirements for a quality management system when an organization: a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. All the requirements of this International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type or size, or the products and services it provides. NOTE 1 In this International Standard, the terms “product” or “service” only apply to products and services intended for, or required by, a customer. NOTE 2 Statutory and regulatory requirements can be expressed as legal requirements. 2 Normative references The following documents, in whole or in part, are normatively referenced in this document and are indispensable for its application.

Stages of Work Useful Links riba-stagesThere are key stages of work to every project from the inception through to completion, and even beyond. Understanding the various stages of a construction project, what happens at each stage, and then implementing this structure is fundamental to the success of a project. It is good practice for Architects to work in accordance with the most recent RIBA Plan of Work which sets out the various work stages as follows: 0 - Strategic Definition 1 - Preparation and Brief 2 - Concept Design 3 - Developed Design 4 - Technical Design Tendering 5 - Construction 6 - Handover and Close Out 7 - In Use riba-stages-0-red-squirrel-architects Stage 0 Pre-appointment: Following your initial enquiry – prior to being appointed – we will visit the site and meet with you to discuss the project and your requirements. In this initial meeting we will also discuss your budget, and timescales for the project; as well as explaining which services we can provide and which services are appropriate for your project. Following the initial meeting we will compile a fee proposal and a schedule of services which – if agreed – will form the basis of our appointment as your architect. Generally speaking we do not charge for services at the pre-appointment stage. Post appointment: Once appointed we will compile a more detailed project programme and we will formalise the ‘Strategic Brief’ for the project.

To create the model i used coffee sticks and stuck them together to create the illusion of timber, then i used a cardboard cutter to cut out curves, each layer getting thinner than the next, this also gave the impression of hills and natural geography. After the 1:100 model i began to think up new ideas to improve upon the origi- nal, I decided to expand on the idea of the pavilion being seemingly part of the earth, however i wanted it to stand out, so I did research on natural forms of the planet and was inspired by the Huangshan mountains of China and the beauti- ful muntainscapes they created. With that i started by creating natural mountain esc shapes (Fig 31.) and compared them to a human scale. I tried imagining them next to each other and how an elevation of the pavilion would look, idealy like a scenic view of a mountain range. I then proceeded to draw up the pavillion from different angles to see how it would look ideally, I then found that the indent of the curves of the walls made for good areas for curved seats encouraging social encounters and a friendlier design. The final design can be seen the floor plans and elevation sketches. When first thinking of a material to use, my emedient thaught to a natural, mountainscape looking pavilion was granite, however i found that the material wasnt that sustainable and hard to move around, so i researched a material recommended to me by my teacher which was rammed earth. Rammed earth involves compacting natural raw materials like earth, chalk, lime, or gravel. It is an ancient method that has recently been well-liked as a green building method. Compared to other construction methods that rely more heavily on cement and other chemicals, rammed earth structures are both strong- er and more environmentally friendly. Buildings made of rammed earth typically have little embodied energy and produce very little waste since they employ locally accessible resources. Subsoil usu- ally surrounds topsoil to safeguard it for agricultural use. Energy and transportation costs are decreased when the dirt removed to prepare a foundation may be reused. The most popular and environmentally friendly building material and method for creating sturdy structures today is rammed earth. The amount of cement used and how much of it is sourced locally will affect the material’s potential industrial impact because mined aggregates rather than “earth” are often used to con- struct rammed earth. The final model turned out just as the planning sketches had presented them, i used cardboard as my material, ideally i would have used a cement cast however im not too well versed in the materi- al so i chose an easier more flexible material, that being cardboard. i cut a slitted line pattern onto the cardboard to make it more flexible and created the curves to slit the seates in between. i placed the model onto a flat cardboard surface in order to show how the full pavilion would look. Here i used the 1:100 model as well as the site model to measure out and create a front and side elevation of my pavilion. I used a 1:100 scale ruler as well as pictures of the site to try visualise the location of my pa- vilion. I also added trees to further help realise the model in its context. I contemplated adding human figures to the drawings but ultimately didnt in fear that it would stand out too much compared to the pavilion.","completion":"**Project Case Study: Canford Heath Pavilion** **Project Overview** The Canford Heath Pavilion, envisioned by R.D.M Architects, is a masterclass in harmonious design, where architecture complements the natural landscape, serving both as a landmark and a nurturer of community interaction. Inspired by the organic majesty of the Huangshan mountains, the Pavilion is not just a structure but a confluence of art, function, and environment. **Design Philosophy** The genesis of the Pavilion’s design evolved from an organic concept where timber layers, each progressively thinner, created a natural amphitheater of steps blending seamlessly with the terrain. These geologically inspired steps provided a multitude of social spaces without detracting from the natural beauty of Canford Heath and appeared as though they were a natural extension of the land. Initial modeling of the Pavilion was accomplished with humble coffee sticks and strategic cuts of cardboard, simulating the undulating forms of the earth and the gradual ascent of a mountainscape. The Pavilion's layers mirrored the rhythmic rise and fall of hills, while its curved contours formed niches reminiscent of the earth’s topographical variances. **Material Innovation** Originally, granite surfaced as the primary material consideration for its strength and aesthetic that echoed mountain facades. Yet, its sustainability was questioned. Upon further exploration, and a recommendation by a seasoned academic, R.D.M Architects decided upon rammed earth for its low environmental footprint and regional relevance. Rammed earth, with its tactile stratification and natural pigmentations, brought an ecological narrative to the project—a structure built from the earth, by the earth. This technique not only salvages the topsoil for continued agricultural use but also reduces energy and transportation dependencies by utilising the excavated materials from the foundation works, embodying R.D.M Architects' core sustainable ethos. **Design Features** Agile adaptations during the design process led to the inclusion of sweeping curves within the walls, creating congenial spaces for community gatherings. It was these curved recesses that spontaneously evolved into cozy seating areas, promoting an environment of social warmth and inclusivity. The Pavilion's final design, detailed in meticulous floor plans and elevations, presents the embodiment of an architectonic mountain range offering scenic views. While committed to its overarching ecological narrative, the Pavilion remains functional, aesthetically enriching, and culturally significant. **Model Realization** The Pavilion’s final model was a direct translation of the planning sketches—a testament to rigorous design methodologies employed by R.D.M Architects. Cardboard was chosen for its pliability, facilitating the crafting of the intricate curves and allowing for a slit pattern technique that introduced flexibility where required. This final model was then set amidst a contextual terrain of miniature trees without the addition of scale figures, maintaining the Pavilion’s aesthetic fidelity without undue distraction. **Conclusion** The Canford Heath Pavilion represents a step forward in design philosophy where integration with the natural environment is the cornerstone. Through its innovative use of materials like rammed earth and design that promotes social interaction, R.D.M Architects have reinforced their commitment to creating structures that are sustainable, functional, and visually harmonious within their settings."},{"prompt":"独自在古堡生活的剪刀手爱德华，被一位推销化妆品的女子佩格误闯城堡带回家后，与佩格的女儿相恋却无法在一起的悲剧童话故事。写几篇剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记","completion":"剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（一） 亲爱的日记， 今天，我遇到了一位专门推销化妆品的女子，她叫佩格。她非常热情地拜访了我的古堡，并误闯了我的领域。起初，我感到有些不安，不过很快我们就成了好朋友。她喜欢用各种奇怪的颜色涂抹在我那十分剪刀化的手指上，然后用她自己研制的化妆品打造出奇特的艺术品。我从来没有经历过这样的事情，但是它让我感到非常兴奋和幸福。 佩格有一个可爱的女儿，叫金妮。她是一位活泼可爱，充满好奇心的小姑娘。每次我和她见面，我都能看到她那双炯炯有神的大眼睛向我投来好奇的目光。我们会一起探索城堡的每个角落，她会告诉我关于城堡历史的有趣故事，而我则为她展示我的剪刀手艺术。虽然我们无法亲密接触，但我们的心始终是紧紧相连的。 然而，我很遗憾地告诉你，我们永远也不能真正地在一起。我的剪刀手不仅使我无法触摸任何东西，也成为了我们之间的隔阂。我可以感受到金妮对我的爱，但我无法回报她。这是一场悲剧，我深陷其中。 尽管如此，我依然感到幸运能够认识佩格和金妮。她们让我的生活变得丰富多彩，带给我无尽的欢笑和惊喜。我会珍惜和她们在一起的每一刻，尽管我们不能彼此拥抱，但我们的灵魂已经相互依存。 愿我的剪刀手艺和我们美好的回忆能够永远留在佩格和金妮的心中。 剪刀手爱德华 剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（二） 亲爱的日记， 今天，我又经历了一次让人心跳加速的冒险。我决定用我的剪刀手艺来帮助人们。有一位名叫格拉德斯的邻居喜欢养刺猬，但每次她想摸摸它们的刺，总是被戳痛。我想，或许我能帮到她。 于是，我小心翼翼地走进了她的花园。格拉德斯有些害怕地看着我，当我展示我的剪刀手艺时，她忍不住发出一声惊呼。尽管如此，她还是鼓起勇气，把手伸向我。我轻轻地用剪刀手剪下她跟刺猬刺接触到的部分，让她不再受伤。她欢呼雀跃起来，感激地抱住我。这是我第一次感受到像样的拥抱，尽管只是短暂的一刹那。 之后，更多的邻居们听说了我的剪刀手艺，纷纷前来向我求助。有人想夹住飞得太高的风筝线，有人想修剪叶子上的杂草，还有人希望我能为他们剪出一件独特的艺术品。我感到自己在这个小镇上变得无比重要，而这些人们的笑容则是我获得满足感的最好回报。 虽然我无法像普通人那样使用双手，但是我的剪刀手却给我带来了与众不同的人生。我将继续用我的剪刀手艺帮助他人，让他们感受到生活的美好和希望。 剪刀手爱德华 剪刀手爱德华有趣新奇的日记（三） 亲爱的日记， 今天，佩格邀请我去她家参加一场派对。这是我第一次参加这样的社交活动，我内心充满了紧张和兴奋。 派对上的每个人都穿着华丽的礼服，戴着华丽的饰品，对我来说简直像是一个童话般的世界。佩格一直拉着我参观了每一个房间，介绍每个人给我认识。虽然他们对我的剪刀手有些害怕，但他们的好奇心和善意充斥着整个房间。 舞池上，一个名叫约翰的绅士向我走了过来，邀请我和他一起跳舞。虽然我并不擅长舞蹈，但约翰一直带着微笑和耐心地教我跳舞的技巧。我们两个像是在享受一次特别的旋转和起伏的冒险。尽管我的剪刀手非常尴尬，但我们的舞姿却充满了自由和美感。 整个派对充满了快乐和欢笑。我在这里遇到了许多有趣的人，他们对我打开了心扉，接受了我的独特之处。我终于明白，尽管我的剪刀手让我与世界有所隔阂，但它也成为了我融入这个世界的通行证。我学会了用自己独特的方式与人交流，用我的剪刀手来创造美和快乐。 虽然这个派对结束了，但我将永远铭记着这个美好而又充满魔幻色彩的夜晚。我收获了许多宝贵的友谊和美好的回忆。我深深地感激佩格和她的家人，给了我一个独一无二的机会，让我有机会尽情展现我的剪刀手艺。 剪刀手爱德华"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Natsuki: (angrily glancing at Yuri’s baby bump) “Well, it took YOU long enough to get here.

The room fills with a mix of relief and awe.) Natsuki: (teary-eyed) \\"Yuri... you did it. You gave birth to a beautiful baby.\\" (Yuri collapses onto the floor, exhausted but filled with joy. Natsuki quickly wraps the baby in a clean towel and places them in Yuri's arms.) Natsuki: (softly) \\"Congratulations, Yuri. You're a mother now.\\" (They can hear the distant wailing of the ambulance siren growing closer.) Yuri: (whispering, tears streaming down her face) \\"Thank you, Natsuki.

We're friends, and friends support each other no matter what.\\" (The ambulance arrives, paramedics rushing in to assess the situation.

His death led to a power vacuum that ultimately allowed Major General Chun Doo-hwan (often spelled Jeon Doo-hwan) to seize power through a military coup in December 1979, followed by a series of events known as the Coup d'état of December Twelfth. It's speculative to consider what might have happened had Park Chung-hee remained alive. If he had continued his presidency and maintained a strong grip on power, it's possible that conditions for Chun Doo-hwan's rise to power might not have materialized in the same way. Park's rule was characterized by authoritarianism, and despite his assassination, there was an existing strong military influence within South Korean politics. Park Chung-hee's government had also faced significant public opposition and protest towards the end of his leadership. Moreover, historical contingencies are subject to a vast array of factors. The motivations and opportunities for Chun Doo-hwan to stage a coup were tied closely to political dynamics post-1979; without Park Chung-hee's assassination, these dynamics would have been quite different. Chun's ascent to power might have been less likely or might not have happened at all. Still, without detailed alternate history analysis (which is inherently speculative), it is difficult to convincingly argue what could have occurred in such a complex political landscape."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},O={key:1};function B(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):h("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
