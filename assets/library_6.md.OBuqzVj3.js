Вы добавляете новые уникальные символы в \`unique_simbols\`, только если имя уже присутствует в дереве. Однако, так как вы сравниваете имена, используя операторы \`<\` и \`>\`, есть вероятность, что при вставке контакта с таким же именем, но другим регистром (строчные/заглавные буквы), он воспринимается как новый контакт. V результат, он не вносит свой вклад в \`unique_simbols\`, что может привести к ошибке в тесте. Еще Ваша программа не справляется с ситуацией, когда она получает имена в различных регистрах, например \\"Petya\\" и \\"petya\\". Программа должна интерпретировать их как одно и то же имя, так как они состоят из тех же уникальных символов, и добавлять символы только один раз. Давайте мы попытаемся улучшить программу, чтобы она корректно обрабатывала имена в различных регистрах: 1. Преобразуйте строки в нижний регистр, прежде чем вставлять их в дерево. 2. Проверяйте на дубликаты, используя преобразованное имя. Вот исправленная версия функции \`Insert\` с учетом преобразования строки в нижний регистр: \`\`\`cpp #include <cctype> // Для функции tolower // Эта функция конвертирует строку в нижний регистр std::string toLower(const std::string& str) { std::string lower_str; for (char c : str) { lower_str += std::tolower(c); } return lower_str; } void Insert(Node*& root, std::string name, std::vector<char>& unique_simbols) { if (!root) { for (char c : name) { if (find(unique_simbols, std::tolower(c)) == false) { // Перед использованием делаем символы в нижнем регистре unique_simbols.push_back(std::tolower(c)); // Также сохраняем в нижнем регистре } } root = new Node(name); return; } // Преобразуем имя в нижний регистр перед сравнением name = toLower(name); if (name.compare(toLower(root->name)) < 0) { Insert(root->left, name, unique_simbols); } else if (name.compare(toLower(root->name)) > 0) { Insert(root->right, name, unique_simbols); } // Остальная часть функции остается прежней } \`\`\` И последнее замечание, функция \`Insert\` должна принимать имя уже преобразованное в нижний регистр, чтобы не делать это многократно при каждом сравнении. Это более эффективно с точки зрения производительности. Теперь, обновите \`main\` функцию для использования \`toLower\` перед вызовом \`Insert\`: \`\`\`cpp int main() { int n; std::cin >> n; std::vector<char> unique_simbols; Node* root = nullptr; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::string name; std::cin >> name; Insert(root, toLower(name), unique_simbols); // Преобразуем в нижний регистр здесь } std::cout << unique_simbols.size(); } \`\`\` Примите к сведению, что после этих изменений нужно соответствующим образом обновить и другие части кода, которые зависят от регистра символов.

Вот исправленный код с реализацией, которая будет добавлять уникальные символы из каждого контакта: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <string> #include <vector> struct Node { std::string name; Node* left = nullptr; Node* right = nullptr; int height = 1; Node(const std::string& name) : name(name) {} }; int height(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return root->height; } int Balance(Node* root) { if (root == nullptr) return 0; return height(root->left) - height(root->right); } Node* RightRotation(Node* y) { Node* x = y->left; Node* T2 = x->right; x->right = y; y->left = T2; y->height = std::max(height(y->left), height(y->right)) + 1; x->height = std::max(height(x->left), height(x->right)) + 1; return x; } Node* LeftRotation(Node* x) { Node* y = x->right; Node* T2 = y->left; y->left = x; x->right = T2; x->height = std::max(height(x->left), height(x->right)) + 1; y->height = std::max(height(y->left), height(y->right)) + 1; return y; } bool find(std::vector<char>& arr, char eq_ch) { for (auto ch : arr) { if (ch == eq_ch) return true; } return false; } void AddUniqueSymbols(const std::string& name, std::vector<char>& unique_simbols) { for (auto ch : name) { if (!find(unique_simbols, ch)) { unique_simbols.push_back(ch); } } } Node* Insert(Node* root, const std::string& name, std::vector<char>& unique_simbols) { if (!root) { AddUniqueSymbols(name, unique_simbols); return new Node(name); } if (name < root->name) { root->left = Insert(root->left, name, unique_simbols); } else if (name > root->name) { root->right = Insert(root->right, name, unique_simbols); } // ... Убедитесь, что переменная \`root->height\` и другие части функции здесь обновляются .... int balance = Balance(root); // Реализация балансировки AVL-дерева ... return root; // Возвращаем корень для предотвращения потери ссылки в рекурсии } int main() { int n; std::cin >> n; std::vector<char> unique_simbols; Node* root = nullptr; for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) { std::string name; std::cin >> name; root = Insert(root, name, unique_simbols); } std::cout << unique_simbols.size() << std::endl; } \`\`\` Теперь функция \`Insert\` проводит корректное вставление уникальных символов для каждого нового имени контакта перед добавлением узлов в дерево. Кроме того, функция теперь возвращает \`root\` для каждого вызова, сохраняя правильную структуру дерева после каждой операции вставки или балансировки. Обратите внимание, что я добавил функцию \`AddUniqueSymbols\`, которая обрабатывает добавление символов в \`unique_simbols\` перед созданием нового узла дерева. Этот код должен теперь работать корректно для вашей задачи. Если тест все равно не проходит, возможно, проблема связана с чтением входных данных или в логике AVL-дерева."},{"prompt":"用英语润色：A total of 11 clusters were found, including 7 clusters for macrophages, two for monocytes, one for dendritic cells, and one for cycling cells (figure 6A).

Voici plusieurs façons dont les réseaux sociaux ont transformé l'individu en un objet communicationnel : 1. **Visibilité et présentation de soi :** - Sur les réseaux sociaux, les individus créent des profils qui sont des vitrines de leurs intérêts, activités, relations et opinions. Cela fait de chaque individu un émetteur d’informations et un potentiel influenceur, quel que soit le nombre de ses followers. 2. **Génération de contenu :** - Les utilisateurs ne sont pas seulement des consommateurs de contenu, mais aussi des créateurs. Chacun peut publier des textes, des photos, des vidéos, contribuant ainsi au flux constant d'informations. Ce contenu peut être partagé, commenté et liké, multipliant ainsi sa portée. 3. **Personnalisation et ciblage publicitaire :** - Les plateformes de réseaux sociaux collectent des données sur les utilisateurs pour offrir un ciblage publicitaire précis. Les individus deviennent des cibles pour les entreprises qui cherchent à promouvoir leurs produits ou services. Cette dimension fait de l'individu un objet de valeur pour les annonceurs. 4. **Interaction et engagement :** - Les utilisateurs deviennent des acteurs de la communication en interagissant avec d’autres comptes. Chaque comment, partage ou mention étend le réseau de communication et augmente la visibilité des messages. 5. **Construction sociale et identitaire :** - Les réseaux sociaux permettent aux utilisateurs de se construire une image sociale et professionnelle. Cette construction est souvent influencée par la perception que l’individu souhaite que les autres aient de lui, ce qui le rend acteur et sujet de la communication. 6. **Effet de réseau et viralité :** - La présence et l'activité de chaque utilisateur contribuent à l'effet de réseau. Un contenu peut devenir viral par le simple fait que les utilisateurs le partagent en masse, faisant d'une personne une part intégrante d'un phénomène communicationnel beaucoup plus large. 7. **Surveillance et analyse sentimentale :** - Avec la surveillance des comportements en ligne et l’analyse sentimentale, les opinions exprimées par les individus sur les réseaux sociaux deviennent des données analysables pour les entreprises et les organisations. Cela permet de décrypter les perceptions et les attitudes du public. En résumé, les réseaux sociaux transforment l'individu en un objet communicationnel à travers la création et la diffusion de contenu, l’interaction avec d’autres utilisateurs, la personnalisation des expériences via la publicité, et le rôle qu'il joue dans l'économie de l’attention. Les individus ne sont pas simplement des consommateurs passifs d'informations, mais des participants actifs dans la génération, la propagation, et parfois, l'orientation du discours sur ces plateformes."},{"prompt":"Je suis étudiante en licence d’information-communication et je dois faire un dossier de quatre pages dans le cadre de la matière industries cultuelles.

Однако, с развитием международной торговли возникают и проблемы в импорте телефонных аппаратов. В данном докладе мы рассмотрим основные проблемы такого импорта и перспективы их решения. Основные проблемы импорта телефонных аппаратов: 1. Доступность: Некоторые производители телефонных аппаратов могут быть недоступными для импорта в определенные страны из-за ограничений на торговлю, политических причин или низкой конкуренции на рынке. Это может создавать не только проблемы для потребителей, но и ставить под угрозу развитие отрасли в целом. 2. Качество: Важным аспектом при импорте телефонных аппаратов является их качество. Некачественные устройства могут стать источником проблем для потребителей и нанести ущерб репутации производителя. Поэтому важно обратить внимание на проверку качества перед импортом и установить соответствующие стандарты. 3. Цены: Импорт телефонных аппаратов может быть связан с высокими накладными расходами, такими как таможенные пошлины, налоги и затраты на доставку. Кроме того, в зависимости от валютных колебаний, цены на импортируемые телефоны могут значительно вырасти, что может отпугнуть потенциальных покупателей. Перспективы решения проблем импорта телефонных аппаратов: 1. Введение свободной торговли: Соглашения о свободной торговле между странами могут способствовать более легкому импорту телефонных аппаратов и снижению торговых барьеров. Такие соглашения могут способствовать росту экономики и увеличению доступности качественных телефонов. 2. Ужесточение контроля качества: Государства должны нести ответственность за контроль качества импортируемых устройств и налагать штрафы на производителей, нарушающих соответствующие стандарты. Это поможет защитить потребителей и содействовать развитию надежных поставщиков на рынке. 3. Внедрение новых технологий: Производители должны продолжать инвестировать в исследования и развитие новых технологий, чтобы обеспечить конкурентоспособность своих продуктов на мировом рынке. Это поможет привлечь больше потребителей и повысить интерес к их товару.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"It was an unusually quiet day at the SCP Foundation —a multi-national organization that contained and studied supernatural entities and phenomena known as SCPs, standing for Special Containment Procedures. The calm was interrupted by the creaking of the heavy steel door at the facility's main briefing room. Sans the skeleton from the underground world known as Undertale casually leaned against the doorframe. Sometimes, his laid-back demeanor belied his importance to the team, but he was undeniably one of the most effective at diffusing situations with his unique blend of powers and quick wit. \\"heya, looks like we're the early birds, huh?\\" Sans remarked, looking over to where GLaDOS, the AI from the Aperture Science Laboratories, sat affixed to a wall. Her mechanical chassis allowed her to interface with the Foundation's systems directly. GLaDOS's single eye flickered in response. \\"Your determination to be punctual is noted, but I must say, it's probably an anomaly. Unfortunately, abnormalities are something I'm also in charge of keeping track of here.\\" A moment later, the door on the other side of the room opened, and in stepped Bass—a powerful combat robot from the world of Mega Man. His heavy boots clanked against the metallic floor as a red glare emitted from his visor scanned the room. He was not one for patience or chit-chat. \\"Report. What's the situation? I'm not built to rust in here.\\" Before anyone could respond, the final member of this motley crew slouched in, his expression eternally grim—one Max Payne, an ex-cop with a tragic past who somehow had ended up working alongside these beings that challenged the very fabric of reality. The stubble on his face, the leather jacket, and his slower gait made him seem out of place in this high-tech environment, yet his sharp insights had proven essential. Max's gravelly voice broke the silence, \\"Hope we're not gathering for coffee and cake. What's the scoop?\\" GLaDOS’s circuits lightly hummed as she accessed the morning's briefing notes. \\"We have an assignment. SCP-682 has shown signs of increased activity. If you're unfamiliar—which you shouldn't be, given that I downloaded all pertinent data to your terminals—SCP-682 is a large, indestructible, reptilian creature of unknown origin with a pronounced hatred for all life.\\" Bass shifted his stance, his internal systems warming at the prospect of action. \\"Combat. Finally, something that's straightforward.\\" Sans chuckled softly, shaking his skull, \\"let's not get too excited, pal. every time we've tangled with that big lizard, things have gotten kinda... 'hairy.'\\" His eye sockets flared with a blue glow as he recalled the last encounter with the dangerous creature. Max frowned, gently rubbing the bridge of his nose as if to ward off an oncoming headache. \\"Our goal is containment, not annihilation. We're not here to add to our nightmares.\\" \\"Well said, Max. However, perhaps it's time to see if the unstoppable force can meet an immovable object,\\" GLaDOS added with an undertone of sarcasm. \\"We are going to try something new today.\\" The four of them gathered around the holo-table as GLaDOS orchestrated the briefing. Layers of translucent data painted a comprehensive plan, illustrating the containment cell modifications that were to be enacted to enhance the chances of successfully detaining SCP-682 again. Sans's expression turned serious—one of the rare instances where his laid-back demeanor gave way to the grim reality of their mission. \\"alright, game plan. bass, you're on front-line defense. your buster's got the best chance of keeping 682 at bay.\\" Bass nodded sharply, his buster arm reforming into its cannon configuration momentarily before returning to normal as if eager to get started. \\"Max, your experience as an investigator might be the key to anticipating 682's moves,\\" GLaDOS continued, her voice stripped of its usual mockery. \\"Plus, your reflexes have always been impressive.\\" Max gave a half nod, his eyes never leaving the shifting images on the table. \\"Predicting the movements of a creature from hell isn't exactly what I was trained for, but I've seen enough to know you never bet on the odds in a place like this.\\" Sans turned back, his eyesockets gleaming a little brighter, \\"i'll stick to support. maybe throw in a bad joke or two to lighten the mood. if things go south, i've got a shortcut or two up my sleeve.\\" GLaDOS then focused her optic on herself, \\"I’ll be coordinating from here, streaming data from every corner to give you real-time updates. We can't afford to lose ground on this one.\\" As the mismatched team completed their preparations and readied their gear, the tension in the air grew palpable. They were about to reintroduce chaos into a system designed for order, and the outcome was anything but certain. The operation kicked off with surgical precision. GLaDOS oversaw the opening of SCP-682's containment chamber remotely while Max and Bass stood ready just outside the bulkhead door. Sans held back, preparing contingencies for a variety of unpredictable scenarios. Bass leaped into action the moment the door slid open, his powerful buster firing concentrated blasts of energy, aiming to herd the creature back into its containment zone. SCP-682 roared defiantly, retaliating with corrosive spit and thrashing limbs that could crush bones like twigs. \\"Careful, it's learning your patterns!\\" Max shouted as he dodged a devastating swipe from the creature's massive claws, returning fire with a cocktail of ammunition designed to subdue rather than kill. Sans, keeping a watchful gaze from his vantage point, teleported quickly around the battleground, creating momentary distractions—bones springing from the ground here, a well-timed pun there—all to keep SCP-682 off balance. \\"transition to phase two!\\" GLaDOS's electronic voice commanded, the walls of the containment area morphing and shifting to create new obstacles, each designed to slow down and disorient the creature. The hours stretched on, and fatigue began to set in. The team's coordination, however, only tightened as they adjusted and adapted to each other's movements. Eventually, using a combination of raw firepower, Max's cunning distractions, Sans's teleportation, and GLaDOS's environmental manipulations, they successfully forced SCP-682 back into a reconstructed cell that incorporated new hybrid technology gleaned from the combined universes of the assembled team. Once the cell was sealed, the team slumped against the walls and floors, catching their breath. Battle-weary and exhausted, each felt a sense of accomplishment that transcended their diverse origins. Max offered a tired but genuine smile, \\"Not bad for a bunch of misfits, huh?\\" Bass retracted his cannon arm, nodding with respect, \\"Efficient teamwork. Under different circumstances, it might have been interesting to test our mettle against each other.\\" Sans grinned, \\"hey, i'm glad we're on the same side. who knew a day at the office could be this exciting?\\" GLaDOS concluded the debriefing: \\"Congratulations are in order. You have managed to re-contain one of the most dangerous beings in our custody. Rest up. We have an entire catalog of anomalies that may require our... special touch.\\" The team disassembled, each heading to their quarters or duty stations, knowing that in the SCP Foundation, peace was a temporary condition. But for now, they celebrated a rare victory against chaos, brought together by the peculiar circumstance of their very existence."},{"prompt":"Short comment on a product that looks delicious","completion":"This product looks absolutely mouthwatering!

From the conversation, it seems that when A asked B what they wanted to eat and B responded with \\"Hamburger,\\" B reasonably expected that A was gathering this information to place an order according to their preference. A, however, did not explicitly state that they would order a hamburger based on B's answer, and so when A ordered pizza instead, B felt that their expressed preference was disregarded. If A was just making conversation and had no intention of considering B's preference, it would have been considerate to clarify that at the time of the question to prevent any misunderstanding. While there is no explicit \\"wrong\\" behavior here since intentions are unclear, there is certainly an error in communication. It would generally be considered inconsiderate for A to ask B what they want to eat without the intention of using that information to order food that matches B's preference, especially if A was responsible for the food order. To resolve such situations, clear communication is key. A should have stated their intent when asking the question, and B could have asked for confirmation about the food order if they had a specific preference."},{"prompt":"Пропиши диалог телефонных переговоров студента \\"Кировского авиационного техникума\\" с работодателем.","completion":"Студент: Здравствуйте, я звоню из Кировского авиационного техникума.

Если налоговая инспекция проведет аудит и выявит уклонение от налогов, то Асталче будет вынуждена как выплатить налоги на незадекларированную часть дохода, так и заплатить штраф – 13% с каждой д.е. незадекларированного дохода.

Каков результат размышлений Асталче – какую максимальную сумму она готова была бы скрыть от налоговой инспекции?","completion":"Для определения максимальной суммы, которую Асталче готова скрыть от налоговой инспекции, мы должны учесть не только ее предпочтения, но и штрафы и вероятность проведения аудита. По условию задачи, Асталче может указать в налоговой декларации сумму, меньшую своего дохода, но не может указать сумму, превышающую ее доход. Это означает, что максимальная сумма, которую она готова скрыть, равна разнице между ее доходом и суммой, которую она декларирует. Для того чтобы определить, какая сумма будет максимальной для скрытия, мы сравним ожидаемую полезность от скрытой суммы с ожидаемой полезностью, если дополнительная сумма будет обнаружена и взиманы штрафы. Сумма скрытия будет максимальна, если ожидаемая полезность от скрытой суммы больше, чем ожидаемая полезность с учетом штрафов. Для начала вычислим ожидаемую полезность от скрытой суммы. Поскольку Асталче использует элементарную функцию полезности, возьмем логарифмическую функцию полезности для расчетов: u(x) = ln(x) Где x - сумма, которую она декларирует. Теперь рассмотрим следующие случаи: 1) Аудит проводится и скрытая сумма обнаруживается: - Асталче заплатит штраф в размере 13% от незадекларированных денег. - Ожидаемая полезность (ЕП1) = u(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) 2) Аудит проводится и скрытая сумма не обнаруживается: - Ожидаемая полезность (ЕП2) = u(182 - x) 3) Аудит не проводится: - Ожидаемая полезность (ЕП3) = u(182) Теперь мы можем сравнить значения ожидаемой полезности и выбрать максимальное значение. Если ЕП1 > ЕП2 и ЕП1 > ЕП3, то максимальная сумма для скрытия будет 182 - x, где ЕП1 достигает максимума. Будем считать: u(x) = ln(x) ЕП1 = u(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) ЕП2 = u(182 - x) ЕП3 = u(182) = ln(182) Сравнивая значения, мы можем выбрать максимальное: ЕП1 = ln(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) ЕП2 = ln(182 - x) ЕП3 = ln(182) Теперь найдем максимальное значение: ЕП1 > ЕП2 и ЕП1 > ЕП3 ln(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) > ln(182 - x) и ln(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) > ln(182) Отбросим ln(182 - x) на обеих сторонах неравенства: - 0.13(182 - x) > 0 и - 0.13(182 - x) > ln(182) - ln(182 - x) Так как - 0.13(182 - x) > 0 относительно x, это неравенство всегда верно. Теперь рассмотрим второй случай: - 0.13(182 - x) > ln(182) - ln(182 - x) - 0.13(182 - x) > ln(182/(182 - x)) Теперь решим это неравенство: -0.13(182 - x) > ln(182/(182 - x)) Упростим: -23.66 + 0.13x > ln(182/(182 - x)) Теперь найдем x: ln(182/(182 - x)) < -23.66 + 0.13x Это неравенство нельзя решить аналитически, поэтому необходимо использовать численные методы для нахождения решения. Таким образом, результат размышлений Асталче зависит от решения этого неравенства и требует дальнейших вычислений."},{"prompt":"Пропиши диалог по телефонным переговорам студента \\"Кировского авиационного техникума\\" с работодателем.","completion":"Диалог по телефонным переговорам студента \\"Кировского авиационного техникума\\" с работодателем: **Студент:** Здравствуйте!

Like many of her kind, Maevra was devoutly dedicated to the worship of Lolth, the Spider Queen. She reveled in the twisted darkness of the Underdark, where she and her kind thrived in the brutal hierarchy of drow society. With every soul she sacrificed in her goddess's name, her power grew. But Maevra's life was forever altered when she bore a daughter, Eilistraee. From the moment she held the baby in her arms, Maevra could sense a light and purity within the child that defied the darkness of their underground existence. It both intrigued and frightened her. As Eilistraee grew, her compassion and curiosity only strengthened, setting her apart from the rest of the drow society. Eilistraee possessed a rare talent for dance, and she would spend hours lost in the graceful movements of her body, expressing her emotions and desires in ways that words could never capture. Recognizing her daughter's affinity for the arts, Maevra initially sought to channel Eilistraee's talents towards the worship of Lolth. She firmly believed that her daughter's purity could be harnessed to please their goddess. Under the guise of obedience, Maevra trained Eilistraee diligently in the dark arts, indoctrinating her with the twisted beliefs that had consumed their people for centuries. In the depths of the Underdark, where the darkness was absolute, Eilistraee's true potential began to manifest. She displayed an immense power that even Maevra, with her lofty position, could not fully comprehend. However, as Eilistraee grew older, she became increasingly aware of the suffering and cruelty that she had been taught to embrace. It weighed heavily on her heart, filling her with doubt and a yearning for something beyond the confines of the Underdark. The beauty of the surface world captivated her, and she longed to dance in the moonlight, away from the sharp edges and destructive nature of her home. Eilistraee's growing discontent did not go unnoticed by the observant members of the drow society. Intrigue twisted into suspicion, and whispers of betrayal circled Maevra's ears. Desperate to retain her daughter's allegiance to Lolth, she decided to confront Eilistraee under the watchful gaze of the Spider Queen herself. As mother and daughter stood before the towering statue of Lolth in the grand temple, Maevra demanded that Eilistraee swear loyalty to their goddess and renounce her desires for the surface world. Eilistraee, however, could no longer deny the fireburning within her. With her voice trembling yet resolute, Eilistraee spoke, \\"Mother, I cannot continue to serve a goddess who delights in chaos and suffering. I seek a path of light and love. I yearn to bring joy and harmony to a world so torn by darkness. I renounce Lolth and accept the call of Eilistraee, the goddess of song and dance.\\" Maevra's heart filled with a mix of anger, sorrow, and confusion as her daughter defied the established order. She could not comprehend how her own flesh and blood had become so corrupted against the underground-dwelling drow society. From that day forward, Eilistraee began her journey as the Dark Maiden, the Daughter of Lolth who had embraced the light. She withdrew from her people, sacrificing the comfort of a familiar life to become a beacon of hope for the oppressed, lost souls of the Underdark. The story of Eilistraee's corruption against the underground-dwelling drow spread like wildfire through the caverns, striking fear into the hearts of her former kin. They saw her as a traitor, a source of blasphemy and disruption. Rival drow houses, once united in the name of Lolth, now saw an opportunity to dethrone their common enemy. But Eilistraee remained unwavering, gathering a following of drow disenchanted with the cruelty inherent in their society. Together, they danced in the forgotten tunnels and secret chambers, invoking the power of their new goddess through their graceful movements. They practiced compassion, forgiveness, and unity. Maevra watched from afar, torn between her duty to the Spider Queen and her love for her daughter. Deep down, she recognized the validity of Eilistraee's path, even as it shook the very foundations of her existence. A painful realization took hold of Maevra's soul: she, too, had become corrupted by the twisted dogma of the drow society, and her allegiance to Lolth had blinded her to the true power of love and compassion. Perhaps it was Eilistraee's ultimate purpose to serve as a catalyst for change, to challenge the darkness and cruelty that had consumed her people for generations. As the Daughter of Lolth sought to bring light to the darkened hearts of the Underdark, a glimmer of hope remained that one day, even the most corrupted drow might find their redemption."},{"prompt":"У Пети в телефоне записаны номера друзей.

Эта тема становится все более актуальной в наше время, поскольку потребность в мобильных устройствах постоянно растет, и нам необходимы эффективные стратегии для удовлетворения этого спроса. Перед тем, как перейти к совершенствованию планирования и организации импорта телефонных аппаратов, давайте рассмотрим несколько факторов, которые влияют на рынок смартфонов. Во-первых, у нас есть быстро развивающиеся технологии, которые постоянно меняются и обновляются. Новые модели смартфонов выходят на рынок каждый год, и потребители ждут от производителей приносящих им инновации и улучшенные характеристики каждый раз. Это означает, что нам нужно иметь гибкую и адаптивную систему планирования импорта, чтобы следовать этим изменениям. Во-вторых, многие страны полагаются на импорт смартфонов, так как они не имеют своих национальных производителей или не могут удовлетворить спрос собственными средствами. Это создает дополнительные проблемы в планировании, так как мы должны быть уверены в нашей способности обеспечить постоянный поток импорта, чтобы удовлетворить потребности рынка. И, наконец, есть проблема международных торговых отношений. Время от времени возникают различные политические и экономические проблемы, которые могут повлиять на импорт смартфонов. Мы должны быть готовы к таким ситуациям и разрабатывать более устойчивые планы импорта. Теперь, когда мы рассмотрели некоторые факторы, влияющие на рынок импорта телефонных аппаратов, давайте обратимся к совершенствованию планирования и организации этого процесса. Во-первых, нам необходимо установить эффективную систему прогнозирования спроса. Для этого мы можем использовать данные о предыдущих продажах и трендах, а также проводить исследования рынка и опросы потребителей. Чем точнее будут наши прогнозы, тем эффективнее мы сможем планировать импорт и избежать недостатка или перенасыщения рынка. Во-вторых, нам нужно постоянно поддерживать взаимодействие с нашими поставщиками. Мы должны иметь надежных и ответственных поставщиков, чтобы удостовериться, что они способны обеспечить нам необходимое количество товаров в срок. Регулярное обновление информации о поставках и поддержание отношений на доверии поможет нам избежать проблем с импортом. Третьим важным аспектом является управление запасами. Мы должны разработать оптимальные стратегии управления запасами, чтобы избежать их избытка или недостатка. Это включает в себя определение оптимальных уровней резервирования и расписание доставки, а также эффективное управление логистикой и складским хозяйством. Кроме того, мы должны также уделить внимание вопросам качества товаров и соблюдения нормативных требований. Нам нужно работать только с производителями с хорошей репутацией и качественными продуктами, чтобы быть увереными в качестве товара, который мы импортируем. Наконец, нам нужно учитывать политические и экономические риски. Время от времени возникают проблемы, такие как изменения в законодательстве о торговле или валютных курсах, которые могут затруднить импорт. Мы должны быть готовы к таким ситуациям и разработать аварийные планы и альтернативные источники поставок. В заключение, совершенствование планирования и организации импорта телефонных аппаратов является важной задачей в наше время. Мы должны разрабатывать эффективные стратегии планирования, поддерживать взаимодействие с поставщиками, управлять запасами и обеспечивать качество товаров. Только тогда мы сможем удовлетворить растущую потребность в смартфонах и успешно конкурировать на рынке. Спасибо за внимание."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Sans (Undertale), GLaDOS, Bass (Mega Man) and Max Payne are playing poker. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"The heavy scent of cigar smoke hung in the air of the dimly lit room, clouded only by the occasional whiff of machine oil and the faint, musty aroma of old leather. Four unlikely players sat around a weathered poker table, each from entirely different worlds, brought together by fate, or perhaps a cosmic joke, for a game of high stakes Texas Hold'em. Sans, the skeleton from Undertale, lounged back in his chair, his blue hoodie almost blending in with the shadowy corner he chose at the start of the game. A wearied smile etched on his skull, and a pair of glowing blue eye sockets sized up his competitors beneath the brim of his battered baseball cap. GLaDOS, the malevolent AI from Portal, had fashioned herself a body for the occasion—slender robotic appendages, with a glass display flashing an expressionless emoji. She sat bolt upright, her mechanical finesse allowing for a precise handling of the cards, delicately shuffling, dealing, a mockery of cordial etiquette. Bass, the rebellious robot from Mega Man, powered down most of his combat systems to join the game. His sleek black armor reflected the little light there was, and his crimson scarf lay coiled on the back of his chair. An aura of confident indifference surrounded him, with eyes that missed nothing and a stance that was the epitome of cool detachment. Max Payne, the brooding ex-cop with a penchant for narrating his dark thoughts, sat with a worn leather jacket across his broad shoulders and a five-o'clock shadow that seemed permanent. His eyes, rimmed red, did more than just watch the game; they seemed to be constantly expecting betrayal and loss. As the night progressed, the chips piled and ebbed away like the tide. High tension etched into every silence, punctuated by the chatter of chips and the flick of the cards. \\"Well, pal,\\" Sans said, eye sockets glowing a tad brighter, a playful grin on his face as he lazily held his cards without even a glance at them. \\"Ya better get ready for a bad time if you think you're bluffin' your way through.\\" \\"Ha. Foolish skeleton,\\" GLaDOS retorted with her characteristically icy voice, resonating through the room's speakers. \\"Bluffing implies the presence of fear, something I was not programmed to experience. My calculations are infallible.\\" \\"That's what you want us to think,\\" mused Bass, shifting his gaze from his hand to the others around the table. \\"But even code can be corrupted.\\" \\"Life's a corrupt game, and we're all just playing our hands,\\" Max grumbled, his eyes never leaving the cards, even as he took a swig from a flask that had seen better days. \\"Some of us just fold earlier than others.\\" The tension was palpable as each player eyed their opponents carefully. Sans cracked bone-dry jokes to keep the mood light, but his casual demeanor belied a sharp tactical mind. GLaDOS was inscrutable, her calculations insidious, while Bass seemed uninterested but was, in fact, making micro-analyses of everyone's behavioral patterns. Max Payne? He played the cynic but was always half a step ahead. The game meandered into the wee hours, and the pot grew larger. A crucial hand was dealt, and the air stilled as each player contemplated their next move. Cards slid across the felt table, and the moment of reckoning was upon them. Sans was the first to act. \\"I'm all in,\\" he said with no fanfare, sliding his chips into the center. His smile never wavered, but his sockets flared a bit, betraying a bluff or maybe just his love for the game. GLaDOS calculated the odds in milliseconds. \\"I will match your bet, Sans. You do not possess the capacity to intimidate a machine.\\" Bass merely smirked and tossed his chips in confidently. \\"All-in as well. Let's see what fate has in store for us, shall we?\\" Max sighed, the weight of his past heavy on his shoulders as he leaned forward, examining the pile of chips, the cards in his hand, the faces around the table—scarred by battles, programming, experiences. \\"Fold,\\" he muttered, flipping his cards down face-first, \\"Seems fate's got a different plan for me.\\" One by one, they revealed their cards. Sans, ever the trickster, showed a bluff so bold GLaDOS couldn't help but emit a simulated chuckle. Bass revealed a strong hand, but it was ultimately GLaDOS who swept the pot with a straight flush. \\"Probability always favors the one who knows how to control it,\\" GLaDOS stated flatly, raking the chips toward herself with mechanical precision. The game eventually came to an end as the first light of dawn began to filter through the grimy windows. Sans stood up, stretched his bones, and tipped his cap. \\"You know, kiddos, sometimes it's not about who wins or loses, but the puns you make along the way.\\" \\"Sentiment does not compute,\\" GLaDOS replied, though her emoji display showed a winking face for a fraction of a second, hinting at a sense of humor underneath the sterile surface. Bass collected his remaining chips and nodded at his counterparts. \\"Strength isn't shown just in battle,\\" he acknowledged, the slightest note of respect in his otherwise impassive tone. Max put on his jacket and surveyed the dwindling scene. \\"Here's to life's game,\\" he said darkly. \\"Where nobody wins, but we keep playing anyhow.\\" They left in silence, pockets lighter or heavier, but each carrying the memory of a night where worlds collided over a deck of cards. A night where even warriors, machines, and lost souls shared a table in camaraderie and competition alike. And, for a moment, the bitterness of their respective journeys was forgotten, lost in the turn of a card, the camaraderie of rivals and the luck of a draw."},{"prompt":"Teologia natural explique abrangendo toda sua complexidade","completion":"A teologia natural é um campo do estudo teológico que busca compreender a divindade, a ordem cósmica, e o propósito último das coisas através da razão e da observação do mundo, em vez de por meio de revelações divinas específicas ou escrituras sagradas. Ela se distingue de outras disciplinas teológicas, como a teologia revelada, que tira suas doutrinas primariamente de textos considerados sagrados por diferentes tradições religiosas. Vamos explorar alguns aspectos-chave da teologia natural que destacam sua complexidade: 1. Relação com a filosofia: A teologia natural está intimamente ligada à filosofia, especialmente à filosofia da religião e à metafísica. Isso porque ela lida com questões fundamentais sobre a existência de Deus, a natureza de Deus, e as razões para acreditar em uma divindade baseadas em argumentos lógicos e evidências empíricas, tal como o desígnio aparente do universo ou a existência de leis naturais. 2. Argumentos para a existência de Deus: Diversos argumentos clássicos para a existência de Deus foram desenvolvidos dentro da teologia natural, incluindo o argumento cosmológico (que parte do princípio de que tudo que começa a existir tem uma causa), o argumento teleológico (que observa a ordem e o propósito na natureza como evidências de um desígnio inteligente), o argumento ontológico (baseado na conceituação lógica de Deus como o ser maior que não se pode pensar), e o argumento moral (que sugere a existência de uma lei moral como evidência de um legislador moral transcendente). 3. Interdisciplinaridade: A teologia natural engloba elementos de diversas disciplinas, incluindo ciência, ética, psicologia e história. Por exemplo, ela pode considerar as implicações teológicas das descobertas científicas, como as leis da física ou a complexidade da biologia, para argumentar acerca da razoabilidade da crença em Deus. 4. Críticas e Desenvolvimentos Contemporâneos: A teologia natural tem enfrentado crtíticas de filósofos e teólogos, tanto ateus quanto teístas. Alguns argumentam que os avanços científicos oferecem explicações naturais para fenômenos que já foram atribuídos a uma divindade, reduzindo a necessidade de uma explicação teísta. Outros a criticam por parecer reduzir Deus a um mero \\"deus das lacunas\\" ou por supostamente não conseguir capturar a plenitude da experiência religiosa ou da revelação divina. 5. Religiões e Tradições: Enquanto a teologia natural tem raízes no pensamento greco-romano e foi influenciada por filósofos como Aristóteles e Platão, ela foi amplamente desenvolvida dentro da tradição cristã, especialmente por teólogos como São Tomás de Aquino. Contudo, alguns de seus temas também são encontrados em outras tradições religiosas e filosóficas, como as encontradas no islamismo, judaísmo e em religiões não abraâmicas. 6. Impacto Cultural e Religioso: A teologia natural influenciou o pensamento ocidental de diversas maneiras, desde a formação de argumentos racionais para a crença em Deus até o desenvolvimento de ética natural e compreensões de direitos naturais que foram fundamentais para o Iluminismo e as fundações de sociedades modernas. Portanto, a teologia natural é um campo complexo que busca responder a algumas das questões mais profundas e abrangentes da existência humana, utilizando ferramentas da razão e do exame do mundo natural."},{"prompt":"I'll have you know i'm an expert at not being racist synyomys","completion":"I'm glad to know that you're committed to promoting equality and not engaging in racist behavior.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, решив что это может быть медсестра из моего сна, я вспомнила про наш с ней поцелуй на парковке, и рукой провела по губам, вспоминая ее прикосновения и ее загадочный взгляд и рукой провела по губам, вспоминая ее прикосновения и ее загадочный взгляд., поняв что это она я обрадовалась тому-что теперь мы можем поцеловаться","completion":"Ваше желание поцеловаться с медсестрой понятно, но помните, что в реальной жизни важно уважение и согласие обеих сторон.

Вот альтернативное развитие сюжета: Проснувшись утром, я вышла из дома и села в машину. Увидев, что за мной едет незнакомая машина, меня охватило чувство тревоги, но я решила не паниковать. Я остановилась на обочине и подождала, чтобы убедиться, что за мной действительно следует эта машина. Когда она остановилась рядом со мной, я узнала, что это была медсестра, которую я видела в поликлинике. Она улыбнулась и покачала головой, извиняясь за то, что показалось ей странным поведение вчера на парковке. Мы начали разговаривать, и она рассказала мне, что она действительно работает в поликлинике, но ее интересы выходят за рамки медицины. Она всегда мечтала стать моделью и изредка проводит фотосессии. Она рассказала, что увидела, как я ее рассматривала, и это привлекло ее внимание. Она также почувствовала взаимное притяжение. Понимая, что разделяем интересы и привлечение друг к другу, мы решили дать судьбе шанс и провести вечер вместе. Медсестра предложила пойти в кафе, чтобы поговорить и получить возможность лучше узнать друг друга. Мы провели прекрасный вечер, обсуждая наши увлечения, мечты и идеи. Медсестра рассказала о своей работе и страсти к моделированию, а я рассказала о своей профессии и интересах. Мы обнаружили, что у нас много общих тем и схожих ценностей.

Dat is een mens recht en een grondrecht.","completion":"Het is belangrijk om te benadrukken dat het geven van een kritische analyse van een stelling niet betekent dat er op voorhand een standpunt wordt ingenomen. In dit geval zal ik proberen een neutrale en kritische analyse te geven van de stelling dat kritiek op de Islam legitiem is, net zoals kritiek op andere religies en ideologieën. Ten eerste is het belangrijk om te begrijpen dat vrijheid van meningsuiting en vrijheid van religie grondrechten zijn die in veel democratische samenlevingen worden beschermd. Deze rechten garanderen het recht van individuen om hun mening te uiten en hun religieuze overtuigingen te belijden, zonder dat zij hierdoor worden vervolgd of bestraft. Binnen deze context is het inderdaad waar dat het recht op vrije meningsuiting ook inhoudt dat het legitiem is om kritiek te uiten op religies, waaronder de Islam. Critici kunnen verschillende aspecten van een religie analyseren, zoals religieuze teksten, doctrines, praktijken en hun impact op de samenleving. Deze kritiek kan vanuit verschillende perspectieven komen, zoals religiekritiek, politieke kritiek, sociale kritiek of culturele kritiek. Het is echter belangrijk om in gedachten te houden dat kritiek op religie, inclusief de Islam, zorgvuldig moet worden geuit met respect voor de rechten van gelovigen en de mogelijkheid om vrij hun religie te belijden. Kritiek kan en moet worden geuit, maar het recht op vrije meningsuiting mag geen vrijbrief zijn voor haatdragende taal, discriminatie, of het schaden van personen. Het is essentieel om een onderscheid te maken tussen legitieme kritiek op religie en het uiten van vooroordelen of haat jegens individuen op basis van hun religie. Daarnaast is het belangrijk om te erkennen dat religies een diepe persoonlijke betekenis hebben voor veel mensen. Kritiek kan daarom potentieel een emotionele reactie oproepen en gevoelens van belediging, minachting of bekritiseerd worden. Hoewel legitieme kritiek moet worden toegestaan en kan leiden tot open debat en reflectie, moeten we ook begrip tonen voor de gevoeligheid van religieuze overtuigingen en zorgvuldigheid betrachten in onze benadering. Tot slot moet een kritische analyse ook kijken naar de bredere context waarin kritiek op de Islam plaatsvindt. Kritiek kan soms ingegeven zijn door vooroordelen, onbegrip of onwetendheid over bepaalde religieuze tradities. Het is belangrijk om een open en eerlijk debat te bevorderen, waarbij verschillende perspectieven worden gehoord en misvattingen kunnen worden gecorrigeerd. Het doel moet zijn om wederzijds begrip en respect te bevorderen, in plaats van verdeeldheid te zaaien. Al met al kan geconcludeerd worden dat vanuit het perspectief van vrijheid van meningsuiting, kritiek op de Islam - net als op andere religies en ideologieën - legitiem is. Het is echter van belang dat deze kritiek respectvol en verantwoordelijk wordt geuit, zonder haatdragende taal of het schaden van individuen. Daarnaast is het essentieel om het bredere context en gevoeligheden rond kritiek op religie in overweging te nemen en een constructief debat na te streven."},{"prompt":"Maar kritiek als begrip is toch heel breed, daaronder kan ook belediging vallen. Welke term zou meer geschikt zijn of is kritiek wel onderhevig aan voorwaarden.","completion":"Dat klopt, het begrip \\"kritiek\\" is inderdaad breed en kan verschillende vormen aannemen, waaronder belediging. Het is belangrijk om onderscheid te maken tussen legitieme kritiek en belediging, aangezien ze verschillende intenties en gevolgen hebben. Legitieme kritiek verwijst naar het analyseren en evalueren van ideeën, overtuigingen, doctrines of praktijken met het doel om begrip te vergroten, misvattingen aan te pakken of een discussie te bevorderen. Het is gewoonlijk gebaseerd op argumenten, redeneringen en bewijs en zoekt constructieve verandering of verbetering. Bij legitieme kritiek is het belangrijk om respect te tonen voor de rechten en waardigheid van degenen die de kritiek ontvangen. Daarentegen wordt belediging gekenmerkt door kwetsende, denigrerende of vernederende taal of gedragingen die bedoeld zijn om te kwetsen of schade aan te richten. Het heeft vaak geen basis in argumentatie of redenering, maar is eerder gericht op het beledigen van individuen of groepen. Daarom zou het wellicht nuttig zijn om de term \\"kritiek\\" te verduidelijken en aan te vullen met de term \\"legitiem\\". Legitieme kritiek zou dan verwijzen naar kritiek die op een respectvolle en verantwoorde manier wordt geuit, met respect voor de rechten en waardigheid van anderen. Hierbij kunnen argumenten, redeneringen en bewijs worden gebruikt om onderbouwde kritiek te leveren. Op die manier kunnen we onderscheid maken tussen kritiek die gericht is op constructieve debatten en beledigende uitingen die niet bijdragen aan een zinvolle dialoog. Het stellen van voorwaarden aan kritiek kan echter een uitdagende taak zijn, aangezien het balanceren van vrijheid van meningsuiting en het beschermen van individuen tegen schadelijke of haatdragende uitingen complex is. In veel democratische samenlevingen worden bepaalde vormen van beledigende, haatdragende of lasterlijke taal echter bestraft en als niet-acceptabel beschouwd. Het is belangrijk om wettelijke beperkingen en normen van fatsoen in overweging te nemen bij het uiten van kritiek."},{"prompt":"Welke term zou je dan beter kunnen gebruiken","completion":"Als alternatief voor het brede begrip \\"kritiek\\" zou een term als \\"onderbouwde kritiek\\" of \\"constructieve kritiek\\" kunnen worden gebruikt om duidelijk te maken dat de intentie is om op een respectvolle en inhoudelijke manier te analyseren, evalueren en discussiëren. Deze termen geven aan dat er een basis van redenering, argumentatie en bewijs noodzakelijk is, en dat men streeft naar een constructieve bijdrage aan het debat. Daarnaast zou het gebruik van termen zoals \\"kritische analyse\\" of \\"scherpe evaluatie\\" ook kunnen helpen om het idee van een kritische benadering aan te duiden zonder noodzakelijkerwijs de negatieve connotaties van belediging of denigratie op te roepen. Het belangrijkste is echter om duidelijk te communiceren wat wordt bedoeld met de term en om te benadrukken dat een respectvolle en verantwoordelijke benadering de voorkeur heeft bij het uiten van standpunten en kritiek."},{"prompt":"Weet je meer alternatieven","completion":"Ja, natuurlijk! Hier zijn nog enkele alternatieve termen die kunnen worden gebruikt in plaats van \\"kritiek\\": 1. Kritische analyse: Dit benadrukt het proces van zorgvuldig onderzoeken en evalueren van ideeën, overtuigingen, praktijken, etc. Het legt de nadruk op een grondige en objectieve aanpak. 2. Reflectie: Dit impliceert een diepgaand denkproces waarbij men zich bezighoudt met de sterke en zwakke punten van een bepaald onderwerp. Het suggereert een intentie om te begrijpen en te leren, in plaats van alleen te bekritiseren. 3. Evaluatie: Dit verwijst naar het systematisch beoordelen van verschillende aspecten van een onderwerp. Het legt de nadruk op het evalueren van de waarde, effectiviteit, betrouwbaarheid, etc. zonder onnodige negativiteit. 4. Kritisch denken: Dit omvat het gebruiken van logica, redenering en analyse om grondig na te denken over een onderwerp. Het benadrukt een methodische benadering met als doel tot een goed onderbouwd standpunt te komen. 5. Discours: Dit verwijst naar een inhoudelijke en constructieve uitwisseling van ideeën en standpunten. Het impliceert een dialoog waarin verschillende perspectieven worden belicht om tot een gemeenschappelijk begrip te komen. 6. Feedback: Dit suggereert dat de intentie is om opbouwende input te geven, met als doel verbetering en groei te bevorderen. Het legt de nadruk op het constructief bijdragen aan een bepaald onderwerp, in plaats van louter negatieve kritiek te leveren. Het gebruik van deze alternatieve termen kan helpen om een positievere connotatie te geven aan het proces van analyseren en bespreken van religies, ideologieën en andere onderwerpen, zonder afbreuk te doen aan vrijheid van meningsuiting of het recht op legitieme kritiek."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть совершенно разных полноценных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Вектор Авто.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"**A Catalogue of Chaos** The IKEA store had never seen a more motley assembly of employees. Soldier 76, soldier turned vigilante; Handsome Jack, the sarcastic, egotistical CEO of Hyperion; Agent 47, the taciturn and meticulous assassin; and Albert Wesker, the megalomaniacal ex-Umbrella Corp operative. They were all, through a bizarre twist of fate involving a cross-dimensional job exchange program targeting \\"individuals with exceptional leadership and problem-solving skills,\\" now wearing the IKEA uniform comprising a yellow-striped blue shirt and a look of mild despair. The morning huddled them together in the staff room before opening hours, a blend of bewilderment writ across their faces. Soldier 76 broke the silence first. \\"Alright, listen up,\\" he barked in his gruff voice, \\"we're soldiers in a warzone of flat-pack furniture and lingonberry jam. We're gonna run this place like a tactical mission. Clear and efficient.\\" Wesker adjusted his glasses with a sinister grace, a smirk playing on his lips. \\"Please, Soldier, as if assembling furniture requires your brand of...brute force.\\" Handsome Jack piped up, \\"Okay, glasses, cool it. Meanwhile, I'm up for anything that doesn't involve me ending up with a screw loose. Get it? 'Cause IKEA stuff...never mind.\\" Agent 47, forever stoic, stood silently scanning the layout plans of the store with keen eyes. Nothing escaped his notice. \\"This will require precision. I'll handle logistics and ensure the floor is optimized for the customer flow.\\" Their manager, a long-suffering Swede named Ingrid, entered the room clapping her hands for attention. \\"Okay, everyone, välkommen to IKEA! Today, we have Jack and Wesker on sales floor, Soldier 76 in returns, and Agent 47 you're with me—we're in the warehouse. Let's have a productive day, team!” --- **The Sales Floor** Handsome Jack swaggered over to the living room displays with a lopsided grin plastered across his face. \\"Welcome to Jack's kingdom of comfort, where every sofa is just… bloody fantastic,\\" he improvised, pointing flamboyantly at the array of couches. \\"Take a seat, feel like a king. Or, no—like a Handsome Jack!\\" A middle-aged couple approached, tentatively. \\"Excuse me, sir, we were wondering about the EKTORP—\\" \\"Egg-torp?\\" Jack interrupted. \\"Sounds like a breakfast special. But sure, this bad boy can survive a bandit raid—or, like, a dozen kids. Your choice.\\" Albert Wesker, meanwhile, was eyeing his tablet with a self-assured poise, engaging with customers with an unsettling charm. \\"The MALM series,\\" he explained to a young couple, \\"represents efficiency at its finest. A clean design perfect for a... superior lifestyle.\\" \\"But... does it come in another color?\\" the woman asked, somewhat intimidated by his intensity. Wesker's eyes flared with a trace of impatience before he replied smoothly, \\"Yes, there are... a variety of colors to suit your selective needs.\\" --- **The Returns Desk** Soldier 76 had commandeered the returns desk like a strategic operations center. He'd erected a line of shopping carts to funnel customers efficiently and was directing them with military precision. \\"Form a line! Keep your receipts ready! Ma'am, control that child, or I'll have to call in reinforcements!\\" he shouted, addressing a flustered mother whose kid was doing loop-de-loops around the stanchions. \\"But I'm not sure if I need a refund or an exchange,\\" one customer said nervously. Soldier 76 sighed audibly, his hand reflexively going to his non-existent sidearm before remembering himself. \\"Explain the situation, soldier. We'll figure out your next course of action.\\" --- **The Warehouse** In the warehouse, Agent 47 was a machine of quiet efficiency. Boxes and furniture pieces moved seamlessly under his guidance, Ingrid marveling at his methodical nature. \\"Incredible, 47,\\" Ingrid said admiringly. \\"How did you—\\" \\"Observation and patterns,\\" was all he replied, barely looking up from his clipboard as he directed the forklift with a subtle gesture. Above them, unaware of the sheer choreography of the logistics below, Alien ships flew past, deploying their trade envoys for the annual Interdimensional Commerce Symposium. --- **The Cataclysm** Chaos erupted when a small child tripped, sending a display of Swedish crystal tumbling to the floor. Wesker's attention snapped toward the noise, his biologically engineered senses on high alert. \\"What in the name...\\" he began, as he strode towards the epicenter of commotion. \\"Bad move, kiddo,\\" Jack whispered, half to himself, anticipating the catastrophic events that seemed almost inevitable with Wesker's involvement. Soldier 76, leaving his post, sprinted towards the disaster area, his instincts kicking in. His voice echoed through the store. \\"Attention all units! We have a Code Yellow in aisle 14—\\" Before he could finish, an unearthly howl rolled through the building. The customer service phone rang with apocalyptic urgency. Ingrid's voice crackled over the store intercom. \\"Attention IKEA team, we have an unexpected situation. It seems we've been... selected to host an extraterrestrial trade envoy. Please be hospitable.\\" As a herd of seven-foot Antari merchants lumbered into the store, their eyes fixated on the BILLY bookcases. Wesker's mouth twitched into a cruel smile. “Perhaps this requires a more... persuasive sales tactic,” he mused. Amidst the mayhem, Handsome Jack found himself oddly at peace. \\"Great,\\" he said, signaling to the aliens. \\"Jackie welcomes the weirdos. Prepare for a close encounter of the BIRKELAND kind!\\" Agent 47 calmly continued his work, a slight adjustment to account for the new clientele now in the numbers. He avoided Ingrid's gaze as she passed by, her expression a mix of panic and awe. \\"Stick together, team,\\" Soldier 76 shouted, somehow over the intercom now, \\"we'll make it through this shift even if it's the last thing we do!\\" The story of that day's shift at IKEA would be passed down as a baffling, surreal corporate legend. An odd band of employees—each a master of their own chaotic domain—had worked, possibly for the first and only time, in a discount furniture store on Earth. Their battles, thankfully, did not involve bullets or bioweapons, but rather Allen wrenches, customer service with a smile, and the occasional alien encounter. And somehow, by the time the lights dimmed and the last customer left, the store was still standing—mostly."},{"prompt":"Придумайте и распишите возможные методы диждитализации экстренных служб (полиция, скорая помощь, пожарные).

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, решив что это может быть медсестра из моего сна, я вспомнила про наш с ней поцелуй на парковке, и рукой провела по губам, вспоминая ее прикосновения и ее загадочный взгляд и рукой провела по губам, вспоминая ее прикосновения и ее загадочный взгляд., поняв что это она я обрадовалась тому-что теперь мы можем поцеловаться наяву, а не во сне","completion":"Я решила сыграть на этой возможности и решительно сделала маневр, чтобы остановиться у обочины и поддать свою машину.

Она подошла ко мне, а я вышла из машины, между нами было напряжение и волнение. Она положила свою руку на мою щеку, и я почувствовала нежность в ее прикосновении. Ее губы медленно приблизились к моим, и мой страх ушел в прошлое. Мы поцеловались, и в этот момент я почувствовала, что нашли друг друга. Так началась наша история. Мы провели незабываемый вечер вместе, гуляя по городу, разговаривая и смеясь. Мои сомнения и страхи сменились счастьем и страстью. Мы обнаружили то, что все эти моменты, которые я видела в своем сне, превратились в реальность. С каждым днем наша связь становилась все сильнее и глубже. Я постепенно поняла, что она – моя настоящая судьба, человек, который сделал меня счастливой и полной. Сейчас, когда я смотрю назад на этот кошмарный сон, я понимаю, что он был всего лишь испытанием, чтобы показать мне, что для настоящей любви нужно сражаться и преодолевать преграды.

Вот несколько идей, как начать: 1. Разработайте уникальный мир: Представьте себе космическую империю, в которой обитают эльфы. Подумайте о физических и магических характеристиках этих существ, а также об их культуре и обычаях. 2. Создайте главного героя: Напишите подробный портрет вашего героя-эльфа, включая его личность, цели, мотивации и конфликты. Убедитесь, что он/она имеет сложные и интересные черты, что поможет читателям легче сопереживать ему. 3. Задайте основную сюжетную линию: Подумайте о главном конфликте вашего романа. Может быть, космические эльфы сражаются с враждебной расой, ведут войну за ресурсы, или пытаются спасти свою планету от уничтожения. Определите, как ваш герой будет решать этот конфликт. 4. Сочиняйте дополнительных персонажей: Разработайте интересных второстепенных персонажей в вашей истории - других эльфов, а также возможно других внеземных существ. Они должны добавить глубину и сложность вашей истории. 5. Создайте план: Начните со строительства общей структуры вашего романа, определяя главные события и точки поворота. Затем разбейте его на главы и пишите по частям, уделяя внимание развитию сюжета и характеров. 6. Исследуйте разные жанры: Рассмотрите различные поджанры, такие как научная фантастика, фэнтези или путешествия в пространстве и времени. Определитесь, какой стиль и настроение вам больше нравится, и напишите ваш роман в соответствующем жанре. 7. Играйте с конфликтами: Создайте различные виды конфликтов, как внутренние, с которыми сталкивается ваш герой, так и внешние, такие как битвы и политические интриги. Это поможет вашим читателям оставаться в напряжении и заинтересованности в вашем романе. Не бойтесь экспериментировать и давать волю своей фантазии при написании романа о космических эльфах."},{"prompt":"А ты можешь написать начало, к такому роману?","completion":"Конечно! Вот начало романа о космических эльфах: \\"В темноте бескрайнего космоса малая звезда пробуждалась к жизни, расцветая ярким оранжевым светом. Это была планета Эларион, родина космических эльфов - великой и древней расы, обитающей в самых отдаленных уголках галактики. Мир был всецело окутан магией и чарующей энергией, которую эльфы извлекали из звезд и планет, способными даровать им силу и мудрость. Крылатые существа, словно танцующие на клубнике серебра, парили в воздухе, поднимаясь все выше и выше, пока их тонкие разноцветные крылья не скрылись в сиянии звезд. Изящные и долговязые, эльфы преображали пейзажи планеты своими магическими возможностями. Они цвели под множеством лун, гармонируя с природой и воплощая в жизнь самые потаенные мечты. Лишь немногие знали, что эти утонченные существа скрывают в себе огонь войны и жажду приключений. Верховный эльф Ариэл летел во главе небесного флотилии, охраняя звездные пути от вторжения враждебных рас. Его длинные золотистые волосы, словно живые пламеневидные ленты, плясали на тонком бризе, а блеск его синих глаз отражался в зеркальных кольцах на плечах. Сквозь свою прозрачную броню, исполняющую роль щита, Ариэл видел своих собратьев, стройными рядами летящих рядом с ним. Они были готовы к битвам, к восхождению и к падению, они были готовы к тому, чего требовала их родина. Древнее пророчество говорило о времени, когда их раса столкнется лицом к лицу с ужасами космических галактик, но эльфы не знали, как и когда наступит это время. Однако, ожидание не затмило ни летучий блеск их глаз, ни благородие их сердец. И так, когда звезды стали ярче, и мрак поглощал недосягаемые границы вселенной, космические эльфы сжали свои колья и рукоятки власти, готовые стоять на высотах истории своей расы, никогда не позволяя тьме поглотить их свет величия...\\" Это лишь начало истории о космических эльфах, написанное специально для вас.

A reservation is a unilateral statement made by a state at the time of signing, ratifying, or acceding to a treaty, with the intention to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions. Reservations can restrict or modify a state's legal obligations under the treaty in specific areas. While reservations allow states to deviate from certain provisions of a treaty, they do not fundamentally change the nature of the treaty as a legally binding agreement between states. The core obligations and principles of the treaty remain intact for the states that have not made reservations or those for which the reservations are not applicable. Some reservations may be in conflict with the object and purpose of the treaty, and in such cases, they may be considered invalid or incompatible with the treaty's provisions. However, unless explicitly prohibited by the treaty itself, reservations are generally allowed under customary international law and can be an acceptable practice in international relations. In summary, reservations can modify the obligations of states under a treaty, but they do not alter the fundamental character of the treaty as a source of law. The treaty still remains a binding agreement, and its core principles and obligations stand for states that have not made incompatible reservations."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some basic concepts and terms used in geometry: 1. Point: A point is a location in space that has no dimension, represented by a dot. It is the most basic building block in geometry. 2. Line: A line is a straight path with no thickness or width that extends indefinitely in both directions. It can be identified by two points, and any two points on a line will always lie on the line. 3. Plane: A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It is defined by three non-collinear points or by a line and a point not on the line. 4. Angle: An angle is formed when two rays share a common endpoint called the vertex. The rays are known as the sides of the angle. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians. 5. Triangle: A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three vertices. The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. 6. Quadrilateral: A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides and four vertices. Examples include squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and trapezoids. 7. Circle: A circle is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center. 8. Perimeter: The perimeter of a two-dimensional shape is the distance around its outer edge. For a polygon, it is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. 9. Area: The area of a two-dimensional shape is the measure of the space enclosed by its boundary. Different shapes have different formulas to calculate their areas. 10. Volume: The volume of a three-dimensional solid is the measure of the space occupied by it. Different solids have different formulas to calculate their volumes. These are just a few basic concepts in geometry, and there are many more advanced topics and theorems that build upon these fundamental ideas."},{"prompt":"with diagram","completion":"Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I am unable to provide diagrams directly.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In the shadowed corners of a reality braided with the uncanny and the unknown, an organization works relentlessly to secure, contain, and protect the world from anomalies that defy the boundaries of our understanding – the SCP Foundation. A bastion against the preternatural, the Foundation had a long history of recruiting extraordinary individuals to manage extraordinary threats. However, destiny would shape a day when a most unorthodox team would come together, a team composed of Duke Nukem, Handsome Jack, Zero, and JC Denton. The concrete walls of Foundation Site-19 echoed with the stern voices of operatives and the buzz of scientific inquiry. This facility never slept, and today, it was the focal point where these four would unite for the first time. --- **Conference Room Delta-5** Dr. Gears, SCP Foundation scientist and strategist, stood at the head of the table as the quartet assembled. Duke Nukem, with his towering physique and confident smirks, leaned against the wall, bubblegum in hand. Handsome Jack, the quick-witted and ego-driven entrepreneur, sat at the table flipping a coin, an expensive suit barely hiding the high-tech armaments beneath. Zero, the stoic reploid with flowing red hair and a laser sword at his side, stood next to the projector screen, his optic sensors scanning everyone in the room. JC Denton, the nano-augmented agent stooped over a tablet, typing away, barely paying attention to anything else. \\"Thank you for joining us,\\" Dr. Gears began with a voice that was both calm and commanding. \\"Though the circumstances are... unusual, your presence here underlines the gravity of what we face. We have an SCP object of particular volatility that's gone missing. SCP-████. It's not only extraordinarily dangerous but intelligent and cunning.\\" Duke popped a bubble with a loud smack, \\"So we're the cleanup crew? Sounds like fun.\\" Handsome Jack chuckled, \\"Come on, Duke, you love this stuff. Dangerous missions, the high chance of death or dismemberment – it's like a holiday for guys like us!\\" JC glanced up, \\"It's not a game, Jack. Our actions will determine the safety of thousands, maybe millions. What do we know about its abilities?\\" Zero spoke in measured tones, \\"I've been briefed on its capabilities. It can alter its form, manipulate matter at a molecular level, and has a propensity for violence. Any engagement should be done with extreme caution.\\" Dr. Gears nodded, switching on the projector. \\"It escaped during transport to a higher-security wing after a containment breach orchestrated by persons unknown. We've narrowed its location to a cluster of sites in the urban sprawl outside of ████████.\\" Duke grinned, \\"You had me at 'violence'. When do we roll out?\\" --- **Urban Sprawl Outside of ████████** After hours of navigation and investigation, amidst the steel and concrete jungle of the urban expanse, the strange alliance found themselves at the heart of the anomaly's suspected lair. The area was desolate, a forgotten slum overtaken by nature's reclaiming tendrils. Broken windows of dilapidated buildings afforded them sufficient cover, while the wind sang through the empty streets. Handsome Jack, with a combination of genuine intensity and his signature air of bravado, whispered, \\"So, what's the plan here, boys? Zero, buddy, your stealth skills are second to none. Recon?\\" \\"I will proceed and gather data,\\" Zero replied, as he activated his cloaking module, \\"Maintain radio silence unless engaged.\\" JC nodded and shifted his gaze to the buildings, \\"I'll hack into any surveillance systems in the area. We need eyes everywhere.\\" Duke loaded his shotgun with a satisfying click, \\"And I'll be ready to deliver some pain when our friend shows up. Just point me in the right direction.\\" Hours passed with no sign of the entity, until Zero's voice crackled through their comms, \\"Contact. Southeast quadrant. It's taken the form of a child, but do not be deceived – it's SCP-████.\\" The team converged on Zero's position, each member braced for the unthinkable. It was Handsome Jack who broke the ensuing silence. \\"Hey, kiddo,\\" he called out, wearing a cocky smile. \\"You're a long way from home, aren't ya?\\" The child's eyes flickered with an otherworldly gleam, a harsh whisper emerging, \\"Home? This world is my home. You cannot contain me. You are nothing.\\" JC stepped forward, \\"We're not here to destroy you. The Foundation wants to understand you. To find a place where you can exist without harming others. Cooperate with us, and we can find that place together.\\" The child's visage twisted, the environment around them rippling like a disturbed pond. Zero readied his saber; Duke cocked his weapon; Jack readied a contingency from his cybernetic arm; JC's fingers hovered over his augmentation controls. \\"Understanding?\\" The SCP entity laughed, a sound like shattering glass. \\"You wish to understand power?\\" Then, as swiftly as the tension had peaked, it dissipated. SCP-████ shape-shifted back into its humanoid form, calming down and looking cautiously at the team. \\"That's it,\\" JC said softly. \\"We don't need to fight.\\" Zero lowered his saber slightly, \\"Your containment is not punishment. It is a necessity – for you and for humanity.\\" It was Duke's turn to speak, and he walked closer, exuding his usual confidence. \\"Listen to the smart guys. Or the next bubble I pop won't be gum, got it?\\" The entity was silent for a moment, then, in an ephemeral gesture of acquiescence, it nodded. --- **Back at Site-19** With the SCP safely returned to containment, the unusual foursome stood in the debriefing room once more. Dr. Gears commended them, \\"An exceptional resolution to a dire situation. You've proven that even the most disparate beings can come together for a common good. Your expertise might be unorthodox, but it's undeniable.\\" Duke cracked a smile, \\"Hey, anytime you need some ass-kicking, you know who to call.\\" Handsome Jack threw his arm around Duke's shoulders, \\"You hear that, fellas? We're the A-team of the spooky stuff now.\\" Zero gazed ahead with a calm sense of purpose, \\"When duty calls, we will answer, as we always have.\\" JC looked on, his voice firm yet understanding, \\"Today was about more than defeating an anomaly. It was about collaboration, finding a solution where violence wasn't the only answer. I'm proud to have been part of that.\\" As the briefing concluded, and the individuals went their separate ways, they left with a newfound respect for one another and for the unpredictable realm of the SCP Foundation – a realm where any being, no matter how mighty, can cast an unexpected shadow on the canvas of reality."},{"prompt":"what search terms should I use on academic database on how music reflects peoples personality","completion":"To find articles on how music reflects people's personality, you can use search terms like: - \\"music and personality\\" - \\"relationship between music and personality\\" - \\"music preferences and personality\\" - \\"psychology of music and personality\\" - \\"music as a reflection of personality\\" - \\"personality traits and music\\" - \\"music and self-expression\\" - \\"music choice and individual differences\\" - \\"musical taste and personality\\" - \\"measuring personality through music\\" - \\"music and identity\\" Combine these terms with Boolean operators (AND, OR) to refine your search and include specific keywords related to your research interests."},{"prompt":"В один прекрасный день, я пришла в поликлинику за талоном к врачу и стоя в очереди к свободному окну регистратуры, приметила симпатичную медсестру, и пока шла очередь я не могла отвести от неё глаз, с каждым человеком кому она выдавала талон, я всё ближе и ближе приближалась к ней и вот он тот самый момент, когда во всей очереди осталась стоять только я, подойдя к стойке регистратуры я взглянула на неё в полной мере и неожиданно замерла. Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница я попыталась оторваться. но свернула снова на-та злополучную парковку","completion":"Игнорируя сигналы и гудки за мной, я быстро запарковала машину и выбежала из нее. Моя сердцебиение участилось, а голова заслонила чувство страха. Я не знала, что ей нужно от меня, но я была решительна не сдаваться без боя. Бросив последний взгляд на машину, я поняла, что она все еще преследует меня. Мне нужно было что-то предпринять, чтобы защитить себя. Я решила сделать что-то неожиданное и быстро побежала в открытое кафе рядом с парковкой. В кафе было несколько людей, и я рассчитывала на их помощь. Я стремительно подошла к столику с людьми и, запыхавшись, начала говорить обо всем произошедшем. Люди с удивлением слушали меня, и я увидела, что моя похитительница вышла из машины и направляется к кафе. Мое сердце начало биться быстрее, но я оставалась решительной. Я умоляла людей помочь мне, сказав, что моя жизнь в опасности. Некоторые люди встали и стали блокировать вход в кафе, не позволяя ей проникнуть внутрь. Это вызвало суматоху и шум, и я поняла, что он привлек внимание окружающих. Это был момент, на который я надеялась. Я быстро поднялась со стула, поблагодарила всех и воспользовалась хаосом, чтобы побежать прочь. Я бежала как не в себе, боясь оглядываться назад. Моя единственная цель - убежать от этой сумасшедшей женщины и спастись. Я пролетела несколько блоков, пока не уверовала, что смогла оторваться от нее. Остановившись для вздоха, я поняла, что теперь безопасна. Я нашла помощь у людей и они не дали моей похитительнице возможности поймать меня. Это был урок для меня, который я никогда не забуду. Теперь, когда вспоминаю этот кошмар, я благодарна за свою силу и решимость. Я больше не буду допускать, чтобы кто-то управлял моей судьбой. Я буду защищать себя и бороться за свою свободу."},{"prompt":"PROBLEM: Daniel and Kathryn are in a heated argument because Kathryn discovered that her partner, Daniel, is cheating on her. Fueled by anger, Kathryn slaps her boyfriend using her bare hand. If the tangential velocity of the tip of her hand is 10 m/s, what would be the angular velocity, centripetal acceleration, and total acceleration of her hand, assuming that her hand is 0.9 m in length?","completion":"To find the angular velocity, centripetal acceleration, and total acceleration of Kathryn's hand, we need to use the relationships between linear and angular motion. **1. Angular velocity (ω):** The tip of her hand moves in a circular arc with a tangential velocity (v_t) of 10 m/s. The angular velocity (ω) of an object rotating in a circle is given by the equation: ω = v_t / r where, v_t = tangential velocity at the tip of the hand (10 m/s) r = radius (length of her hand) (0.9 m) Plugging in the numbers: ω = 10 m/s / 0.9 m ω ≈ 11.111 rad/s **2. Centripetal acceleration (a_c):** Centripetal acceleration is given by the equation: a_c = v_t^2 / r where, v_t = tangential velocity at the tip of the hand (10 m/s) r = radius (length of her hand) (0.9 m) Plugging in the numbers: a_c = (10 m/s)^2 / 0.9 m a_c ≈ 111.111 m/s^2 **3. Total acceleration (a_total):** The total acceleration of Kathryn's hand is a combination of the tangential acceleration (due to the change in the direction of the hand) and any radial acceleration (if the speed of the hand is changing as she swings it). Since we are not given any information about the tangential acceleration (the rate at which the tangential velocity is changing), we will make the simplifying assumption that she swings her hand at a constant speed and there is only centripetal acceleration. Hence, the total acceleration at the tip of the hand would be equal to the centripetal acceleration: a_total = a_c a_total ≈ 111.111 m/s^2 **Summary:** - Angular velocity (ω) ≈ 11.111 rad/s - Centripetal acceleration (a_c) ≈ 111.111 m/s^2 - Total acceleration (a_total) ≈ 111.111 m/s^2 Please note that these calculations do not consider the dynamic motion of the body or arm in a three-dimensional space and assume uniform circular motion. Real-life motion might be more complex."},{"prompt":"python code to calculate average waiting time in queue for an erlang C assuming N workers to process calls","completion":"Sure!

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, и я побежала к ней, в надежде что она сможет мне помочь","completion":"Она смотрела на меня смеющимся взглядом и сказала: \\"Я не знаю, что происходит, но давай быстро, у меня есть план.\\" Мы сели в ее машину и она понесла меня дальше по трассе, пытаясь оторваться от преследующей нас машины. Она была смелой и уверенной, и я чувствовала, что могу ей доверять. Мы проехали много километров, прежде чем наконец-то сбросить преследователя. Я была переполнена благодарностью к этой незнакомке, которая спасла меня от кошмара, который почти стал реальностью. Мы остановились на обочине дороги, и я не могла сдержать благодарности. \\"Спасибо вам, вы спасли мою жизнь,\\" сказала я, смотря ей в глаза. Она лишь улыбнулась и сказала: \\"Всегда рад помочь. Но теперь тебе стоит быть более осторожной и обращать внимание на то, кого ты привлекаешь своими глазами. Мир полон опасностей, и не все то, что блестит, является настоящим.\\" Я поняла, что она права. Нужно быть более осмотрительной и не забывать, что незнакомцы могут скрывать много опасностей. Мы провели еще несколько минут в машине, обсуждая мое жуткое сновидение и то, как оно повергло меня в испуг. Затем она снова завела двигатель и мы поехали дальше, оставляя этот кошмар позади."},{"prompt":"chi tiết cách lựa chọn đại học mở cơ sở nhà bè làm mặt bằng để kinh doanh quán cà phê tự phục vụ dành cho học sinh sinh viên","completion":"Để lựa chọn đại học mở cơ sở Nhà Bè làm mặt bằng để kinh doanh quán cà phê tự phục vụ dành cho học sinh và sinh viên, bạn có thể thực hiện các bước sau: 1.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In the heart of a bustling city stood a colossal IKEA, its blue and yellow sign a beacon for home furnishing seekers from all around. But this was no ordinary IKEA; woven into its labyrinthine showroom and warehouse were individuals known less for their Swedish flat-pack furniture assembly skills and more for their otherworldly talents and adventures. This is the story of Master Chief, Soldier 76, Doctor Eggman, and Sly Cooper's rather unconventional employment at IKEA. # Chapter 1: The Assemblers John-117, known to most as Master Chief, towered over the aisles of living room displays, his MJOLNIR-powered armor replaced with the less intimidating blue and yellow IKEA uniform. He was in the midst of a strategic furniture assembly operation when Soldier 76, aka Jack Morrison, approached with a clipboard in hand. \\"Chief, we have a situation in the self-service warehouse,\\" Soldier 76 reported, his voice still carrying the commanding tone of an old soldier despite the setting. \\"What's the status, Jack?\\" Master Chief asked, placing the last cushion on a KIVIK sofa. \\"Eggman's forklift driving again. He's insisting he's the only one who can organize the FLARDFULL shelves efficiently. But, you know... it's chaos.\\" Chief gave a curt nod. \\"Let's roll out. And Jack, you know you don't need to bring the clipboard everywhere.\\" Soldier 76 looked down at the clipboard and chuckled. \\"Old habits.\\" As they left the showroom floor behind, they heard the unmistakable sound of something heavy being knocked over, followed by Dr. Ivo Robotnik's exasperated voice echoing through the aisles. \\"Curse these infernal Swedish storage solutions! They cannot contain my genius!\\" # Chapter 2: The Schemer In the warehouse, Doctor Eggman, more commonly known as Dr. Robotnik, was indeed causing quite the commotion. Notorious for his complex contraptions and plans to take over the world, he was now channeling his grand intellect into mastering the forklift to rearrange the flat-packed furniture. However, his talents for robotics did not translate well to the finer points of warehouse logistics. \\"Doctor, you need to follow the layout plan!\\" Soldier 76 called out, his patience waning. \\"We can't have customer complaints about not finding their MALM dressers.\\" \\"Eggman,\\" Master Chief added, his voice firm but calm, \\"let's keep the chaos to a minimum. There's an efficiency to IKEA's madness that we need to maintain.\\" Turning the forklift around with surprising dexterity, Dr. Robotnik huffed, \\"Fine, fine. But when I revolutionize this archaic shelving system, you'll all thank me!\\" # Chapter 3: The Stealth Expert Meanwhile, in the marketplace section, Sly Cooper, the master thief-turned-IKEA coworker, was deftly adjusting the layout of kitchen utensils and decorative plant pots. Despite his previous life of heists and escapades, he found a strange sense of peace in ensuring that customers could find their ideal GRUNDTAL kitchen accessories with ease. Yet his keen thief’s instincts never left him, allowing him to anticipate shopper's needs before they even realized it themselves. As Sly artfully arranged a display of PÄRLBAND tealight holders, a small group of teenagers attempted to sneak a set of oversized GOSIG GOLDEN plush dogs past without paying. Without missing a beat, Sly appeared before them with a knowing grin. \\"Planning a great escape with these fellas?\\" he asked, motioning to the plushes. The teens, caught off guard by the stealthy intervention, sheepishly returned the dogs to their cart. \\"Just remember, the only thing you're stealing here are great deals,\\" Sly remarked, his eyes glinting with amusement as the group hurried off to the checkout. # Chapter 4: Team IKEA As the day neared its end, the unlikely quartet of Master Chief, Soldier 76, Dr. Robotnik, and Sly Cooper clocked out, hanging up their uniforms to reclaim those identities that brought them such renown in other realms. \\"Sly, you got plans tonight?\\" Master Chief asked as they made their way to the staff exit. \\"Just the usual,\\" Sly replied. \\"Fine-tuning my pickpocketing... I mean, pick-upping my dry cleaning.\\" \\"I heard there’s a new virtual combat simulation in the arcade across the street,\\" suggested Soldier 76. \\"Maybe we can show these gamers what a real battlefront looks like.\\" Dr. Robotnik stroked his mustache thoughtfully, then expressed with a sly smile, \\"Perhaps I will join you. After all, it is scientifically proven that relaxation can enhance productivity.\\" The four stood for a moment, reflecting on their unexpected camaraderie born from the shared experience of working at IKEA. They may have come from very different worlds, but here, they were just employees striving to make it through the day—and in some odd way, that was uniting. \\"What do you say, team?\\" asked Soldier 76 as they stepped out into the evening air. Sly slid on his trademark cap, grinning, \\"Team IKEA, assemble!\\" The rest followed suit. As they shared a moment of laughter, each knew that tomorrow would bring another day filled with quaint Swedish names, Allen wrenches, and flat-pack furniture. Until then, they could enjoy a bit of rest, a shared battle in a game, and the bizarre but fitting friendship they had found in one another within the endless maze of IKEA."},{"prompt":"Ok maintenant je le veut en assis dans une auberge en train de manger un bouillon avec des gens en arriere plan.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, не веря себе, я сама побежала к своей похитительнице , в надежде что она сможет мне помочь","completion":"Я подбежала к ее машине, выкрикнув ее имя. Она медленно остановилась и открыла окно, смотря на меня с удивлением. Я рассказала ей о своем кошмаре и о том, как я чувствовала, что она моя спасительница. Она внимательно слушала меня, а затем улыбнулась и сказала, что совпадение просто удивительное. Ее имя было таким же, как и имя медсестры из моего сна. Она рассказала мне, что работает в поликлинике и помогает пациентам каждый день. Мы обменялись номерами телефонов и обещали увидеться снова. Этот сон оказался для меня пробуждением. Я осознала, что не стоит жить в изоляции и страхе, что каждый день может быть полон неожиданностей и возможностей. Я решила вернуться к поликлинике и встретиться с медсестрой, которая вызвала такие сильные эмоции в моем сердце. Возможно, это было лишь просто совпадение, но я была готова принять его как знак судьбы и идти на встречу новым возможностям и приключениям."},{"prompt":"I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver.

Tang Jinghan was acutely aware that the family patriarch would sooner or later demand the return of the \\"Dragon Seal\\" ring, and he had long devised countermeasures to confront this inevitability. \\"I shall handle this matter. You just need to see to the tasks I've assigned you.\\" \\"Yes, President Tang.\\" At noon, the family patriarch arrived at the hospital accompanied by Tang Jinghan's eldest son, Tang Qingdong. The patriarch's gaze fell tenderly upon his pale-faced grandson. \\"Jinghan, are you feeling better?\\" In truth, Tang Jinghan could have been transferred to a regular ward the day before; his continued presence in the hospital was a strategic choice to await the patriarch's visit. Feigning weakness, Tang Jinghan coughed lightly. \\"Grandfather, I nearly lost the chance to see you again.\\" \\"That's fortunate; you're safe now. Do rest up. The company is in good hands with your uncle and me; you needn't worry.\\" To the casual ear, these words sounded caring, but their underlying intent was a subtle power grab. Tang Jinghan, perceptive as he was, responded with a weak smile. \\"Grandfather, rest assured, while I may not be able to attend the company in person, that does not prevent me from managing its affairs. Moreover, the partners involved in the negotiations will not sign any contracts without my direct oversight.\\" This blunt truth soured Tang Qingdong's expression, prompting him to retort with thinly veiled irritation. \\"Jinghan, passing on negotiations is merely a matter of your word. If it weren't for the concern over your well-being, your grandfather and I would not wish to be burdened with these responsibilities!\\" \\"Thank you for your concern, Uncle. The projects are nearly finalized; only minor details need refining, which I am perfectly capable of handling alone.\\" \\"Do you think I'm doing this willingly? I simply don't want rumors to spread that Tang Corporation depends on an ailing CEO to remain afloat.\\" With a smile, Tang Jinghan replied, \\"If I am able to sustain our operations, it proves my injuries are not as grave as feared. Therefore, the company's stock remains stable. Is that not a positive outcome?\\" At a loss for words, Tang Qingdong fell silent. The patriarch had always known that Tang Jinghan would not easily relinquish control over the projects in his charge. After a light cough, the patriarch began, \\"Jinghan, I've come to discuss another matter with you.\\" Tang Jinghan thought to himself, \\"At last, the main event has arrived.\\" Preempting the conversation, he inquired, \\"Grandfather, are you referring to the matter of the family ring?\\" \\"Jinghan, although unforeseen circumstances during the assessment led to your brush with death, the fact remains you did not pass. Thus, you must return the ring.\\" Tang Qingdong chimed in, \\"Jinghan, the 'Dragon Seal' is the family's emblem of leadership. The hospital is replete with onlookers; it is unsafe in your possession.\\" \\"You are correct, Uncle. Once you've recovered, grandfather will arrange another assessment for you.\\" Tang Jinghan cast his eyes downward, his gaze falling upon his plastered leg, a chill settling in the depths of his eyes. \\"Grandfather, the physicians doubt I will be able to stand again. Do you believe I still have a chance to lead the family?\\" Upon hearing this, displeasure flitted across the patriarch's face. \\"What are you implying with such a statement?\\" Tang Qingdong interjected scornfully, \\"What else could it mean? He's simply being obstinate, unwilling to hand over the ring!\\" As he spoke, Shi Jin arrived outside the hospital room, holding a meal box, intending to leave it with the nurse and depart upon seeing Tang's family present. However, she noticed Tang Jinghan beckoning her. At the same moment, both the patriarch and Tang Qingdong turned to see her, their faces registering obvious displeasure at this interruption during a crucial conversation. Ignoring their hostility, Shi Jin greeted them with a polite smile, disinfected her hands, and entered the room. The patriarch's cold gaze settled on Shi Jin. \\"Jinghan, who is this woman?\\" Despite his intimidating posture, none in the room felt cowed. Deferring to Shi Jin, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> suggested, \\"Miss Shi, please introduce yourself.\\" Uncertain of Tang Jinghan's intentions, Shi Jin knew that the Tang family could easily investigate her background and her connection to him. Thus, she partially fabricated her explanation. \\"My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I had the chance to save President Tang in an incident at the marketplace. Coincidentally, my grandmother is also hospitalized here. So, I simply prepared an extra meal to deliver to President Tang.\\" Upon hearing Shi Jin had saved <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, a flicker of murderous intent crossed Tang Qingdong's slightly hooded eyes. The assailant responsible for Tang Jinghan's injuries had been critically wounded and apprehended by the police, preventing Tang Qingdong from gathering information. Consequently, he was unaware of how Tang Jinghan had escaped near-certain death. Learning this, he wished he could tear Shi Jin apart with his bare hands! The patriarch's scrutiny of Shi Jin intensified. \\"Miss Shi, I appreciate that you saved Jinghan. My assistant will later present you with a check for one million as a token of gratitude.\\" His words were diplomatic, but Shi Jin understood his intent: the patriarch wished to sever any ties between her and Tang Jinghan with this money. Shi Jin met the elder's stern gaze. \\"There's no need; President Tang has already compensated me.\\" Mistakenly believing that Shi Jin failed to grasp his insinuations, the patriarch elaborated bluntly. \\"Miss Shi, Jinghan's dietary needs are managed by professionals; your services are no longer required. Considering the scrutiny surrounding him, any proximity to you could be detrimental to both Jinghan and yourself.\\" Shi Jin replied curiously, \\"Why would close association with one's lifesaver be deemed inappropriate? Surely, President Tang isn't expected to be ungrateful?\\" The patriarch was taken aback by Shi Jin's retort, struggling to save face. Tang Jinghan, ignoring his grandfather's silent plea to dismiss Shi Jin, simply said, \\"Miss Shi, your cooking is delightful, and I thank you for it.\\" This acknowledgment prompted Tang Qingdong to regard Shi Jin anew, causing him to contemplate further schemes. After placing the meal box on the bedside table, Shi Jin added, \\"You're welcome. Please don't forget the promise you made to me, President Tang. I'll come by later to retrieve the meal box.\\" With that, she exited the room. Once the door closed behind her, the patriarch's anger became evident. \\"Jinghan, who is this Shi Jin to you? How well do you know her? Are you cognizant that she may have deliberately sought proximity to you?\\" Slowly, Tang Jinghan turned to lift the lid off the meal box, releasing the fragrant aroma of the food. \\"Grandfather, all I know is this—if not for Shi Jin, I would be reduced to ashes by now.\\" \\"Cease all contact with Shi Jin immediately; we wouldn't want any misunderstandings with your fiancée, affecting the planned alliance between our families.\\" Tang Jinghan's gaze shifted from the meal box to his grandfather's face. \\"Grandfather, when did I acquire a fiancée? I was not informed.\\" \\"Jinghan, you previously disagreed, and the Wen family's status was admittedly subpar. But your current circumstance...\\" His implication was clear: you're crippled now. Be content that Wen Yi is still willing to marry you. \\"Grandfather, arranged marriages are outmoded; I'll decide for myself whom to marry.\\" The patriarch dismissed Tang Jinghan's comment. Previously unable to control his strong-willed grandson, he now felt emboldened to manipulate his injured descendant. Reflecting on this, he steered the conversation back to the interrupted topic. \\"Jinghan, we can discuss you marriage later, after your discharge from the hospital. For now, relinquish the family ring that designates you as the successor.\\""},{"prompt":"напиши SWOT-анализ для интерактивного парка","completion":"SWOT-анализ для интерактивного парка: SWOT-анализ представляет собой инструмент для анализа сильных сторон (Strengths), слабых стороны (Weaknesses), возможностей (Opportunities) и угроз (Threats) бизнеса или организации.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Deep within a remote, clandestine facility hidden from the eyes of the world, four unusual figures stood in the sterilized corridors of the SCP Foundation, an organization dedicated to containing the world's most bizarre and dangerous anomalies known as SCPs—Secure, Contain, Protect. Master Chief, the towering Spartan-II super soldier, was a sight to behold in his Mjolnir powered armor. Standing next to him was Soldier 76, a grizzled military veteran whose tactical mind and combat experience were legendary, even if his real identity wasn't common knowledge. Beside them, Doctor Ivo \\"Eggman\\" Robotnik, the notorious genius with a proclivity for robotics, looked out of place in his red jacket and large goggles but had a mind invaluable to the organization. Finally, there was Sly Cooper, the gentleman thief turned Foundation operative; his agility and stealth skills were unmatched. Inside the site's operation room, the group received their briefing. \\"Agents,\\" the site director began, \\"we have a situation. SCP-096 has breached containment, and we need it secured before it causes a mass casualty event.\\" \\"So it's a snatch and grab?\\" Sly murmured, twirling his cane. \\"Been there, done that.\\" \\"Not exactly, Cooper,\\" the director replied dourly. \\"This isn't a crown jewel. It's a creature that can't be looked at or it'll tear you apart.\\" Master Chief's voice cut through the tension. \\"Where's the last known location?\\" \\"Sublevel 3, Section 14B. It's in the labyrinthine service corridors,\\" responded an operator, highlighting a map on the screen. \\"Exfil routes?\\" Soldier 76 asked, his tactical mindset coming to the fore. \\"You'll have three potential exit points,\\" said the site director, tracing lines on the diagram. \\"But be advised, Chief and Soldier, your weaponry might not be as effective against 096.\\" Doctor Eggman crossed his arms, thinking hard. \\"I may not be the brawns of the outfit, but I can potentially disrupt its senses with a sonic emitter. I'll need time to modify one of my drones.\\" \\"Good,\\" said Master Chief. \\"Cooper, you'll be point with your stealth. Lead us to the SCP without being spotted.\\" \\"Roger that,\\" Sly said, a confident smirk playing on his lips. As the team made their way to 14B, the tension increased with each step closer to the creature's last known location. Master Chief led from the front, his MA5B assault rifle raised and ready. Soldier 76 followed close behind, checking corners with his Heavy Pulse Rifle. \\"I'm in position above the corridor,\\" Sly whispered into his comms link, having silently climbed above the pipes along the ceiling. \\"Moving in.\\" Doctor Eggman trailed, clutching his robotic creation, an orb-like drone with articulated arms and a hastily attached sonic emitter. \\"Ready with the sound disruption. Just give me the signal.\\" They arrived at the service corridors, a maze of metal and utility pipes, the walls echoing with the faint, eerie sobs of SCP-096. Even through the filtered visors of their helmets, Chief and Soldier 76 avoided looking directly ahead, reliant on motion tracking and Sly's scouting. \\"Okay, team,\\" Sly's voice came quietly from the shadows, \\"it's directly below me, about fifteen meters. But it's not facing us. Now's the time to use Eggman's gadget.\\" \\"On it,\\" Eggman said, and he activated the device. The drone whirred to life, emitting a high-pitched frequency. SCP-096 flinched, covering its ears, seemingly disoriented. \\"Moving in,\\" Master Chief confirmed, advancing with precise, heavy steps. His motions were deliberate, trained to avoid provoking aggressive responses from unpredictable SCPs. Suddenly, 096 screamed, a sound that echoed through the metal corridors. \\"That's our cue!\\" yelled Soldier 76. \\"Lay down suppressive fire!\\" Both the Chief's and Soldier 76's weapons boomed through the corridor, rounds striking the creature, which was thrashing violently but not advancing any longer, thanks to Eggman's device. \\"Chief, use nonlethal rounds, aim for the legs!\\" Soldier 76 shouted, coordinating their efforts. Expertly, Master Chief switched ammo types, firing a barrage designed to incapacitate rather than kill. Meanwhile, Sly descended from the ceiling, using his cane to deftly swing onto the creature's back, securing a specialized tranquilizer onto SCP-096's neck. The beast staggered, its energy waning. \\"We have to move it now while it's stunned!\\" Soldier 76 barked, and Eggman's drone extended its arms, wrapping them around the creature to help facilitate its extraction. \\"Cooper, lead the way to the extraction!\\" Chief commanded, falling into step behind Soldier 76 as they provided cover fire. With Sly navigating through the corridors, they arrived at the containment cell just as the tranquilizer took full effect, and SCP-096 went limp. The group worked quickly to secure the creature in the reinforced cell, ensuring it faced the wall and its gaze could not meet any of theirs. Once the task was complete, they backed out of the cell, the door sliding shut with a satisfying hiss of locked-in security. \\"Well done, team,\\" the site director's voice came through their comms. \\"You've averted disaster today.\\" Doctor Eggman wiped the sweat from his brow with a grin of relief. \\"I'll admit, that was a little more excitement than I typically enjoy in my robotics lab.\\" \\"We're all in one piece; I'd say that's a victory,\\" Soldier 76 added, clapping a hand on Master Chief's armored shoulder. Sly twirled his cane with a flourish. \\"Just another day's work at the Foundation, though I wouldn't mind a little less creature wrangling in the future.\\" Master Chief merely nodded, his gaze already scanning the room for potential threats. \\"We'll debrief and prepare for the next operation. Stay vigilant—we're not done yet.\\" The odd ensemble of heroes and former villains had found a new camaraderie in their work at the SCP Foundation, a place where their unique skill sets could be put to use for the greater good. An uneasy alliance perhaps, yet they had proven that together, they were a formidable force against the unexplainable mysteries and horrors that lurked in the shadows."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In the shimmering glass skyline of New Mombasa, nestled amidst the architectural marvels of the twenty-third century, stood an office unlike any other - FutureTech Consolidated. An enigmatic company, it was known to serve as a melting pot for the multiverse, where beings of various dimensions, worlds, and times were brought together to work in a strange harmony. It was here we find four peculiar figures, known in their own realms as legends, but in this office, just another set of employees clocking in among the ranks. The elevator dinged on the 117th floor, its doors parting to reveal the towering figure of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. Swapping military fatigues for a sharp suit that did little to mask his super-soldier physique, he carried an air of authority as he strode into the bustling open office space. His eyes, though still hidden behind the golden visor, were fixed on his desk where certifications of marksmanship and combat commendations were replaced by sales awards and Employee of the Month plaques. Across the office, Jack Morrison, or as known in his previous life, 'Soldier 76', hunched over his desk, eyes squinting at a computer screen displaying exhaustive spreadsheets. Once a decorated soldier, he now battled with deadlines, his tactical prowess channeled into forecasting and financial strategies. \\"I didn't ask for this,\\" he muttered to himself, referencing his involuntary career change, rather than the mundane task at hand. \\"Jack, focus on the fiscal reports. We've got a presentation in an hour, and I need those numbers crunched,\\" barked Chief, his leadership tendencies as hard to shake as his powerful grip. \\"Aye, Chief. Give me ten,\\" Jack replied, fingers flying across the keyboard. His military discipline was as sharp as ever, even if his battlefield had turned into rows of cubicles. In the corner of the office, the infamous Dr. Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik had carved out his own tech lair, replete with monitors, gadgets, and machines whirring in orchestrated chaos. Once the master of robots and conquest, he now served as the company's lead engineer, his brilliance channeled into more lawful innovations. \\"My latest design will revolutionize the industry!\\" Eggman proclaimed loudly to no one in particular, his bombastic personality echoing across the room. Sly Cooper, on the other hand, found the office life more amusing. The notorious gentleman thief had traded heists for HR, using his stealth and charm to navigate workplace politics. He swiveled in his chair, raising an eyebrow as he tuned into Eggman's latest rant. \\"Revolutionize, or just cause a new type of mayhem, Doc?\\" he quipped, a smirk playing on his lips. Eggman bristled. \\"My dear Sly, you underestimate the power of legitimate enterprise! Why steal when you can create?\\" Just then, their boss, a sharply dressed woman known only as Director Seraphina, stepped out from her glass-walled office. \\"Gentlemen, I trust everything's on schedule?\\" \\"Everything's gonna be ready for the pitch, boss!\\" Sly answered smoothly, though his mischievous eyes hinted at his playful nature. Chief stood straighter, \\"We'll secure the contract. You can count on it, ma'am.\\" The conversation was interrupted as the door opened to a woman in lab attire, gasping for breath. \\"The AI! It's malfunctioning; we can't control it!\\" Without skipping a beat, Chief grabbed his tablet, his fingers danced across the screen as he accessed the building's security systems. \\"I'm on it. Jack, come with me.\\" Eggman rolled his eyes to the heavens. \\"Chaos is my specialty,\\" he declared, wheeling out from behind his fortress of technology, \\"allow me.\\" Sly chuckled and swiped a set of security cards from his drawer. \\"Might need a little 'extra' access. I'll shadow you guys.\\" The unlikely team rushed from the office, the various departments of FutureTech Consolidated yielding to their assertive strides. They reached the server room where alarms blared, and a holographic AI flickered menacingly above a core of surging power. Chief wasted no time, his fingers flew across his tablet, bypassing firewalls with military precision. \\"Jack, status on the backup generators?\\" \\"Bringing them online now,\\" Jack responded, syncing his own device with the building's infrastructure. Eggman scrutinized the core, muttering calculations. \\"This confinement matrix is ancient! Allow me to employ a little Eggman ingenuity,\\" he chuckled, cracking his knuckles before diving into the code. Sly stood at the threshold, glancing at the ID cards, and then back at the ongoing calamity. \\"You guys handle the tech. I'll make sure we don't have any... unwelcome guests.\\" His thieving instincts were buzzing – there was more to this malfunction than met the eye. Hours passed, their respective talents synergizing to form a potent force of resilience and ingenuity. Under Chief's command, Jack's tactics, Eggman's engineering, and Sly's craftiness, the crisis was not just averted but transformed into an opportunity. Triumphant, they returned to their office, their formal attire now ruffled but spirits unbeaten. Director Seraphina greeted them with a rare smile. \\"Gentlemen, it seems FutureTech Consolidated has averted a disaster, thanks to you.\\" Eggman puffed out his chest. \\"A mere trifle, Director.\\" Chief nodded solemnly, already back in business mode. \\"What's our next move?\\" \\"There's no rest for the exceptional, my team,\\" Seraphina said, a twinkle of pride in her eye. \\"Tomorrow, we embark on a new venture. For now, rest up. The multiverse doesn't save itself.\\" Chuckling, Sly added, \\"And here I thought this was just going to be another quiet day at the office.\\""},{"prompt":"Напиши роль природы в стихотворении «Смерть поэта» Лермонтова","completion":"Роль природы в стихотворении \\"Смерть поэта\\" Лермонтова является особенно яркой и символичной. Природа выступает как отражение и отражательница внутреннего мира поэта, его эмоций, настроений и мыслей. В начале стихотворения природа изображается как живая и обновляющая сила, наполненная светом и жизнью. Гармония природы отражает начало поэтического пути и творческую энергию поэта. Однако по мере развития сюжета стихотворения, настроение природы становится темным и мрачным, отражая печаль и отчаяние героя. Природа становится безликой и чуждой, отделяющей поэта от внешнего мира и окутывающей его одиночеством и отчуждением от окружающей среды. К концу стихотворения, когда герой умирает, природа остается безразличной и неодушевленной. Видение поэта о прекрасном и вечном исчезает, и природа, как обычно, продолжает свой ход. Таким образом, роль природы в стихотворении \\"Смерть поэта\\" Лермонтова заключается в создании сильного символического контраста между жизненной силой и печальным уходом поэта из этого мира."},{"prompt":"def pad_plaintext(plaintext): while len(plaintext) < 8: plaintext += \\"@\\" return plaintext[:8] def text_to_binary(text): binary_text = \\"\\" for char in text: binary_char = bin(ord(char))[2:].zfill(8) binary_text += binary_char return binary_text def split_blocks(plaintext): blocks = [] while len(plaintext) > 0: blocks.append(plaintext[:8]) plaintext = plaintext[8:] return blocks def ascii_to_binary_key(key): binary_key = \\"\\" for char in key: binary_key += format(ord(char), '08b') return binary_key def apply_key_permutation(binary_key, permutation_table): permuted_key = \\"\\" for index in permutation_table: permuted_key += binary_key[index -

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, не веря себе, я сама побежала к своей похитительнице, попросив её помочь мне завести машину","completion":"Она с удовольствием помогла мне, но с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: \\"Ты думаешь, что сможешь сбежать от меня так легко? Нет, теперь ты принадлежишь мне.\\" Я почувствовала, что сердце сжалось от страха. Больше нельзя игнорировать эту ситуацию, нужно что-то предпринять. Я решила попытаться убежать от нее и вызвать полицию. Я быстро выскочила из ее машины, не обращая внимания на ее крики и попытки меня удержать. Я бежала, стараясь не смотреть назад, и искала людей, которые могли бы помочь мне. Наконец, я обнаружила несколько людей на улице и закричала им о помощи. Они подошли ко мне и увидев мою запуганную и испуганную взгляд, поняли, что что-то не так. Я объяснила им свою ситуацию, и они немедленно вызвали полицию. Полицейские приехали быстро и начали расследование. Я объяснила им все, что произошло, и они обещали сделать все возможное, чтобы найти похитительницу и решить эту ситуацию. Я почувствовала себя немного облегченной, зная, что я не останусь одна в борьбе с этим кошмаром. Полиция начала свое расследование, собирая улики и свидетельские показания. Я сотрудничала с ними, помогая всячески, чтобы найти похитительницу. Несколько дней спустя, полиция обнаружила ее укрывавшуюся в городском подвале. Они арестовали ее и восстановили мою безопасность. Однако, даже после ареста, эта ситуация оставила на мне сильный след. Я ощущала постоянный страх и тревогу, переживая, что она будет свободной и возможно вернется ко мне. Я пошла на терапию, чтобы помочь справиться с последствиями этого кошмара и восстановить свою жизнь. В конце концов, я поняла, что нельзя доверять всем и что безопасность и собственная защита всегда должны быть на первом месте. Этот опыт сделал меня сильнее и научил осторожности. Я решила оставить прошлое позади и жить настоящим, сосредоточиваясь на себе и своем благополучии."},{"prompt":"The concept of lawmaking","completion":"Lawmaking is the process through which laws are created, modified, and enacted by legislative bodies. It is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance, as it allows society to establish and enforce rules that govern its members' behavior and maintain social order. The process of lawmaking involves several steps and typically begins with the identification of an issue or problem that requires legislative intervention. This may come about through public demand, government initiatives, or the need to address emerging social, economic, or technological developments. Once an issue is identified, lawmakers, who are typically elected representatives in a legislative body such as a parliament or congress, propose laws to address the issue. These proposals, known as bills, can be introduced by individual legislators or by the executive branch of government. Bills may go through multiple revisions and amendments as they are debated and refined. The next step in the lawmaking process is the consideration and discussion of the bill in the legislative body. This involves debates, hearings, and committee reviews, where lawmakers examine the bill's content and scrutinize its potential impact. Amendments can be proposed and incorporated into the bill to modify its provisions. Following the deliberation stage, the bill is put to a vote. In some legislative bodies, it needs a simple majority to pass and become law, while in others, it may require a supermajority or a specific percentage of votes. If the bill is passed, it moves on to the next stage. The bill is then sent to the executive branch for approval or veto. The executive, usually headed by the president or governor, reviews the bill and decides whether to sign it into law or reject it. If signed, the bill becomes law and is implemented, while if vetoed, it can be sent back to the legislative branch for further consideration or, in some cases, overridden by a supermajority vote. Lawmaking is an ongoing process, as laws can be amended, repealed, or replaced to meet changing societal needs. It requires collaboration, compromise, and careful consideration of the potential consequences of laws on individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. The goal of lawmaking is to create a legal framework that promotes justice, equity, and the well-being of the community it governs."},{"prompt":"cách lựa chọn mặt bằng ở đại học mở cơ sở nhà bè làm quán cà phê tự phục vụ cho học sinh, sinh viên","completion":"Khi lựa chọn mặt bằng để mở quán cà phê tự phục vụ cho học sinh và sinh viên ở Đại học Mở Cơ sở Nhà Bè, bạn có thể xem xét những yếu tố sau: 1.

Он с радостью принялся за новое интересное дело, но не учел, что в этот раз улик оказалось слишком много, и все они имеют совершенно разный \\"вес\\" для проведения расследовния. Шерлок нашел в телефонной книжке номер самого талантливого программиста в городе, которым оказались Вы, и обратился за помощью. Обладая знаниями алгоритмов и структур данных и проанализировав ситуацию, Вы решили хранить все зацепки в виде АВЛ-дерева, чтобы при необходимости достаточно быстро находить любой объект, при этом учитывая вес каждого свидетельства. Во время расследования дела, Вам предстоит не только добавлять новые улики, но и удалять те, которые уже потеряли актуальность, а также проверять наличие определенных улик. К сожалению, не все знают как работает АВЛ-дерево, поэтому коллеги попросили Вас выводить баланс дерева после каждой операции вставки и удаления. Входные данные В первой строке находится число � n ( 1 ≤ � ≤ 2 ∗ 1 0 5 ) (1≤n≤2∗10 5 ) - число операций. Изначально улик нет. В каждой из последующих � n строк находится описание одной из трех операций: � A � x - поместить улику с весом � x в дерево. Если она уже было добавлена, операция игнорируется � D � x - удалить потерявшую актуальность улику, которое имеет вес � x. Если такой нет, операция игнорируется. � C � x - проверить наличие улики с весом � x. Выходные данные Для каждой операции вида � C � x выведите � Y, если такая улика содержится в дереве, и � N, если не содержится. Для каждой операции вида � A � x или � D � x выведите баланс корня дерева после выполнения операции. Если дерево пустое (в нем нет вершин), выведите 0 0. Вывод для каждой операции должен содержаться на отдельной строке. STDIN STDOUT 6 A 3 A 4 A 5 C 4 C 6 D 5 0 1 0 Y N -1 Примечание Операции вставки и удаления требуется реализовать точно так же, как это было сделано в предыдущих задачах, потому что в ином случае баланс корня может отличаться от требуемого.","completion":"Приведенный вами код содержит ошибку при установке родительских ссылок после поворотов, их нужно исправить, чтобы сохранить соответствующие отношения в AVL-дереве.

Если вы продолжаете испытывать трудности с прохождением тестов, проверьте логику работы вашего дерева на предмет других потенциальных ошибок.

In a GPON network, a single strand of fiber optic cable is used to transmit and receive data from a central office to the end-user. This fiber optic cable is divided into multiple strands or channels, where each channel can be allocated to an individual user or building. GPON technology uses a passive optical splitter to divide the signal within the network, allowing multiple users to share the same fiber optic cable. This method of signal splitting enables high-speed data transmission and keeps the overall cost of deploying the network lower compared to other fiber optic technologies. The GPON system consists of an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) located at the central office and an Optical Network Unit (ONU) installed at the customer premises. The OLT is responsible for transmitting and receiving data to and from the ONU, while the ONU interfaces with the end-user's devices such as computers, phones, or television set-top boxes. GPON networks can deliver symmetrical speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps downstream and 1.25 Gbps upstream, providing fast internet access for multiple users simultaneously. The technology also supports various services including high-definition television, voice over IP, video conferencing, and other bandwidth-intensive applications. Overall, GPON technology offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for delivering high-speed broadband services over fiber optic networks, making it a popular choice for telecom operators and internet service providers."},{"prompt":"Напиши заключение по теме Планирование и организация импорта телефонных аппаратов из Китая","completion":"В заключение, планирование и организация импорта телефонных аппаратов из Китая является сложным и трудоемким процессом, требующим внимания к множеству деталей.

Zbliż się z empatią: Staraj się zrozumieć ludzi i ich uczucia. Stawiaj się w ich sytuacji, zastanów się, jak byś się czuł na ich miejscu. Rozwijaj swoją empatię, aby lepiej odczytywać i reagować na potrzeby innych. 2. Kontroluj swoje emocje: W momencie, gdy czujesz, że frustracja czy złość zaczynają brać górę, staraj się zatrzymać i odstawić na bok swoje negatywne emocje. Wyćwicz umiejętność samokontroli poprzez techniki oddechowe, medytację lub rozmowę z zaufanymi osobami. 3. Myśl przed mówieniem: Zanim coś powiesz, zastanów się, jakie mogą być konsekwencje twoich słów. Pozwól sobie na chwilę refleksji, aby uniknąć obrażania lub raniących innych swoimi słowami. Pamiętaj, że słowa mają moc i mogą mieć długotrwały wpływ na innych. 4. Bądź wyrozumiały: Nie wszyscy mają takie same doświadczenia, przekonania czy poglądy. Staraj się być bardziej otwarty na różnice i tolerancyjny wobec innych perspektyw. Szanuj to, że każdy człowiek ma prawo do swojego zdania i podejścia do życia. 5. Praktykuj wdzięczność: Często skupiamy się na negatywach i łatwo jest zapomnieć o tym, co mamy dobrego w swoim życiu. Próbuj regularnie zauważać i doceniać pozytywne aspekty swojego życia, jak i innych osób. Dzięki temu, będziesz bardziej w stanie być miły i łagodny wobec innych. 6. Bądź hojny: Ciesz się z okazji do pomocy innym. Zachęcaj do korzystania z dobrego, jakie masz w sobie. Bycie hojnym nie tylko wzmacnia twoje pozytywne cechy, ale także rozwija wewnętrzne poczucie spełnienia i satysfakcji. 7. Przepraszaj i ucz się na błędach: Jeśli kiedykolwiek zachowasz się nieodpowiednio lub okrutnie wobec innych, nie wahaj się przeprosić. Przyjmij odpowiedzialność za swoje czyny i staraj się wyciągać naukę z tych sytuacji. Postanów działać inaczej w przyszłości. 8. Pomyśl o konsekwencjach: Przed podjęciem jakiegokolwiek działania zastanów się, jakie mogą być konsekwencje tych działań dla innych osób. Zadaj sobie pytanie, czy to, co zamierzasz zrobić, jest fair i nie narusza praw i granic innych ludzi. Pamiętaj, że praca nad tym, aby być mniej okrutnym, jest ciągłym procesem. Każdy z nas popełnia błędy, ale ważne jest, aby dążyć do rozwoju i poszukiwać możliwości poprawy."},{"prompt":"I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver.

He wished to offer some explanation, yet felt that any words he might utter would only serve to demean himself. \\"Miss Shi, I apologize.\\" Although Shi Jin had little fondness for being the subject of gossip, she understood Han Chuan's concern as being within reason. \\"Rest assured, Assistant Han, I harbor no interest towards President Tang, the Tang family, or the Tang Corporation.\\" Had it not been for the necessity to save her grandmother, she would never have become entangled with Tang Jin Han. Tang Jin Han observed Shi Jin’s earnest countenance and replied with equal seriousness, \\"I trust you, Miss Shi. May our collaboration be a pleasurable one.\\" \\"Likewise.\\" Han Chuan drove them to the Civil Affairs Bureau. Today was not auspicious for weddings—the counter for marriage registration was deserted, while the line for divorce was bustling. Shi Jin looked towards the crowded side with a silent hope for swift proceedings. Catching her gaze, Tang Jin Han joked, \\"One must first obtain a marriage license before qualifying for a divorce certificate.\\" His remarks, strangely out of place, attracted the curious stares of many bystanders. As Shi Jin was not a public figure, and Tang Jin Han shunned interviews, they went unrecognized, which rendered the surrounding gossip unrestrained and audacious. \\"What’s the point of marrying if they’re already thinking of divorce? They must have too much time on their hands!\\" \\"This is a dose of reality, a reminder to any despicable man—if you don’t treat your wife right, divorce is imminent!\\" “The lady appears quite young, and the gentleman is disabled. Could she be coerced into marriage?” In the midst of disarrayed discussion, Tang Jin Han and Shi Jin found themselves the uncomfortable center of attention. A man, about forty, in a rush to divorce, impatiently urged the distracted civil servant, \\"Stop looking around, hurry up and stamp the document!\\" While making this demand, he glanced inadvertently at the pair now under scrutiny. Shi Jin inadvertently blocked the view of Tang Jin Han, seated in his wheelchair, but the man caught sight of Han Chuan pushing it. Surprise evident in his eyes, he queried, “Assistant Han?” After receiving his divorce certificate, the man quickly followed them to uncover the truth. He was a step too late, as Tang Jin Han and Shi Jin had already entered a VIP room—accessible only to those of wealth and influence. Although he hadn't seen Tang Jin Han, he spied Han Chuan at the doorway and muttered to himself, \\"Only President Tang has the authority to command Assistant Han's service.\\" He immediately left the Civil Affairs Bureau and contacted the Tang family’s steward via phone. \\"Steward Chen, is the old master aware that President Tang is here at the Civil Affairs Bureau getting married?\\" Another informant had once reported to the old master to substantial reward. If his information proved valuable, he was certain of a handsome payment. Steward Chen, clueless, responded, “Xiao Xu, what are you talking about?\\" “You know I took leave today to get a divorce, right? I just happened to see President Tang and a very pretty girl collecting a license.\\" “Are you certain you're not mistaken?” The man known as \\"Xiao Xu\\" was wary of speaking too definitively, lest a misunderstanding cost him his job as a driver. “Due to the angle, I didn’t see President Tang, but I did see Assistant Han pushing a wheelchair. The voice of the person in the wheelchair greatly resembled President Tang’s.\\" Convinced by the evidence of the wheelchair and Han Chuan’s presence, Steward Chen wasted no time in contacting the Tang patriarch. At the moment, the old master was in a meeting at Tang Corporation. Seeing the call, he announced, “We’ll take a ten-minute recess.” The steward wouldn’t interrupt his work hours without reason. Old Master Tang retreated to his nearby office to take the call, which was immediately flooded with Steward Chen's anxious voice. \\"Young Master is currently at the Civil Affairs Bureau getting married.\\" The revelation left Old Master Tang flustered. \\"Old Chen, what are you saying?\\" The steward repeated the information. “Although the driver didn’t see the young master himself, he did see Assistant Han.\\" Without hesitation, Old Master Tang ended the call and contacted Tang Jin Han. The phone rang as Tang Jin Han was filling out the necessary forms, and he recognized the caller instantly. Though initially disregarding it, the insistent ringing from Old Master Tang prompted Shi Jin to remark, \\"Take it, it's quite distracting.\\" Tang Jin Han set aside his pen and answered the call. \\"Grandfather, is something the matter?\\" The old man’s voice was charged with anger, “Are you at the Civil Affairs Bureau getting married right now?” \\"Yes.\\" \\"Is it that Shi Jin?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Two affirmative answers nearly incensed the old man to the point of apoplexy. \\"Jin Han, you must leave the Civil Affairs Bureau at once. The woman who marries you must be of suitable status for the sake of Tang Corporation's future!\\" Their quiet VIP room allowed the words to reach not only Tang Jin Han but also Shi Jin and the clerking officer. The officer cast a surreptitious glance towards Shi Jin, who seemed unfazed, earning a silent commendation. It was a temperament she knew she couldn’t emulate if demeaned so. Her gaze then shifted to Tang Jin Han in anticipation of his choice. Tang Jin Han replied calmly and deliberately, “Grandfather, as I’ve said before, I alone shall decide whom to marry and who shall bear the name of Mrs. Tang.\\" Old Master Tang’s temper flared, \\"You were born into a prestigious family; you cannot have autonomy over your marriage!\\" “What if I am resolved to marry Shi Jin?” “Then you will resign as CEO and leave Tang Corporation!\\" Shi Jin watched <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> for his reaction to this momentous decision. With an unfazed countenance, he gave no indication of distress. As silence lingered on the call, Old Master Tang thought Tang Jin Han was deliberating and softened his tone, \\"Jin Han, marriage demands equality in social status. You and Shi Jin will find no happiness together. It’s not worth losing the position of CEO over her.\\" A trace of an emotionless smile curled on Tang Jin Han’s lips. \\"Grandfather, I understand your concern for me, but to me, marriage is not a transaction; it is about creating a home for the one you love.\\" The old man's fury resurged, \\"So, you’d rather leave Tang Corporation for a woman of no worth?\\" \\"Yes.\\" The call ended abruptly following his response. Turning off the phone, Tang Jin Han completed his form, signed it, and handed it over to the clerk, who confirmed the details with a smile. \\"Will you be providing your own marriage photo, or shall we take one here?\\" Shi Jin produced an edited marriage photo. Hesitating briefly before passing it to the clerk, she sought confirmation from Tang Jin Han. \\"President Tang, have you truly decided?\\" Resigning as CEO was no trivial matter. \\"Miss Shi, I stand by my decisions, unaffected by any unforeseen circumstances.\\" The clerk sensed Tang Jin Han’s strong affection for Shi Jin; he wouldn’t forsake his position otherwise. Yet, their formal address for each other was curiously impersonal—as if they were strangers. Ignoring the clerk’s bemused expression, Shi Jin handed over the photo. \\"Please process our marriage license.\\" Soon after, a marriage certificate adorned with the official seal was prepared. Only one thought occupied Shi Jin’s mind as she regarded the burgundy document—she was one step closer to the antidote. As for Tang Jin Han, the marriage was purely transactional. Nonetheless, they played their roles, extending hands to each other with a faint smile. \\"Mr. Tang/Mrs. Tang, for the rest of our lives, please be my guide.\\""},{"prompt":"What does \\"filiżanka\\" mean?","completion":"\\"Filiżanka\\" is a Polish word that means \\"cup\\" in English, typically used to refer to a small cup used for serving coffee or tea, often accompanied by a saucer.

Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Gordon Freeman, the silent but resourceful scientist, walked through the aisles of IKEA with a purpose. The gleaming emblem on his orange crowbar reflected the bright fluorescent lights of the store. His glasses were perched on his nose as he made mental notes of the stock levels of each shelf. In what was an unspeakably strange turn of fate, he had found himself working retail alongside characters equally misplaced in the home furnishing world. Beside him was the bald enigma known as Agent 47, dressed not in his usual suit and tie, but rather the yellow and blue uniform of IKEA. His barcode, usually a sign of his deadly vocation, was now obscured by a blue cap with the IKEA logo emblazoned on the front. His hands, which had ended the lives of countless targets, were now carefully arranging LINNMON table tops. \\"You know, Freeman,\\" 47 said without looking at Gordon, whose silent nature was appreciated here more than anywhere else, \\"this job requires a certain... precision. Just like any other.\\" Gordon nodded, not that he would have replied anyway. He had not spoken a word since this strange coalition of characters had come together, and yet his silence spoke volumes. Across from them, Geese Howard, a fearsome martial artist and crime lord, was surprisingly at ease explaining to customers the differences between HÄRLANDA and KIVIK sofas. A patron, a young mother with two rambunctious children, was trying to understand the merits of one over the other. \\"Predictabo!\\" Geese stated with a grin, pointing to the HÄRLANDA like it was an opponent to be defeated. \\"This sofa, you see, has a deeper seat depth. Perfect for full-body relaxation... Hmph.\\" His intimidating aura, coupled with his newfound couch expertise, was oddly persuasive. The mother, slightly overwhelmed but charmed nonetheless, agreed to the HÄRLANDA. In a more secluded section of the store—the warehouse—Bowser, King of the Koopas, was operating a forklift with surprising delicacy. Towering shelves of flat-packed furniture surrounded him, as he placed a heavy box labeled 'HEMNES' onto the high shelf. His spiked shell had scratched a few displays in his first days, but he had since mastered the art of maneuvering in tight human spaces. \\"Hey Bowser, be mindful! We can't afford more damaged goods,\\" 47 called out with a smirk, his hands adeptly securing a FJÄLLBO shelf unit for a customer's order. \\"Rrrgh, don't worry about me, Mister Clean!\\" Bowser growled back, his voice rumbling through the warehouse, \\"I've conquered entire kingdoms! I think I can handle a few boxes.\\" The unlikely team worked efficiently, each in their own unique way contributing to the daily operations of the store. As sunset approached, and the PA system announced the store was closing soon, they regrouped near the Bistro, where Gordon silently enjoyed a veggie hotdog, 47 opted for a coffee, Geese nibbled on some Swedish meatballs, and Bowser struggled with a DAIM cake with his oversized claws. \\"So,\\" Geese reminisced, his mouth full, \\"from fighting in the streets to selling EKTORP armchairs, eh? Life sure comes at you fast.\\" Agent 47 took a sip of his coffee, \\"We adapt, we survive. It's what we do best.\\" Bowser, finally taking a bite out of his cake, grunted in agreement, \\"Plus, it's not so bad. No plumbers jumping on my head here.\\" Gordon just silently chuckled, causing the other three to raise an eyebrow in surprise. Even without words, the camaraderie among them was palpable. As night descended on the blue and yellow building, the store empty and quiet, the four found themselves standing outside, looking up at the stars that shone brightly in the clear sky. Agent 47 turned to Gordon, who was leaning on his crowbar, \\"Tomorrow, we do it all again. Who would've thought?\\" Gordon, always the silent protagonist, gave him a nod and a slight smile, as if to say he, too, would never have believed it if he hadn't lived it. Geese clapped a firm hand on Bowser and Agent 47's shoulders, \\"Perhaps in another life, we were all warriors on different battlefields. But in this one, we're warriors of interior design!\\" Bowser let out a booming laugh, shaking his head, \\"Only you would equate battlefields with selling furniture, Geese.\\" With that, they locked up the store and went their separate ways, ready to return in the morning and embark on another day of IKEA camaraderie. This odd job may not have been what they were born to do, but it was what they were doing now—and doing quite well, at that. In a place where worlds converged in the strangest of ways, Gordon Freeman, Agent 47, Geese Howard, and Bowser had found a peculiar but peaceful kind of employment, each bringing their own set of skills to the Swedish home furnishing table."},{"prompt":"В один прекрасный день, я пришла в поликлинику за талоном к врачу и стоя в очереди к свободному окну регистратуры, приметила симпатичную медсестру, и пока шла очередь я не могла отвести от неё глаз, с каждым человеком кому она выдавала талон, я всё ближе и ближе приближалась к ней и вот он тот самый момент, когда во всей очереди осталась стоять только я, подойдя к стойке регистратуры я взглянула на неё в полной мере и неожиданно замерла. Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, не веря себе, я сама побежала к своей похитительнице, попросив её помочь мне завести машину Она с удовольствием помогла мне, но с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Ты думаешь, что сможешь сбежать от меня так легко? Нет, теперь ты принадлежишь мне.” став меня неожиданно целовать, она усадила меня в мою машину","completion":"и сама села на пассажирское сидение. Моя судьба опять оказалась в ее руках, и я поняла, что сбежать уже не получится. Мы отправились куда-то, и я не могла предугадать, что она задумала для меня. Мои мысли запутались, и я поняла, что мне нужно найти способ освободиться от нее и вернуть свою свободу. Время шло, и я смотрела в окно, надеясь увидеть здание или людей, которые могли бы помочь мне. Но вокруг была только пустыня, и никого не было видно. Она пристально смотрела на меня, словно читая мои мысли. Мои надежды начали исчезать, пока вдруг мы проехали мимо маленькой деревни. Я взглянула на нее с надеждой в глазах и сказала, что предлагаю свернуть и найти помощь. На моей неожиданностью, она согласилась и повернула в сторону деревни. Мои сердце забилось от радости, понимая, что возможность спастись может быть ближе, чем я думала. Мы въехали в деревню и я начала кричать на помощь, но никто из жителей не откликался. Было странно, как будто все здесь пропали. Вдруг, я увидела дом, из окна которого смотрела девушка - моя регистратура из поликлиники. Я направилась к дому, в надежде, что она поможет мне. В доме оказалась лишь она, она улыбнулась мне, и я поняла, что я была запутана в сети ее тайн. Она объяснила, что все происходящее было частью эксперимента моего подсознания, и что никакой похитительницы не существовало. Это была всего лишь игра моего разума. Я была смешана чувствами облегчения и разочарования. Оказалось, что все, что я пережила, было лишь иллюзией моей собственной психологии. Она добавила, что то, что мы испытали вместе, может помочь мне разобраться в себе и найти свою истинную судьбу.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Sequential Analysis proof","completion":"Sequential analysis is a statistical method used for analyzing data as it is collected. Unlike fixed-sample size analyses, where the number of observations is determined in advance, sequential analysis allows data to be evaluated as it comes in, and a decision can be made at any point to stop the experiment and accept one of the hypotheses. The most renowned work on Sequential Analysis is by Abraham Wald, who developed the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). Here's the essence of Wald's SPRT, though a full proof would require a lot more detail and mathematical rigor: Suppose we have two simple hypotheses, (H_0) and (H_1), and observations (X_1, X_2, ...). We want to decide between these two hypotheses. We assume that the (X_i) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), with probability density functions (f_0(x)) under (H_0) and (f_1(x)) under (H_1). We define the likelihood ratio after (n) observations as: [ LR_n = frac{prod_{i=1}^n f_1(X_i)}{prod_{i=1}^n f_0(X_i)} ] Wald's SPRT says to continue sampling until (LR_n) goes outside of certain bounds. Specifically, we choose two constants (A) and (B) such that (0 < B < 1 < A), and these are selected based on desired error rates (type I and type II errors). Then: - If (LR_n leq B), we accept (H_0). - If (LR_n geq A), we accept (H_1). - If (B < LR_n < A), we take another observation. One important result is the Wald's Approximation, which gives an approximation to the average sample number (ASN), which is the expected number of observations needed before reaching a decision. To actually prove that this test has the properties Wald claims—such as controlling type I and type II error rates—a lot of theoretical work is required involving Martingales, likelihood ratios, and properties of exponential families of distributions. The proof of the optimality of the SPRT, which is that it minimizes the expected sample size among all tests with the same error probabilities, uses proof by contradiction and relies on the likelihood ratio being a sufficient summary of the data up to any stopping point, which in turn relies on Wald's famous likelihood ratio identity. Would you like a specific proof or concept within sequential analysis explained?"},{"prompt":"Proof of determination of the values of the constants A and B","completion":"Determining the values of the constants ( A ) and ( B ) in a Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is essential because they define the thresholds for making decisions about whether to accept ( H_0 ) or ( H_1 ). These thresholds are related to the acceptable levels of Type I and Type II errors, denoted by ( alpha ) and ( beta ), respectively. Here is a general approach to determining the constants ( A ) and ( B ): 1. **Type I error (( alpha ))**: This is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (a false positive). It is set by the investigator before the test is performed. The value of ( A ) is related to the Type I error: [ alpha = P(text{reject } H_0 | H_0 text{ is true}) = P(LR_n geq A | H_0 text{ is true}) ] 2. **Type II error (( beta ))**: This is the probability of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis (a false negative). This error level is also chosen by the investigator. The value of ( B ) is related to the Type II error: [ beta = P(text{accept } H_0 | H_1 text{ is true}) = P(LR_n leq B | H_1 text{ is true}) ] To find ( A ) and ( B ), you typically would solve the following inequalities: [ A geq frac{1-beta}{alpha}, quad B leq frac{beta}{1-alpha} ] However, calculating ( A ) and ( B ) precisely involves more complex steps, where we would take the log of the likelihood ratio to simplify the expression (since the log function is monotonic, it preserves inequalities): [ log(LR_n) = sum_{i=1}^n logleft(frac{f_1(X_i)}{f_0(X_i)}right) ] Now, instead of finding ( A ) and ( B ), we find the logarithmic boundaries ( log(A) ) and ( log(B) ), so the decision rules become: [ text{If } log(LR_n) leq log(B), text{ accept } H_0 ] [ text{If } log(LR_n) geq log(A), text{ accept } H_1 ] We need to calculate the thresholds such that the accumulated log-likelihood ratio will trigger a decision with the specified error rates. Wald provided the following approximations for ( log(A) ) and ( log(B) ): [ log(A) approx logleft(frac{1-beta}{alpha}right) ] [ log(B) approx logleft(frac{beta}{1-alpha}right) ] The exact determination of ( A ) and ( B ) usually requires iterative methods since we don't have closed-form solutions for these bounds given arbitrary distributions and error requirements. For specific types of distributions (like the normal distribution), formulas might be derived to express ( A ) and ( B ) more directly in terms of standard deviation and the difference in means under the two hypotheses."},{"prompt":"知识库时间","completion":"知识库时间，或者称为知识截止日期，是指人工智能系统或知识库中包含的信息更新截止到的时间点。对于我的情况，我的训练数据包含的信息是截止到2023年4月前的。这意味着在此时间点之后发生的事件、发展或更新我可能不会知晓，因为我没有接收到更新的数据。"},{"prompt":"你是什么版本的","completion":"作为一个由 OpenAI 创建的人工智能模型，我是基于 GPT-3 (第三代生成性预训练变换器) 构建的。GPT-3 是截至到我知识截止日期前的最新版本，它在2020年推出。如果你是在查询我具体的迭代版本或更新补丁，请注意，OpenAI 不公开发布详细的版本号或更新日志。因此，我无法为你提供具体的版本号。所有关于我的能力和知识都基于截止到2023年4月的数据和算法训练。如果有任何新的重大更新或版本发布是在那个时间点之后的，我将无法提供信息。"},{"prompt":"你是GPT-4吗","completion":"很抱歉，我无法提供个人版本的具体信息，因为作为一个 AI 模型，我没有自我识别的版本信息。然而，截至我的知识更新日期在2023年4月，OpenAI发布的最新的大规模语言模型是 GPT-3。如果在那之后有新的迭代如 GPT-4 被发布，我将不会有那方面的信息。需要注意的是，OpenAI 可能会不定期更新它们的模型和技术，但这些更新可能不会明显标记为一个新的版本号，而是对现有模型的持续改进。"},{"prompt":"I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver.

Once in the car, Han Chuan inquired, \\"Director Tang, where shall we head to now?\\" Tang Jinghan did not respond immediately; he turned to Shi Jin and said, \\"Grandfather is aware of our marriage; you'll need to move in with me to maintain the facade of a loving couple.\\" Shi Jin was responsible for taking care of Madame Su and didn't want to stray too far from the hospital. \\"Director Tang...\\" She was interrupted by Tang Jinghan before she could finish, \\"Ah Jin, we are husband and wife now; our manner of address mustn't be so impersonal.\\" Hearing herself called \\"Ah Jin\\" felt peculiar to Shi Jin. It was the first time someone she was not close with had addressed her so intimately, and it was a sensation she found hard to adjust to. The name \\"Jinghan\\" took a long while to ferment in her mouth before she could speak it aloud. \\"Jinghan, grandmother's condition could worsen at any time; I need to be near to care for her. Would you consider moving into my apartment?\\" Her rented apartment spanned nearly a hundred square meters, which was ample space for the both of them. Hearing Shi Jin address him tenderly, Tang Jinghan's ears itched with a softer tone. \\"I have a duplex not too far from the hospital that we could use as our matrimonial home.\\" He had visited Shi Jin's apartment before, but it was too small for his taste, and in his opinion, not secure enough. Shi Jin didn't outright refuse but asked, \\"How far is 'not too far'?\\" \\"Approximately a two-minute drive to the hospital.\\" Shi Jin was content with the distance. \\"That is acceptable. Inform me of the address, and after I've delivered lunch to grandmother, I shall pack my belongings and move in.\\" Upon hearing this, Tang Jinghan suddenly remembered something he had yet to inquire about. \\"Ah Jin, does your grandmother know about our marriage?\\" \\"She is unaware, so there's no need for you to make time to deal with her; you might as well treat her as a stranger.\\" \\"That's fine, I understand.\\" After escorting Shi Jin to the entrance of her apartment building and leaving her with the address of the duplex, Tang Jinghan departed. Returning to her apartment, Shi Jin packed her luggage quickly and efficiently. She only took winter clothing and personal toiletries, which fit perfectly in a large suitcase. She had no intention of giving up the apartment as the status of her marriage to Tang Jinghan was precarious. Casually tossing the marriage certificate into the drawer of the bedside table, she proceeded to the kitchen to cook. After finishing, she realized she had prepared too much food. \\"Such are the perils of habit,\\" Shi Jin remarked in jest and carried the meal to the hospital. Madame Su, upon seeing Shi Jin with just a single meal container, questioned, \\"Little Jin, why haven't you prepared food for your male friend?\\" Each time Madame Su mentioned \\"male friend,\\" there was an enigmatic smile playing at the corners of her mouth. Having given up on explaining the situation, Shi Jin simply arranged the meal and responded, \\"He has been discharged, so there's no longer a need to prepare his meals.\\" \\"It is well that he's been discharged; it signifies his recovery. When will you bring him to meet me?\\" \\"If fate decrees it, you will meet him.\\" The cryptic nature of her response made Madame Su anticipate eagerly. After the meal, Shi Jin accompanied Madame Su downstairs to bask in the sunlight. No sooner had they exited the hospital building than they encountered Dong Man and Su Mingzhu. Dressed in coats of matching camel hue, beaming smiles adorning their faces, they carried fruit and pastries. \\"Mother, are you heading to the garden? Allow me to accompany you,\\" Dong Man offered, passing the fruit basket to Shi Jin. \\"Little Jin, take these to the room; everything is to grandmother's liking,\\" Dong Man insisted. Shi Jin declined to accept the offering. She could not trust so unscrupulous a pair to tend to her grandmother. \\"Miss Dong, it would be more appropriate for you to present these fruits to grandmother personally.\\" Madame Su heartily agreed, \\"Little Man, please take them for me; Little Jin and I have matters to discuss.\\" Though somewhat reluctant, Dong Man grasped that she could not impose upon the old lady or Shi Jin and took the pastries from Su Mingzhu's hand. \\"Mingzhu, accompany your grandmother, engage in conversation,\\" Dong Man instructed. Su Mingzhu nodded knowingly at her mother's suggestion, \\"Mother, I shall.\\" Shi Jin could not discern their motive but remained vigilant. The sun offered a gentle warmth cascading over them, the soft breeze lazily tangling her hair in delightful comfort. \\"Grandmother, the breeze has a bit of a chill to it, would you like a blanket?\\" Before she could finish, Su Mingzhu chimed in, \\"Certainly, grandmother needs to stay warm; aging limbs are vulnerable to the cold.\\" No sooner said than done, she retrieved a woolen blanket from the wheelchair's pouch. Shi Jin quickly intercepted Su Mingzhu's wrist, passing the blanket to Madame Su. \\"Grandmother, please wrap yourself.\\" She harbored suspicions that Su Mingzhu harbored ill will; best to minimize her contact with the old lady. Su Mingzhu's displeasure was evident as she confronted Shi Jin, \\"What do you mean by this? Grandmother isn't yours alone; why prohibit me from caring for her?\\" \\"Because I do not trust you.\\" \\"You…\\" Madame Su intervened just as Su Mingzhu attempted to retort. \\"Mingzhu, your willingness to donate bone marrow to me is appreciated, but if you quarrel with Little Jin, I shall side with her without question.\\" The comment neared the height of maddening Su Mingzhu. \\"Grandmother, I am your blood-related granddaughter; why do you continually exhibit such blatant partiality?\\" Madame Su turned a discerning gaze upon the incensed Su Mingzhu. \\"Every human heart is tender; I favor those who treat me well. Do you see fault in that?\\" Su Mingzhu had to admit, she loathed this matriarch who had taken pleasure in provoking her since her return to the Su family. And yet... \\"Your life was granted by me!\\" Without that life, what would the old lady hold dear? \\"Don't you fear that angering me might lead me to retract the precious gift of life?\\" Should medical crisis strike without the prospect of a marrow transplant, her lifespan might ebb away within a week. Although the old woman treasured her existence, she was not afraid of death. \\"It would be a blessing should you choose not to save me, sparing Little Jin from the abuse at your hands.\\" Su Mingzhu couldn't help but scoff. She desired to torment Shi Jin, but with each attempt, she was the one left to suffer. Facing the nonchalant old lady, her words dripping with bitterness, \\"We shall see if you maintain this defiance in the face of disaster.\\" As she finished, she cast a contemptuous glare at Shi Jin, \\"I have words for you.\\" Shi Jin anticipated the subject was to be Zhang Yi's birthday celebration. Not wishing to worry the old lady, she summoned a bodyguard to watch over her, withdrawing with Su Mingzhu to the shade beneath a nearby tree. \\"Speak your piece, what business brings you to the hospital?\\" Certainly, Su Mingzhu would not reveal her true intentions; the thrill of an unexpected outburst was far more exhilarating. She flaunted an embossed invitation with a smug expectancy. \\"This comes from Director Zhang, who wishes your attendance tomorrow at seven o'clock. Dress to impress, charm him well, did you hear?\\" If Zhang was satisfied with the evening, the Su family's peril might be averted. Once Zhang wedded Shi Jin, they could ascend into high society! Shi Jin's gaze cut through Su Mingzhu's transparent emotions as she snatched the invitation and struck Su Mingzhu's face in the same swift motion. A resonant slap followed, causing Su Mingzhu's delicate cheeks to swell visibly. Bending down, Shi Jin whispered venomously, \\"Have you not learned from the bar incident? Had I not contacted the police, how might your fate have differed, shall I remind you?\\" The raid was timely; Su Mingzhu and Gu Yuheng had not yet committed acts untoward. Regarding scandal... Thanks to a mix-up with the drinks, Su Mingzhu became the inadvertent victim rather than scandal center, garnering sympathy and flipping the narrative in her favor. All because Shi Jin had chosen to step back. \\"Su Mingzhu, provoke me no further, or the image you painstakingly salvaged shall be summarily demolished.\\" With these words, she straightened, invitation in hand, and left. The reeling Su Mingzhu regained her senses, gripping Shi Jin's wrist with eyes aflame with hatred. \\"Shi Jin, don't gloat, for soon you will be on your knees, begging me for mercy!\\""},{"prompt":"I am making a crossplatform c++ wxwidgets desktop app, and I got a problem on Windows, Linux works perfectly.

To fix this issue, you can modify your \`OnCombobox\` method as follows: \`\`\`cpp void Frame::OnCombobox(wxCommandEvent& event) { if (event.GetEventType() == wxEVT_COMMAND_COMBOBOX_SELECTED || event.GetEventType() == wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED) { if (GetCombobox()->FindString(GetCombobox()->GetValue()) != wxNOT_FOUND) { SetEdited(); } } event.Skip(); } \`\`\` In this modified version, we check if the selected text in the combobox is present in the list of available items.

In that case, you can keep track of whether the combobox has been manually edited by using a boolean flag.

When the combobox is selected or its text is updated, we check whether \`editedByUser\` is \`true\` or \`false\`. If it is \`true\`, it means the combobox has been manually edited, and we call the \`SetEdited\` method. If it is \`false\`, it means the user has just manually edited the combobox, so we set \`editedByUser\` to \`true\` to indicate that subsequent changes should be considered as manual edits.

Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In the sprawling complex of IKEA, situated in a suburban maze just as perplexing as one of its own furniture instruction manuals, four rather unusual new employees had been hired. They were an eclectic bunch, each from wildly different backgrounds, yet here they stood, donning the unmistakable yellow shirts and navy trousers that signified their roles as IKEA's latest customer service representatives. Isaac Clarke, formerly an engineer and survivor of the USG Ishimura disaster, found solace in the organized chaos of the furniture store. Quietly, he'd been applying his technical expertise to the construction of flat-pack furniture with a precision that matched his experience in repairing starship components. Agent 47, a master of disguise and execution, had sought a temporary hideout from his life of clandestine contracts. The anonymity of a crowded store allowed him to blend in perfectly with the masses, all while offering a peculiar form of meditation as he arranged LINNMON table tops and ADILS legs into their respective bins. Geese Howard, a feared crime lord from South Town, was here for entirely different reasons. He had ventured into the lawful side of business, exploring low-risk investments, and somehow, this had led him to owning a franchise of the Swedish furniture giant. Monitoring operations from the background, Geese saw himself as an overseer, ensuring profits were on the rise and his new empire expanded. Bowser, the King of the Koopas, notorious for his repeated attempts to usurp the Mushroom Kingdom, had been mysteriously transported to this human realm. While initially perplexed and enraged by his new, mundane circumstances, he had found a sense of achievement in the task of organizing the children's section, SMÅSTADs and FLISATs becoming his new castles and subjects. On one seemingly ordinary day, the store was buzzing with the usual cacophony of families and couples perusing through the maze of showrooms and market halls, but our four protagonists found themselves called into the staff room by their store manager, Ingrid. \\"Team,\\" Ingrid began, her eyes sweeping over her motley crew, \\"We're facing a busy weekend ahead. I need all hands on deck. The new HEMNES series has just arrived, and we need to set up the displays by tomorrow morning.\\" Isaac nodded, already mentally mapping out the most efficient workflow. Agent 47 maintained his usual unreadable expression, calculating the task as if it were a mission briefing. Bowser grumbled under his breath, not quite fancying the manual labor, while Geese simply raised an eyebrow, his arms crossed. \\"Don't worry, Ingrid,\\" Isaac said. \\"We've got this covered. Right, team?\\" \\"Heh,\\" Geese smirked. \\"Of course, Clarke. What's a bunch of furniture to people like us?\\" Ingrid left the room, and the four got to work. Isaac and Agent 47 made a beeline for the flat-pack storage, Bowser lumbered towards the children's section with a grunt, and Geese decided to oversee the operations from a comfortable HATTEFJÄLL swivel chair. \\"Okay, Clarke,\\" Agent 47 addressed Isaac in his earpiece, \\"I've spotted the HEMNES packages. I'm proceeding with the retrieval.\\" Isaac chuckled. \\"Roger that, 47. I'll prep the assembly area. And please, call me Isaac.\\" As 47 wheeled over the packages with expert stealth, avoiding the gaze of curious shoppers, Isaac began laying out the parts methodically, fitting each dowel and screw into its place with robotic precision. Bowser, meanwhile, found himself becoming protective of the children's section. A smile crept across his scaly face as he set up a new display, his large hands surprisingly adept at piecing together the colorful furniture. \\"You seem to be enjoying this, King Koopa,\\" Geese commented as he strolled by, observing Bowser's work. Bowser let out a low chuckle. \\"I guess it's... not so bad. Kids need castles to conquer, after all.\\" The day wore on, and the team worked harmoniously, despite their disparate backgrounds. Isaac and Agent 47 had transformed the flat-pack mess into a series of beautiful displays, their HEMNES dressers and bookcases standing proudly for the coming onslaught of weekend customers. As evening approached and the store began to quiet down, Ingrid returned, her eyes widening in admiration. \\"This... this is incredible work, you four. I can't believe you got it all done so quickly!\\" Geese stepped forward, adjusting his tie. \\"Ingrid, you give us the tools and we give you the results. We may just be four guys from different worlds, but when it comes to tackling IKEA furniture, we're the best assembly team you've got.\\" Isaac, Agent 47, Bowser, and Geese shared a rare moment of camaraderie, realizing that despite everything, teamwork had brought them together in the most unexpected of places. They had survived space horrors, underworld dealings, countless adversaries, and even multiverse travels, but it was IKEA that had truly tested their mettle. And as they clocked out for the day, passing by the rows of BILLY bookcases and POÄNG chairs, they each couldn't help but feel a peculiar sense of home amid the labyrinth of Swedish design. Indeed, for these four renowned individuals, IKEA had become the most unlikely battleground and an even more unlikely place of unity."},{"prompt":".

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, не веря себе, я сама побежала к своей похитительнице, попросив её помочь мне завести машину Она с удовольствием помогла мне, но с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Ты думаешь, что сможешь сбежать от меня так легко? Нет, теперь ты принадлежишь мне.” став меня неожиданно целовать, она усадила меня в свою машину и повезла к себе домой","completion":"И с каждой минутой, я понимала, что моя жизнь сменила свое направление.

Мысли о свободе и возвращении к нормальной жизни dayette Каждая попытка найти помощи, каждая просьба о помощи оказывались безуспешными – она всегда находила меня и отводила обратно. Моя надежда на спасение начала медленно угасать, и я чувствовала, что с каждым днем все глубже погружаюсь во тьму. Психическое и физическое истощение охватывали меня, и я не знала, как долго мне еще придется выносить это адское существование. Но однажды, каким-то чудом, я нашла маленькую щель в ее контроле надо мной. Было ночью, она уснула, и я тихонько выскользнула из комнаты. Мое сердце билось так сильно, что я даже боялась, что она его услышит. Я понимала, что у меня есть только один шанс на спасение. Моя решимость была непоколебима. Бежать, бежать так быстро, насколько только смогу. Не оглядываться, не останавливаться. Не смотря на слабость и усталость, я брала все свои оставшиеся силы и продолжала идти. Мне казалось, что это будет борьба неравных, но я знала, что моя жизнь зависит от этого. С каждым шагом я приближалась к свободе. Мое сердце радовалось, и надежда вновь оживала в моей душе.

The \`SetEdited()\` method will only be called if \`initialized\` is \`true\` and the event type indicates that the combobox was edited. The \`initialized\` flag is set to \`true\` after the first event is processed, preventing the method from being called when the combobox is initially loaded. By adding this check, the \`OnCombobox\` method should only be called when the combobox is manually edited by the user, and not when it is initially loaded on Windows.

Чтобы решить проблему, убедитесь в следующем: 1. **Установка Emgu CV**: убедитесь, что библиотека Emgu CV правильно установлена в вашем проекте. Если вы используете NuGet для управления зависимостями, проверьте, что пакет \`Emgu.CV\` и его зависимости (например, \`Emgu.CV.runtime.windows\` если вы работаете на Windows) есть в списке установленных пакетов. 2. **Копирование нативных библиотек**: убедитесь, что все необходимые нативные DLL (например, 'cvextern.dll') скопированы в выходной каталог приложения при сборке. Некоторые пакеты NuGet автоматически настраивают проект на копирование этих файлов, но в некоторых случаях это может потребовать дополнительной настройки. 3. **Пути к библиотекам**: проверьте, что пути к нативным библиотекам прописаны в переменной среды PATH или актуальны в контексте работы приложения. Иногда необходимо поместить эти DLL в папку с исполняемым файлом приложения. 4. **Версии библиотек**: несоответствие версий Emgu CV и её нативных компонентов может вызывать ошибки. Убедитесь, что вы используете совместимые версии. 5. **Версии зависимостей**: 'cvextern.dll' может зависеть от других DLL, таких как нативные библиотеки OpenCV или другие библиотеки C++. Если они не установлены, 'cvextern.dll' не сможет загрузиться. Установите все необходимые компоненты. 6. **Правильная платформа**: убедитесь, что вы компилируете ваше приложение для правильной целевой платформы (x86 или x64), которая соответствует архитектуре нативных DLL. 7. **Повреждённые файлы**: возможно, файл 'cvextern.dll' или один из его зависимых файлов повреждён или неполный. Попробуйте переустановить Emgu CV и все связанные компоненты. Если проблему решить не удалось и вы уверены, что сделали всё правильно, попробуйте воспользоваться инструментами, такими как Dependency Walker, чтобы проверить, не требует ли 'cvextern.dll' каких-либо дополнительных библиотек, которые отсутствуют в вашей системе."},{"prompt":"Identify 2 fields within the header for each of the following PDUs that are included for addressing purposes PDU Layer Field 1 Field 2","completion":"PDU: Layer: Field 1: Field 2: 1.

It is a critical part of the virtual memory system in many operating systems, including Microsoft Windows. Here's how the pagefile works: 1. Virtual Memory: When the physical RAM on a computer is insufficient to handle all the running processes and programs, the operating system uses a portion of the hard drive (or SSD) to temporarily store data that would normally reside in RAM. 2. Swapping/Paging: The process of moving data between RAM and the pagefile is known as swapping or paging. When a process needs more memory, but the RAM is full, the operating system will move some of the less frequently accessed memory pages to the pagefile to free up RAM for more immediate needs. 3. Size and Location: The pagefile's size and location can often be customized. By default, it is managed by the operating system, which can adjust its size as needed. Users have the option to set manual limits or to place the pagefile on a specific drive for performance reasons. 4. Performance Impact: The use of a pagefile can impact system performance, as reading and writing to a hard disk or SSD is significantly slower than accessing physical RAM. However, having a pagefile prevents the system from running out of memory entirely, which would cause programs to fail or the entire system to crash. 5. Configuration: In Windows, the pagefile is typically named \`pagefile.sys\` and is hidden in the root directory of the drive where the operating system is installed. Users with administrative privileges can adjust settings related to the pagefile, such as its size or the drive it resides on, through the System Properties settings. 6. No Pagefile Systems: Some computers with large amounts of RAM might be configured to not use a pagefile at all, especially if performance is a key consideration and the likelihood of exhausting the available RAM is low. In summary, a pagefile is a mechanism that helps an operating system manage memory by providing additional virtual memory space to complement the physical RAM, ensuring that systems can continue to operate even when the demands for memory exceed the available RAM."},{"prompt":"where can you find it in windows?","completion":"In Windows, the pagefile is typically found on the system drive, which is usually the C: drive, and it is named \`pagefile.sys\`. It is a hidden system file, so it won't be visible through the regular File Explorer view unless you have configured your system to show protected operating system files. Here's how to locate the pagefile: 1. **Open File Explorer** by pressing Win+E on your keyboard, or by clicking on the folder icon on the taskbar. 2. **View Hidden Items**: You need to enable the viewing of hidden items. Go to the View tab on the File Explorer menu, and ensure the checkbox for \\"Hidden items\\" is checked. 3. **Show Protected Operating System Files** (optional, if not seeing \`pagefile.sys\`): By default, Windows hides certain protected system files. To see them, you need to further adjust the settings: - Click on \\"Options\\" or \\"Change folder and search options\\" on the View tab. - Go to the View tab in the Folder Options dialog. - Uncheck \\"Hide protected operating system files (Recommended).\\" - Confirm any prompts that warn you about displaying system files. 4. **Navigate to the Root of the System Drive**: Go to \\"This PC\\" and then open the C: drive or whichever drive contains your Windows installation. 5. **Find Pagefile.sys**: Within the root directory, look for the file named \`pagefile.sys\`. Remember that even with hidden and protected files shown, \`pagefile.sys\` will not be viewable if you're not logged in with administrative privileges. Also, manipulating or deleting the \`pagefile.sys\` file is not recommended, as it is crucial for your system's operation, especially if your system runs out of physical memory. To configure settings related to the pagefile, such as its size or the drive it resides on, you can follow these steps: 1.

Extended partitions can be thought of as a container within which you can create multiple logical drives (also known as logical partitions). Here's how extended partitions work: 1. **MBR Partition Scheme**: The MBR partitioning scheme only allows for up to four primary partitions on a single physical hard drive. If a user needs more than four partitions, then one of these primary partitions can be created as an extended partition. 2. **Extended Partition**: The extended partition itself does not hold data directly. Instead, it functions like a wrapper or a container that can hold multiple logical drives. 3. **Logical Drives**: Within an extended partition, you can create one or more logical drives. These logical drives are the partitions in which operating systems, applications, and files can be stored, just like on a primary partition. 4. **Flexibility**: Logical drives provide the flexibility to create more partitions than the MBR limit of four. There is no set limit to the number of logical drives that can exist within an extended partition, although the practical limit is often dictated by the operating system and the disk size. 5. **Partition Management**: When setting up a hard drive, typically, you would first create any primary partitions required, and then create an extended partition with the remaining unallocated space. Inside this extended partition, you can create logical drives as needed. 6. **Accessing Data**: From the operating system's perspective, logical drives in an extended partition are accessed and used just like primary partitions. They can be formatted with a file system, receive a drive letter, and be used to store files. It's important to note that the MBR partitioning scheme, including extended and logical partitions, has largely been replaced by the GUID Partition Table (GPT) in newer systems. GPT does not have the four-primary-partition limitation and allows for a much larger number of partitions (up to 128 partitions in Windows), without the need for an extended partition concept. Moreover, with the advent of GPT, many of the limitations associated with MBR and extended partitions have been resolved, making the management of disk partitions more straightforward and providing better support for larger hard drives."},{"prompt":"Using the laws of Boolean algebra, simplify the expression F = (AB + A’B’)’","completion":"To simplify the given Boolean expression F = (AB + A'B')', we can apply De Morgan's Theorem and the Law of Complementation.

This representation technique designates one bit to represent the sign of the number and the remaining bits to represent the magnitude (absolute value) of the number. Here is how the sign and magnitude representation is structured: 1. **Sign bit**: The most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit. A value of 0 typically indicates a positive number (or zero), and a value of 1 indicates a negative number. 2. **Magnitude bits**: The bits that follow represent the magnitude of the number in binary form, just as they would in an unsigned binary number. For example, in an 8-bit sign and magnitude system: - The positive number +5 would be \`00000101\` (0 as the sign bit indicating positive, followed by the binary representation of 5 which is 101). - The negative number -5 would be \`10000101\` (1 as the sign bit indicating negative, followed by the same binary representation of 5). One of the characteristics of sign and magnitude representation is that it creates two representations for zero: positive zero (\`00000000\`) and negative zero (\`10000000\`). This is considered one of the drawbacks of the sign and magnitude form, and why other representations like two's complement are more commonly used in computer systems, which provide a unique representation for zero and are more efficient for arithmetic operations.

Прежде чем добавить скрипт, убедитесь, что у вашей платформы есть компонент Collider (например, \`BoxCollider2D\`), который будет использоваться для определения столкновений с линиями. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class PlatformMover : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject platform; // Платформа для перемещения public Collider2D boundsCollider; // Коллайдер границ private Camera mainCamera; private bool isDragging = false; private void Start() { // Получаем ссылку на основную камеру mainCamera = Camera.main; } private void Update() { // Проверяем, если нажата кнопка мыши if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { // Переводим позицию курсора в мировые координаты Vector2 mousePos = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition); // Проверяем, попал ли курсор в коллайдер платформы if (platform.GetComponent<Collider2D>() == Physics2D.OverlapPoint(mousePos)) { isDragging = true; } } // Когда кнопка мыши отпущена, прекращаем перетаскивание if (Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0)) { isDragging = false; } // Если перетаскивание идет, двигаем платформу if (isDragging) { Vector2 mousePos = mainCamera.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition); MovePlatform(mousePos); } } private void MovePlatform(Vector2 position) { // Обновляем позицию платформы, если она в пределах границ // Создаём Raycast для проверки столкновения с границами RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast(position, Vector2.zero); // Двигаем платформу только если Raycast не засекает коллайдер границ if (!hit.collider || hit.collider == boundsCollider) { platform.transform.position = position; } } } \`\`\` Чтобы данный скрипт заработал: 1. Добавьте его на любой активный объект в сцене Unity. 2. Перетащите ваш объект платформы в поле \`Platform\` в инспекторе. 3. Перетащите объект линии, который будет ограничивать движение платформы в поле \`Bounds Collider\` в инспекторе. Обратите внимание, что для отладки и корректной работы следует подстроить данную логику под ваш конкретный случай, поскольку размеры коллайдеров, настройки физики и другие аспекты вашей игры могут повлиять на то, как должен работать данный скрипт. Вы можете настроить слои (Layers) и маски столкновений (Collision Masks), чтобы Raycast внутри \`MovePlatform\` функции проверял только столкновения с нужными объектами."},{"prompt":"Придумай комментарий к статье которую ты прочитал с названием: - \\"Петра Порошенко не пропустили через границу.

What is the expected number of calls in one hour? What is the probability of three calls in five minutes? What is the probability of no call in a five minute period?","completion":"To find the expected number of calls in one hour, we can first determine the rate of calls per minute, and then multiply that by the number of minutes in an hour. Number of calls per minute = 1 call every 2 minutes = 1/2 calls per minute Number of minutes in an hour = 60 minutes Expected number of calls in one hour = (1/2 calls per minute) * (60 minutes per hour) = 30 calls To find the probability of three calls in five minutes, we need to consider a Poisson distribution, as the arrival of calls can be considered a Poisson process. The formula for the probability of k events in a certain time interval is given by: P(k events in time interval) = (e^(-λ) * λ^k) / k!, where λ is the average rate of events in the given time interval. In this case, λ = 1 call every 2 minutes = 1/2 calls per minute. Therefore, the average rate of calls in a five-minute period is λ = (1/2 calls per minute) * (5 minutes) = 5/2 = 2.5 calls. P(3 calls in 5 minutes) = (e^(-2.5) * (2.5^3)) / 3!

If the average time before a repair is required is 300 days, what proportion of TVs can a new TV dealer expect back within the 90 days warranty period. Assume that the time to repair follow an exponential distribution.","completion":"To find the proportion of TVs that the dealer can expect back within the 90-day warranty period, we can use the exponential distribution. The parameter λ in the exponential distribution represents the rate at which repairs are required. In this case, the average time before a repair is required is 300 days, so the rate λ is equal to 1/300 repairs per day. To find the proportion of TVs returned within the 90-day period, we need to calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution up to 90 days. The CDF gives the probability that a repair occurs within a certain time interval. The CDF of the exponential distribution is given by: CDF(x) = 1 - e^(-λx) where x represents the time interval. Plugging in the values, we have: CDF(90 days) = 1 - e^(-(1/300)(90)). Therefore, the proportion of TVs that the dealer can expect back within the 90-day warranty period is CDF(90 days)."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней.

Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, свернув на обочину у меня заглохла машина, не веря себе, я сама побежала к своей похитительнице, попросив её помочь мне завести машину Она с удовольствием помогла мне, но с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Ты думаешь, что сможешь сбежать от меня так легко? Нет, теперь ты принадлежишь мне.” став меня неожиданно целовать, она усадила меня в свою машину и не сказав нечего дала мне выпить любовный напиток","completion":"из флакона, который она держала в руке.

Мои мысли были запутанными и размытыми. Я не могла определить, что происходит вокруг меня и где нахожусь. Время казалось замедленным, и все, что делала, было смутным и необдуманным. Но в глубине сердца я сохраняла надежду на освобождение. В одном из моментов я осознала, что моя похитительница оставила меня одну на некоторое время. Воспользовавшись этим редким шансом, я начала исследовать окружающую местность. Было ночное время, и все вокруг было в полной темноте. Я двигалась бесшумно и осторожно, стараясь не привлекать внимания. Мои ноги вели меня в направлении убежища, которое я надеялась найти. Через некоторое время я наткнулась на старое заброшенное строение. Оно казалось безопасным и уединенным, и я решила попытать счастья. Осторожно проникнув внутрь, я нашла укромное место и спряталась там. Я прижала руки к груди, пытаясь успокоить дрожащее тело. Мои мысли были запутанными и настороженными, но я не собиралась сдаваться. Утро наступило, и я решила продолжить свое путешествие в поисках освобождения. Хоть я и была слаба и обессиленна, но решимость привела меня вперед. Я продолжала бродить по окрестностям, надеясь найти провод, который сможет вывести меня из этой кошмарной ситуации.

Some commonly used models in classification tasks like this include: 1. Logistic Regression: A linear model that predicts the probability of an outcome based on weighted input features. 2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes of data. 3. Gradient Boosting Classifiers (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): Ensemble models that combine multiple weak classifiers to create a strong predictive model. 4. Neural Networks: Deep learning models with multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) capable of learning complex patterns. 5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple model that classifies data based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors. 6. Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that applies Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between the features. It's important to note that the choice of the model depends on several factors, including the size and quality of the dataset, desired interpretability, computational resources, and specific characteristics of the problem at hand. Experimenting with different models and selecting the one that performs the best through proper evaluation techniques like cross-validation is usually recommended. You can try different models with the given input data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine which model works best for your specific use case."},{"prompt":"I want to train model based on actual race results.

Here are a few ways you can handle disqualifications or any other incorrect information in the training set: 1. Remove Disqualified Instances: If there are specific instances in your dataset where drivers were disqualified, you can remove those instances from the training set entirely. You can identify disqualified instances based on a specific value or flag that indicates disqualification. 2. Handle Missing Data Appropriately: Disqualifications might result in missing data for certain features or target variables. You can handle missing data by imputing values using various techniques, such as filling missing values with the mean or median lap times for that specific driver or circuit. 3. Adjust Target Values: If a driver was disqualified, you can assign a special value or class to represent the disqualification in the target variable. For example, you could assign -1 or \\"DQ\\" to indicate disqualification instead of using a specific rank or place. 4. Separate DQ Instances for Separate Analysis: If you have sufficient information available regarding the reasons for disqualifications, you can create a separate analysis for disqualified instances. This can help identify patterns or identify causes leading to disqualifications. It's crucial to carefully analyze the specific circumstances and the nature of disqualifications to decide on the appropriate approach for handling such instances. Additionally, ensure that you have reliable and accurate data sources for training your model to minimize the presence of incorrect information in the first place."},{"prompt":"In some situations, for example: practice session is in good weather, but qualifications are during the rain, so difference between best lap might be like 20 seconds. What should I do with it?","completion":"In cases where there is a significant difference in lap times between practice sessions in good weather and qualifying sessions in rainy conditions (such as a 20-second difference), you may need to carefully consider how to handle this discrepancy in your data preprocessing and modeling. Here are a few possible approaches: 1. Normalize Lap Times: One option is to normalize the lap times based on weather conditions or other relevant factors. For example, you could calculate the lap time difference between the driver's best lap in qualifying and their average lap time in practice. This way, you can account for the variability in lap times due to weather conditions and focus more on the relative performance of drivers. 2. Feature Engineering: Instead of using absolute lap times, you can create additional features that capture relevant information. For example, you could calculate the difference between a driver's best lap time in qualifying and their best lap time in practice, or the percentage change in lap time from practice to qualifying. These engineered features can help your model learn the relationship between different weather conditions and lap time differences. 3. Separate Models: If the weather conditions have a significant impact on lap times, you can consider building separate models for different weather conditions. This way, you can train a model specifically for good weather conditions and another model for rainy conditions. You can then make predictions using the appropriate model based on the current weather conditions on race day. 4. Data Filtering: Another option is to filter the data based on specific weather conditions. You can choose to include only the race results where there were similar weather conditions between practice and qualifying. This can help ensure that the lap times used for training and predictions are more consistent and comparable. Ultimately, the approach you choose will depend on the specifics of your data and the problem you are trying to solve. It may be useful to analyze the impact of weather conditions on lap times and experiment with different strategies to find the most effective approach for your particular case."},{"prompt":"Suggest model to predict best race strategy for pit-stops (changing tyres)","completion":"To predict the best race strategy for pit-stops, including the timing and type of tire changes, you can use time series forecasting models or reinforcement learning techniques. Here are two possible approaches to consider: 1. Time Series Forecasting: You can treat the problem as a time series forecasting task, where you predict the optimal pit-stop strategy based on historical race data and current race conditions. In this case, you can use models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Prophet, a forecasting tool developed by Facebook. - ARIMA: ARIMA models can capture patterns and trends in the historical data to forecast the optimal timing and type of tire changes. - LSTM: LSTM networks are effective in capturing long-term dependencies in time series data. By training an LSTM model on historical race data, you can predict the optimal pit-stop strategy based on current race conditions. - Prophet: Prophet is a robust forecasting tool that can handle various types of time series data. It allows you to incorporate additional factors such as weather conditions, track information, and driver performance to predict the best pit-stop strategy. 2. Reinforcement Learning: Another approach is to use reinforcement learning techniques to learn the optimal pit-stop strategy through trial and error. - Q-Learning: Q-Learning is one of the commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms. By defining states (current race conditions), actions (pit-stop timing and tire changes), and rewards (race performance improvement), an agent can learn the best strategy over time. - Deep Q-Network (DQN): DQN is an extension of Q-Learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-values. This approach can handle complex and high-dimensional state spaces and provide more accurate predictions for pit-stop strategies. Both approaches have their merits and trade-offs. Time series forecasting models are suitable if you have comprehensive historical data and want to predict the best strategy based on patterns and trends.

Aquí te explico las diferencias entre el \\"Supply Máximo\\" (Max Supply) y el \\"Supply Total\\" (Total Supply): 1. **Supply Máximo (Max Supply):** - El Supply Máximo se refiere a la cantidad máxima de monedas o tokens que se crearán o podrán existir para una criptomoneda determinada. Esta es una cifra fija que se define en el momento de la creación de la criptomoneda y está codificada en su protocolo. - El Supply Máximo es importante porque establece un límite en la cantidad total de monedas que estarán en circulación, lo cual puede afectar a la percepción del valor debido a la escasez. Bitcoin, por ejemplo, tiene un Supply Máximo de 21 millones de monedas, lo que significa que nunca existirán más de 21 millones de bitcoins. - No todas las criptomonedas tienen un Supply Máximo predeterminado. Algunas, como Ethereum, no tienen un límite superior absoluto a su oferta total, aunque su emisión está regulada por otras políticas monetarias. 2. **Supply Total (Total Supply):** - El Supply Total es la cantidad de monedas o tokens que ya han sido minados o creados, menos cualquier moneda que haya sido verificadamente quemada o destruida (por ejemplo, a través de un proceso llamado \\"coin burn\\"). - A diferencia del Supply Máximo, el Supply Total cambia con el tiempo a medida que se crean nuevas monedas, generalmente a través de procesos como la minería o la forja, según las reglas de la red de la criptomoneda. - El Supply Total puede moverse hacia el Supply Máximo, pero nunca lo excederá. Si una criptomoneda tiene un Supply Máximo determinado, el Supply Total eventualmente se acercará a ese máximo a medida que la red continúe mintiendo nuevas monedas hasta alcanzarlo. En resumen, el Supply Máximo es la cantidad fija y teórica de monedas que eventualmente existirán para una criptomoneda en particular, mientras que el Supply Total es la cantidad de monedas que existen actualmente y que están en varios grados de circulación o usabilidad, excluyendo cualquier moneda quemada o eliminada."},{"prompt":"Pero el 2, no se parece al Supply circulante? estoy confundido","completion":"Entiendo la confusión. Vamos a aclararlo.

Se calcula restando de la oferta total las monedas que están reservadas o bloqueadas (por ejemplo, aquellas que están retenidas por los fundadores, equipos o en billeteras de \\"cold storage\\" y que no están disponibles para la compra/venta en el mercado). En ocasiones, el Supply Total y el Supply Circulante pueden ser parecidos en número, en especial si la criptomoneda tiene una política de poco o nulo bloqueo de monedas para los creadores/proyectos o poca cantidad de sus fondos en reserva. Sin embargo, pueden haber diferencias significativas si una gran porción del Supply Total está retenido y no está disponible para ser comercializado. Por lo tanto: - **Supply Máximo:** Número fijo de monedas que existirán, como máximo, en toda la vida de la criptomoneda. - **Supply Total:** Número de monedas que han sido minadas menos las destruidas, sin importar si están o no disponibles para el comercio. - **Supply Circulante:** Las monedas disponibles actualmente para los traders y el público general, que están en el mercado y que no están bloqueadas o retenidas por entidades centrales o contratos inteligentes.

The pronunciation of \\"Ba'al\\" in English typically follows the pattern of \\"Bahl\\" or \\"Bay-ahl,\\" with a slight emphasis on the first syllable: - \\"Bahl\\" is closer to a single syllable, with the 'a' as in \\"father\\" and slightly elongated due to the following 'al' sound. - \\"Bay-ahl\\" puts a little break between the two syllables, with the first syllable sounding like the word \\"bay\\" and the second like the word \\"all,\\" just pronounced quickly together. In Hebrew and other Semitic languages, the \\"Ba'al\\" pronunciation could be different due to the presence of the Ayin (ע) at the end of the word, which is a consonant not found in English and is often represented in English transliterations with an apostrophe following the \\"a\\" to indicate a guttural stop.

Additionally, students should analyze the limitations and potential biases of the study, such as sample selection bias or researcher bias, to understand the scope and potential impact of the recommendations. By thoroughly examining these issues, students can make informed judgments about the applicability and potential implications of the research study's recommendations. Reference: Leedy, P.

Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения.

Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией.

Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает.

Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома.

Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности.

Время текло медленно, и мне казалось, что никогда не настанет конец этой кошмарной ситуации. Но я отказывалась сдаваться.

It is the primary function of legislative bodies such as parliaments, congresses, or assemblies. The concept of lawmaking involves several key elements: 1. Legislation: The process begins with the creation of a proposed law, also known as a bill. This can be initiated by members of the legislature, government officials, interest groups, or citizens. 2. Introduction: Once the bill is drafted, it is introduced in the legislative body. This involves presenting it to the members, indicating its purpose and objectives. 3. Committee Review: The bill is then referred to a committee or committees that specialize in the subject matter of the proposed law. These committees review and analyze the bill, holding hearings, gathering information, and considering input from experts, stakeholders, and the public. 4. Debate: After the committee review, the bill is brought to the floor of the legislative body for debate. Members discuss its merits, potential impacts, and express their views and concerns. Amendments may be proposed and voted upon during this stage. 5. Voting: Once all concerns are addressed, the bill is put to a vote. The members of the legislative body vote either to pass the bill, reject it, or send it back for further revisions. 6. Approval: If the bill garners the majority of votes, it is approved and becomes law. In some jurisdictions, it may require additional steps like approval by another legislative body or the executive branch. 7. Implementation and Enforcement: After approval, the law enters into force. It is the responsibility of the executive branch, law enforcement agencies, and relevant authorities to ensure the law's effective implementation and enforcement. 8. Monitoring and Amendments: Laws are continuously monitored to evaluate their effectiveness and address any unintended consequences or needed changes. If necessary, amendments or revisions may be proposed and initiated through the lawmaking process. The concept of lawmaking is a fundamental aspect of democratic governance as it allows for the creation and modification of rules that shape society, protect individual rights, and promote the public welfare. The process is designed to incorporate diverse perspectives, promote transparency, and ensure accountability in the formulation of laws."},{"prompt":"Interpret legislation.","completion":"To interpret legislation means to analyze and understand the meaning and intent of a law. Legislation is often written in legal language and can be complex, so interpretation is necessary to determine how the law should be applied in specific situations. It involves examining the text of the law, considering the legislative history, and applying relevant principles of statutory interpretation. In interpreting legislation, several approaches and principles are commonly used: 1. Textual Interpretation: This approach focuses on the plain language of the law, giving words their ordinary meaning. Courts often start with the text of the statute and seek to give effect to its clear and unambiguous language. 2. Legislative Intent: The purpose or intent behind a law is an important consideration in interpretation. This involves examining the legislative history, including committee reports, debates, and statements made by lawmakers, to understand the problem the law intended to address and its goals. 3. Contextual Interpretation: The context in which a law was enacted and the overall legal framework within which it sits can inform its interpretation. Other related laws, regulations, and judicial decisions may provide guidance in understanding the meaning and scope of the legislation. 4. Presumption of Legality: Courts generally presume that legislation is valid, and it is their role to interpret it in a manner that upholds its constitutionality. They seek to avoid interpretations that would render the law unconstitutional or in conflict with other legal principles. 5. Purpose-Based Interpretation: Courts may look beyond the literal text of the law and consider its underlying purposes and policy objectives. This can involve analyzing the broader goals of the legislation and interpreting it in a manner that advances those objectives. 6. Precedent: Judicial decisions in previous cases that have interpreted similar laws or legal principles can guide the interpretation of new legislation. Courts often rely on established case law to ensure consistency and predictability in legal interpretation. Interpreting legislation is primarily the responsibility of courts, but it can also be undertaken by government officials, lawyers, and individuals who need to apply the law in different contexts. The aim of interpretation is to give effect to the legislative intent while also ensuring fairness, consistency, and adherence to the rule of law."},{"prompt":"Qué responder cuando en una entrevista de trabajo me preguntan, cuánto quiero ganar. Qué debo responder?","completion":"Cuando te preguntan cuánto quieres ganar en una entrevista de trabajo, es importante ser cauteloso y estratégico al responder. Aquí hay algunas sugerencias sobre cómo abordar esta situación: 1. Investiga el salario promedio: Realiza una investigación previa sobre los salarios promedio para el puesto que estás solicitando en tu ubicación geográfica. Esto te permitirá tener una idea realista de cuánto podrías esperar ganar. 2. Menciona tu rango salarial en lugar de un número específico: En lugar de dar una cifra única, puedes responder indicando un rango salarial que refleje tus expectativas. Por ejemplo, podrías mencionar que, según tu investigación, el rango salarial para ese puesto es de X a Y, y que estarías buscando que tu salario se encuentre dentro de esa franja. 3. Destaca tus habilidades y experiencia: En lugar de enfocarte únicamente en el aspecto monetario, puedes resaltar tus habilidades y experiencia que demuestran el valor que aportarías a la organización. Esto permite al entrevistador ver qué puedes ofrecer más allá del salario, lo cual podría ser un factor importante al negociar tu compensación. 4. Sé flexible: Si bien es importante tener una idea clara de tus expectativas salariales, también es recomendable mostrar cierta flexibilidad. Dejar en claro que estás abierto a discutir el salario y otros aspectos de la oferta puede ayudar a establecer una base para futuras negociaciones. 5. Pregunta acerca de los beneficios y oportunidades de crecimiento: Mientras discutes el salario, también puedes aprovechar para preguntar acerca de los beneficios adicionales que ofrece la empresa, como planes de seguro médico, planes de retiro, programas de desarrollo profesional, etc. Esto demuestra que estás interesado en el paquete completo de compensación y no sólo en el salario base. Recuerda que, en última instancia, la decisión sobre la oferta salarial es un proceso de negociación en el que ambas partes deben sentirse satisfechas.

Так как AB=BC и точка D является серединой AB, то DE также является высотой, биссектрисой и медианой равнобедренного треугольника ABC. Это означает, что она делит угол B пополам и BC на две равные части, то есть BE=EC. Пусть x — длина стороны AC (которую мы хотим найти), а также BE=EC, так как DE — медиана. Теперь, раз периметр треугольника AEC равен 27 см, запишем это как уравнение, учитывая длины сторон: AE + EC + AC = 27 см Заметим, что AE = AD, так как D — середина AB и DE — высота в равнобедренном треугольнике. Длина AD равна половине AB (AD=AB/2=18 см/2=9 см). Тогда AE = 9 см. Подставим AE и EC (EC = x/2, потому что BE=EC, и BC является отрезком AC) в уравнение: 9 см + x/2 + x = 27 см Теперь решим уравнение: x/2 + x = 27 см - 9 см 1.5x = 18 см x = 18 см / 1.5 x = 12 см Таким образом, длина стороны AC равна 12 см."},{"prompt":"Another process pattern is the level of confidence in handling the new, multiple, and sometimes conflicting demands on a person, family, or organization in the midst of attempting to deal with a triggering event.

It consists of four key elements: product, price, place, and promotion. 1. Product: This refers to the tangible or intangible goods and services offered by a company to meet the needs and wants of the target market. It includes features, design, quality, packaging, branding, and any additional services provided to enhance customer satisfaction. 2. Price: The price of a product is the amount customers are willing to pay in exchange for the value they perceive from the product. Factors such as production costs, competition, demand, and market positioning are taken into account when determining the pricing strategy. The pricing strategy may include strategies like penetration pricing (setting a low price to enter a market), skimming pricing (setting a high price to capture premium customers), or value pricing (offering a product at a moderate price based on its perceived value). 3. Place: This refers to the channels or distribution outlets through which a product is made available to the target customers. It involves decisions regarding the location, availability, and convenience of purchasing the product. Distribution channels can be direct, where the product is sold directly to the customer, or indirect, where intermediaries like retailers or wholesalers are involved. 4. Promotion: Promotional activities aim to create awareness, generate interest, and persuade customers to purchase a product. It includes advertising, sales promotions, public relations, personal selling, and direct marketing. The goal is to communicate the value of the product, create brand equity, and ultimately drive sales. The promotion mix may vary depending on the target audience, budget, and overall marketing objectives. The marketing mix elements are interrelated and need to be coordinated to ensure a coherent marketing strategy. A balance between them is necessary to effectively reach the target market, satisfy customer needs, and achieve the organization's goals. The 4Ps framework is commonly used but has evolved over time to include additional elements such as people, process, and physical evidence, particularly in the service industry."},{"prompt":"Придумай комментарий к статье которую ты прочитал с названием: - \\"Несмотря на усилия Буданова и адвоката, прокурор возразил против ходатайства, сославшись на предыдущее решение суда от 2 ноября 2023 года, в котором уже рассматривались эти обстоятельства.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, я попыталась ускориться. но она в меня врезалась, и я потеряла сознание, она тут-же подбежала ко мне взяв меня на руки","completion":"и унесла в свою машину. Когда я пришла в себя, оказалась в незнакомом месте, привязанной к стулу. Она стояла передо мной, смотря своими искаженными глазами. Она улыбалась, наслаждаясь моим страхом. Она начала говорить, выплескивая свою боль и ярость. Она рассказала мне историю своей жизни, полную травм и разочарований. Она была одинока, отвергнута обществом и мечтала о том, чтобы кто-то ее полюбил. Но все ее попытки были безуспешными. Медсестра была ее последней надеждой на любовь и счастье. И когда я явилась в поликлинику, она видела во мне новую возможность. Она решила, что я была тем, кто смог бы принести ей любовь и радость. Но когда я ушла из поликлиники и она увидела меня с другой женщиной, ее разочарование и отчаяние перерастили в ярость. Она похитила меня, чтобы не потерять меня и принудить меня полюбить ее. Слушая ее историю, я почувствовала сочувствие. Я понимала, что она делала все это из отчаяния и желания быть любимой. Но я также понимала, что я не могу быть той, кого она искала. Я была свободной и моим сердцем принадлежало уже другому. Я начала говорить с ней, пытаясь проникнуть в ее сердце. Я рассказала ей о том, что каждый человек заслуживает любви и счастья, но это не может быть принудительным. Я убедила ее, что ей нужно отпустить меня и искать свое счастье внутри себя. Наконец, она сдалась. Она отвязала меня и отпустила. Мы простили друг друга и я покинула это место, чувствуя смешение страха и сострадания. Этот кошмар оставил во мне глубокий след. Я поняла, что каждый из нас несет свою историю, свою боль. Иногда люди делают отчаянные вещи, чтобы найти счастье. Но мы должны помнить, что каждый заслуживает любви и сострадания, и что мы не можем диктовать судьбу других. И я поняла, что судьба наша сами коваем. Мы выбираем, как жить и как любить. И хотя вокруг нас всегда будет полно темноты и страха, мы можем найти свет и надежду.

It is named after Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot, the French physician who first described the condition. The four heart defects that make up the tetralogy of Fallot include: 1. Ventricular septal defect (VSD): This is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. It allows oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood to mix, leading to decreased oxygen supply to the body. 2. Pulmonary stenosis: The pulmonary valve, which controls blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, is narrowed or obstructed in this condition. This obstruction reduces blood flow to the lungs, causing the right ventricle to work harder to pump blood. 3. Right ventricular hypertrophy: The increased workload placed on the right ventricle due to the narrowed pulmonary valve causes the ventricle to thicken and enlarge. This is known as right ventricular hypertrophy. 4. Overriding aorta: In a normal heart, the aorta, which carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, arises from the left ventricle. In tetralogy of Fallot, the aorta partially overrides the ventricular septal defect and receives blood from both ventricles. This leads to mixing of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood. These four defects together result in reduced oxygenation of the blood that is pumped to the body. As a result, affected individuals may experience symptoms like cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), rapid breathing, fatigue, and poor growth. The severity of symptoms can vary, and surgical intervention is needed to correct the defects. The primary treatment for tetralogy of Fallot is open-heart surgery, often performed in infancy or early childhood, to repair the defects. This helps improve blood flow and oxygenation, and most individuals with repaired tetralogy of Fallot can lead normal lives with regular medical follow-up."},{"prompt":"как на C# с помощью Emgu сделать чтобы программа при нажатии кнопки вызывала часть кода /debug/scripts/getprice.cs сам файл находится в /debug/Form1.cs .

Développe","completion":"La zététique, souvent appelée l'art du doute, est une démarche intellectuelle qui vise à développer une attitude de questionnement et de réflexion critique vis-à-vis des connaissances, des faits et des croyances. Elle encourage une analyse rigoureuse des preuves et une recherche méthodique nécessaires pour soutenir ou réfuter une affirmation. Le terme \\"zététique\\" vient du grec \\"zetein\\", qui signifie \\"chercher\\" ou \\"examiner\\". Cette approche repose sur le scepticisme méthodologique : elle n'implique pas un rejet systématique des affirmations, mais elle invite plutôt à suspendre son jugement tant que les preuves et arguments suffisants n'ont pas été évalués. La zététique applique souvent la méthode scientifique pour examiner des affirmations particulières, en particulier celles qui relèvent de l'extraordinaire ou du paranormal. Par exemple, les zététiciens pourraient étudier des phénomènes tels que l'astrologie, la télépathie, ou les miracles, en utilisant des outils comme le raisonnement logique, l'analyse statistique, et la connaissance des mécanismes de perception et de cognition humaine. Les principes clés de la zététique incluent : 1. Le doute systématique : rester ouvert à la possibilité que notre compréhension actuelle puisse être erronée ou incomplète. 2. La recherche de preuves fiables : privilégier les données et les expériences réplicables et bien documentées. 3. L'analyse critique : examiner les affirmations de façon approfondie, en tenant compte des erreurs possibles, des biais, et des arguments fallacieux. 4. La proportionnalité de la conviction aux preuves : le degré de conviction doit être en corrélation directe avec la solidité des preuves à sa disposition. 5. La réfutabilité : une affirmation doit être formulée de façon à ce qu'elle puisse être, en principe, réfutée par de nouvelles preuves ou découvertes. La zététique se veut pragmatique et se concentre sur la probabilité et la plausibilité plutôt que sur la certitude absolue. Elle est enseignée dans certains cursus universitaires, particulièrement en France, où le mouvement zététique moderne a été popularisé par des personnalités comme le physicien Henri Broch ou l'astronome Michel Mayor. Au-delà de son application dans le domaine de l'examen des phénomènes extraordinaires, la zététique est également utile dans la vie quotidienne, pour développer l'esprit critique face à l'information, aux médias, à la politique et à la publicité. C’est un outil essentiel pour promouvoir la pensée scientifique et le scepticisme rationnel dans une société où l'information est abondante et pas toujours fiable."},{"prompt":"Donne un exemple simple pour illustrer l'argument de réfutabilité","completion":"L'argument de réfutabilité, ou falsifiabilité, est un concept central dans la philosophie des sciences proposé par Karl Popper. Un énoncé, une hypothèse ou une théorie est considérée comme scientifique si et seulement si elle peut être testée et potentiellement réfutée par des observations ou des expériences. Cela signifie qu'il doit exister une possibilité d'identifier une observation ou un résultat expérimental qui, s'il se réalisait, contredirait l'énoncé, l'hypothèse ou la théorie en question. Exemple simple : la théorie de la gravité. Selon la théorie de la gravité de Newton, si vous lâchez un objet quelconque près de la surface de la Terre, il tombera vers le sol en raison de la force gravitationnelle qui attire les objets l'un vers l'autre. Cette théorie est réfutable parce qu'elle propose une prédiction précise qui peut être testée. Pour la réfuter, il suffirait de montrer un exemple où, dans des conditions normales (sans l'intervention de forces extérieures comme le vent ou le magnétisme), un objet lâché ne tombe pas vers le sol. Si un tel événement était observé et vérifié, il remettrait en question la théorie de la gravité de Newton et forcerait les scientifiques à la revoir ou à chercher une explication plus adéquate. Heureusement pour la théorie de Newton, toutes les expériences faites à ce jour confirment que les objets lâchés tombent bien vers le sol sous l'effet de la gravité. Bien sûr, avec le développement ultérieur de la physique, la théorie de la gravité de Newton a été complétée et corrigée par la théorie de la relativité générale d'Einstein, qui offre une description plus précise de la gravité, particulièrement dans les conditions extrêmes (comme près d'un trou noir ou à des vitesses proches de celle de la lumière).

Скрипт позволяет перетаскивать платформу с помощью курсора мыши только по линиям, если нет стен, и не выходит за пределы линий.

Represent in such a register the following numbers in binary form: a. 12.25","completion":"To represent the number 12.25 in a 12-bit register with 8 bits for the fractional two's complement mantissa and 4 bits for the integer two's complement exponent, we need to follow these steps: 1. Convert the integer part to binary. 2. Convert the fraction to binary. 3. Normalize the binary scientific notation to fit the given register structure. 4. Determine and express the exponent in two's complement. 5. Determine the mantissa. 6. Combine the exponent and mantissa in the register. Let's go through these steps: # Convert the integer part to binary: The integer part is 12, which in binary is \`1100\`. # Convert the fraction to binary: To convert the fraction 0.25 to binary, we multiply by 2 and take note of the integer part at each step: 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 -> The integer part is 0. 0.5 * 2 = 1.0 -> The integer part is 1. So, the fraction 0.25 is \`01\` in binary. # Combine both parts: The binary representation of 12.25 is therefore \`1100.01\`. # Normalize the binary number: A normalized binary number has only one non-zero digit before the radix point. For 12.25, the normalized form would mean shifting the radix point two places to the left to get \`1.10001\`. To keep the value the same when we shift the radix point, we need to account for this by adjusting the exponent. # Determine the exponent: Since we shifted two places to the left, our exponent in decimal is \`2\`. To represent this in 4-bit two's complement, we simply convert the positive exponent to binary: \`2\` in decimal is \`10\` in binary. In a 4-bit binary representation, we just add zeroes in front: \`0010\`. # Determine the mantissa: After normalization, the mantissa is the part to the right of the radix point with an implicit leading 1 (which is not stored because in normalized form it's always 1). However, our 8-bit register for the mantissa includes the radix point, so we need to include it: The mantissa would be \`10001\`, but since we only have 8 bits, we pad it with zeroes to the right to fill the register: \`10001000\`. # Combine exponent and mantissa in the register: Now, we combine the 4-bit exponent with the 8-bit mantissa in the 12-bit register: Exponent: \`0010\` Mantissa: \`10001000\` Register: \`001010001000\` So, the number 12.25 in the specified 12-bit register format would be represented as \`001010001000\`."},{"prompt":"Hola","completion":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"prompt":"write a script for a meeting between spider-man with Blake Belladonna and amity blight","completion":"Title: Unexpected Allies - A Meeting of Heroes INT. AVENGERS TOWER - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY Peter Parker, aka SPIDER-MAN, nervously straightens his tie as he waits for his guests. Suddenly, the conference room door opens, revealing BLAKE BELLADONNA, an agile and silent huntress, and AMITY BLIGHT, a young witch with a fierce determination. PETER Hey! You must be Blake Belladonna and Amity Blight, right? Thanks for agreeing to meet with me. BLAKE (slightly wary) Yes, that's us. You sound nervous, Spider-Man. What exactly did you want to discuss? PETER (takes a breath) Well, recently, I found out that we have a lot in common. We all fight bad guys, and we've faced our own hardships. I thought it would be interesting to meet and see if we can learn from each other, maybe even help each other out. AMITY (raising an eyebrow) Hmm, interesting proposal. But what can someone like you learn from us? After all, we have different abilities and backgrounds. PETER (smiling) True, but that's precisely why I think we can benefit from this meeting. We all have unique talents, and sometimes, it's the differences that make a team stronger. Blake and Amity share a look, considering Peter's words. BLAKE (slightly intrigued) Alright, Peter. Let's hear how we can collaborate. Peter approaches a nearby whiteboard and starts drawing, depicting their abilities. PETER First, we have my web-slinging abilities, agility, and spidey-sense, which helps me dodge attacks. Then, Blake, your agility and cat-like reflexes, combined with your weapon of choice, the Gambol Shroud, which can slice and dice enemies. Lastly, Amity, your magical abilities like spellcasting and potions, have incredible potential for both healing and causing chaos. AMITY (skeptically) I still don't see how our abilities fit together or how our backgrounds align, Spider-Man. PETER Well, Blake, the Faunus people you come from face discrimination and hatred, just like some mutants in my world. Amity, you had to overcome your own fears and insecurities while proving yourself as a witch. It's all about finding strength through adversity. BLAKE (nods) I understand where you're coming from, Peter. Perhaps by combining our different experiences, we can better understand injustice and fight against it. AMITY (slightly smiling) Fine. I'm open to the idea of learning from others who have faced adversity as well. PETER (excited) Great! We can share our combat techniques, lend each other a hand during missions, and help protect those who can't protect themselves. Together, we can make a real difference. They all stand up, fists bumping together as a symbol of camaraderie. AMITY (chuckles) Seems like this unlikely alliance may have some potential after all. But remember, Spider-Man, no secrets. Trust is key. BLAKE (agrees) Agreed. Let honesty and trust guide us. PETER (smiling) Absolutely. Let's show them what we're made of! They exit the conference room, ready to forge a unique bond and become formidable allies in their shared mission to protect the innocent.

The command structure is using Discord.js and slash commands, with various subcommands like \`'create'\`, \`'delete'\`, \`'list'\`, \`'get'\`, and \`'cleardata'\`. The code reads configuration from a \`config.yml\` file, uses MongoDB models to interact with a database, and performs operations such as creating, deleting, and listing license keys. Below is the unobfuscated version of the initial part of the code with cleaner formatting and restored variable and function names: \`\`\`javascript const onceFunction = function () { let isFirstCall = true; return function (context, func) { const executeFunc = isFirstCall ? function () { if (func) { const result = func.apply(context, arguments); func = null; return result; } } : function () {}; isFirstCall = false; return executeFunc; }; }(); const wrappedFunction = onceFunction(this, function () { return wrappedFunction.toString().search('(((.+)+)+)+').toString().constructor(wrappedFunction).search('(((.+)+)+)+'); }); wrappedFunction(); \`\`\` Due to the excessive length and complexity of the script, I'll summarize the functionality of the command \`'license'\`: - \`create\`: Creates a new license key for a specified user and product. The command checks for proper permissions and also accepts an optional BuiltByBit user ID configuration. - \`delete\`: Deletes a specific license key. It logs the deletion to a webhook if configured and adjusts the total license count in the database. - \`list\`: Lists all existing license keys, paginating through the results and displaying detailed information about each license. - \`get\`: Retrieves information about a specific license key based on provided search criteria like license key, user ID, or BuiltByBit user ID. - \`cleardata\`: Clears specific data (IP or HWID) associated with a given license key, logging the action to a webhook if configured. The file references external components and models like \`SlashCommandBuilder\`, \`Discord\`, \`fs\`, \`yaml\`, \`productModel\`, \`licenseModel\`, \`statisticsModel\`, and \`utils\`. It is designed to be used with Node.js and Discord.js library as part of a Discord bot. The script also includes logic to log actions to a separate webhook and to manage permissions for different user roles. The code contains checks for permissions and developer mode, and uses embeds to provide a rich user interface when interacting with the Discord bot commands. It also demonstrates interaction with a MongoDB database to store and manage license data."},{"prompt":"En interrogeant un moteur de recherche du web, Jean tombe sur une photo de lui publiée sur le site de son ami Paul.

This enables them to approach critical problems with compassion and a genuine desire to find solutions that benefit everyone involved. 2) Resilience: Critical problems often require persistence and determination to overcome. Developing resilience as a habit of character allows individuals to face obstacles and setbacks without giving up. It helps them to stay focused on finding solutions and continue working towards a better community despite the challenges. 3) Collaboration: Solving critical problems in a community usually requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders. Developing a habit of collaboration means fostering open communication, actively seeking diverse perspectives, and working together towards a common goal. This habit helps to harness the collective skills, knowledge, and resources available within the community to find effective solutions. 4) Accountability: Taking responsibility for one's actions and their impact on the community is essential for solving critical problems. By developing a habit of accountability, individuals are more likely to actively contribute to finding solutions rather than being passive observers. This habit fosters a sense of ownership and encourages individuals to be proactive in their efforts to create positive change. 5) Adaptability: Critical problems often require innovative and flexible approaches. Developing the habit of adaptability allows individuals to think creatively, embrace change, and explore new possibilities. It enables individuals to adjust their perspectives and strategies as needed to address the ever-evolving challenges faced by the community. 6) Integrity: Trust is vital in building a strong and connected community. Developing the habit of integrity means acting honestly, ethically, and with respect for others. This habit builds credibility and fosters trust among community members, facilitating collaboration and enabling effective problem-solving. 7) Continuous Learning: Critical problems often demand new knowledge and skills to address them effectively. Developing a habit of continuous learning allows individuals to stay informed and acquire new expertise as needed. It enables individuals to adapt to changing circumstances, stay updated with the latest research and best practices, and contribute valuable insights and solutions to the community's challenges. By cultivating these habits of character, individuals can make significant contributions to solving critical problems and ultimately contribute to a better and more cohesive community."},{"prompt":"如何下载b站上的视频","completion":"要下载B站上的视频，可以使用第三方的在线工具或者下载软件来实现。以下是两种常用的方法： 1. 使用在线下载工具： - 打开B站官网，找到要下载的视频页面。 - 复制视频的链接地址。 - 在搜索引擎中搜索 \\"B站视频下载\\"，会出现多个在线下载工具网站，例如“Bilibili视频下载大师”、“B站助手”等。 - 进入一个合适的在线下载工具网站，把复制的视频链接粘贴进去。 - 点击下载按钮，等待下载完成。 2. 使用下载软件： - 在下载软件中搜索或复制B站视频的链接地址。 - 选择视频质量和保存位置。 - 点击下载按钮，等待下载完成。 无论是使用在线工具还是下载软件，都需要注意版权问题，合法使用下载内容，并遵守相关法律法规。"},{"prompt":"Tại một DN TM SX HẢI THÀNH hạch toán hàng tồn kho theo phương pháp KKTX, xuất kho theo phương pháp FiFo, tính thuế GTGT theo phương pháp khấu trừ, có tình hình về tiêu thụ hàng hóa M như sau (đơn vị tính: Đồng): I.

The perpendicular distance is given by the equation: perpendicular distance = length of the wrench * sin(angle) Given that the length of the wrench is 0.35 m and the angle is 30°, we can calculate the perpendicular distance: perpendicular distance = 0.35 m * sin(30°) Using the sine function, sin(30°) = 0.5, so the perpendicular distance is: perpendicular distance = 0.35 m * 0.5 = 0.175 m Finally, we can calculate the torque applied to the nut by multiplying the perpendicular distance by the magnitude of the applied force: torque = perpendicular distance * force = 0.175 m * 35 N Therefore, the torque applied to the nut is 6.125 N·m."},{"prompt":"Calculate the net torque about the point “O’ for the two forces, applied as shown in Figure.

Given that the spring constant is 250 N/m and the displacement of the spring is from 5 cm to 25 cm, we need to convert the displacement to meters: Displacement = 25 cm - 5 cm = 20 cm = 0.2 m Plugging the values into the equation: Elastic potential energy = (1/2) * 250 N/m * (0.2 m)^2 Simplifying the equation: Elastic potential energy = (1/2) * 250 N/m * 0.04 m^2 Calculating the value: Elastic potential energy = 2 J Therefore, the elastic potential energy stored in the spring when it is stretched from 5 cm to 25 cm is 2 J (Joules)."},{"prompt":"An ideal spring is hung vertically from the ceiling. When a 2.0 kg mass hangs at rest from it, the spring is extended 6.0 cm from its relaxed length. A downward external force is now applied to the mass to extend the spring an additional 10 cm. While the spring is being extended by the force, the work done by the spring is: (g = 9.8 m/s2 )","completion":"To calculate the work done by the spring while it is being extended by the force, we need to consider the change in potential energy of the spring. The potential energy stored in a spring (U) is given by the equation: U = (1/2) * k * x^2 where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. Given that the mass hanging from the spring is 2.0 kg and it is extended by 6.0 cm (0.06 m) from its relaxed length, we can calculate the spring constant: k = (m * g) / x where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Plugging in the values: k = (2.0 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) / 0.06 m Simplifying: k ≈ 3266.67 N/m Now, we can calculate the potential energy when the spring is extended by the external force. It is extended an additional 10 cm (0.1 m) from its previously extended position, resulting in a total displacement of 0.06 m + 0.1 m = 0.16 m. So, the work done by the spring is the change in potential energy: Work = U_final - U_initial U_initial = (1/2) * k * x_initial^2 = (1/2) * 3266.67 N/m * (0.06 m)^2 U_final = (1/2) * k * x_final^2 = (1/2) * 3266.67 N/m * (0.16 m)^2 Plugging in the values: U_initial ≈ 3.72 J U_final ≈ 9.88 J Work = U_final - U_initial = 9.88 J - 3.72 J Calculating the value: Work ≈ 6.16 J Therefore, the work done by the spring while it is being extended by the external force is approximately 6.16 J (Joules)."},{"prompt":"A simple pendulum consists of a small ball tied to a string and set in oscillation. As the pendulum swings the tension in the string is:","completion":"The tension in the string of a simple pendulum varies as the pendulum swings back and forth. At the maximum point of displacement (when the pendulum is at its highest point on one side), the tension in the string is at its minimum. This is because the only force acting on the ball at this point is the force of gravity pulling it downwards. At the lowest point of displacement (when the pendulum is at its lowest point on the other side), the tension in the string is at its maximum. This is because the force of gravity is acting downwards and is opposed by the tension in the string acting upwards. As the pendulum swings between these points, the tension in the string changes continuously, reaching its maximum and minimum values depending on the position of the pendulum. Therefore, the tension in the string of a simple pendulum is minimum at the highest point of displacement and maximum at the lowest point of displacement."},{"prompt":"A simple pendulum has a period of 2.50 sec. What is its length? ( use gravitational acceleration g = 9.8 m/s2)","completion":"The period (T) of a simple pendulum is related to its length (L) by the equation: T = 2π * √(L / g) where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Given that the period of the pendulum is 2.50 sec and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the length: L = (T^2 * g) / (4π^2) Plugging in the values: L = (2.50 sec)^2 * 9.8 m/s^2 / (4π^2) Simplifying the equation: L ≈ 1.59 m Therefore, the length of the simple pendulum is approximately 1.59 meters."},{"prompt":"как на C# с помощью Emgu сделать чтобы программа при нажатии кнопки вызывала часть кода /debug/scripts/getprice.cs сам файл находится в /debug/Form1.cs .

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, я попыталась ускориться. но она в меня врезалась, и я потеряла сознание, она тут-же подбежала ко мне взяв меня на руки, я прижалась к ней почувствовав тепло","completion":"и защиту, которые она мне дала.

The backbone of this philosophy is nationalism, often radical nationalism. Fascism supported industrialization and the working class. It stressed the importance of a single party government and above all else obedience to the state. Men were encouraged to learn basic military skills i.e marching, shooting, etc. Women were encouraged-and praised-for having many children that would grow and lead the country. The fascist philosophy advocated imperialism, as it believed that the only way a country could become great was through expansion therefore warfare. People tend to confuse fascism and communism, though there are clear differences between them. Fascism allows private ownership, controls the economy, emphasizes a social hierarchy, encourages racism and xenophobia (prejudice towards people from other countries), and has an aggressive foreign policy; As seen in Nazi Germany. Hitler was often quoted as he talked about ‘the superior race’ and his dislike of Jews. At the time Germany adopted a more aggressive foreign policy as well. On the other hand, communism banned all private ownership, controlled all aspects of the citizens' lives, abolished social order, didn’t support nationalism, and encouraged cooperation with other countries. Communism was most apparent in the Soviet Union. There were many negative effects of fascism, especially in Mussolini’s Italy. Political freedom was curbed, this was done in many ways such as banning publications that opposed fascists. Labor unions were outlawed to decrease the possibility of anyone speaking out against the regime. Mussolini was willing to use violence to silence and overcome his enemies, that much was clear when he marched on Rome in 1922. The main examples of fascism which will be covered in this paper are: 1) Mussolini and Fascist Italy 1922-1943 (PNF). 2) Nazi Germany 1933-1945. These examples are chosen as they show the gradual progression of countries that were dependent on western states to them being strong independent countries, all the while becoming fascist. Causes of Fascism Italy was one of the victors of the first world war, yet there was a large internal conflict going on. There was violence between political parties and between the people, most of this was because of the Treaty of London 1915. Through said treaty Italy should’ve been granted Trieste, southern Tyrol, and northern Dalmatia. France and Britain simply ignored Italy, which created a national humiliation in the country. Italy had economical issues pre-war, they depended on the western countries for trade and quite literally their entire economy. 2 million soldiers were promised farmland ownership, but these promises were not fulfilled (because Britain and France were not willing to give Italy its territories). The government was deeply in debt because of borrowing money from banks during the war. Riots, strikes, and religious involvement by the Catholic church pushed communist ideology through the streets of Italy as they people felt they had been dealt empty promises. Mussolini formed a party funded by banks, called the Black Shirts. The party grew in numbers and popularity. All these factors helped propel fascist ideology. Mussloni threatened to march on Rome. In a last ditch effort to retain his position, the King appointed him as Prime Minister. Effects of Fascism in Italy Among the first acts taken by the National Fascist Party was making themselves the only political party allowed. This was one of the many things they did to suppress public difference of opinion, which at the time was the root of Italy’s internal issues (as addressed earlier). There were many other things done to help reach this goal; publications that opposed fascism were banned, labor unions were no longer allowed (They were instead replaced by government organizations), conflicts with the Catholic Church were resolved, youth groups were made to teach fascist ideology, and lastly violence against anyone who disagreed. Under Mussolini’s rule, which lasted until 1943, there was no concept of free speech or expression. Italy’s foreign policy underwent many modifications during the fascist rule, especially considering it was during the Great Depression. In terms of economy and military, Italy was weak. It economically depended on the US and Britain for fuel and France for food. Mussolini feared that if he went to war with these countries or their allies that they would stop trade, which would cause a decrease in fuel and food would cause an increase in prices. A hungry and angry public would want a new leader, therefore Mussolini was very careful in conducting any form of foreign policy. Italian foreign policy depended on small meaningless victories such as an indemnity from Greece and the handover of Fiume in Yugoslavia. Both significantly weaker countries than the Great Powers. Italy exported goods to pay for food imports, raw materials, etc. When the Great Depression occurred countries such as Britain and the US erected trade barriers. Mussolini’s biggest fears had come true. He had to act quickly to prevent an economic collapse. Trades with Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungry, Bulgaria, and Romania were hurriedly established; all in an effort to prevent collapse and to build stronger eastern European connections. Italy exported to them manufactured goods and in return it got raw materials and food. The Great Depression allowed the Italian economy to no longer depend on the western countries, which in turn slowly began to solve their economic issues within the country. Industries were combined to eliminate competition, this led to major industries surviving the Depression. This allowed Italy to start manufacturing weapons such as rifles, tyres, shells, and engines. Manufacturing weapons aided in expanding the army. By 1935 the army and navy had 1 million new slots waiting to be filled, largely solving unemployment. All these factors turned Italy into a strong state which no longer depended on western countries. Causes and Effects of Fascism in Germany Fascism wasn’t only limited to Italy, it made its way to many other countries, most prominently to Germany. It’s safe to say that Germany collapsed after the first world war, especially since it held most of the financial burden. This collapse caused political and economical instability within the country. A new government emerged called the Weimar Republic, it attempted to make fragile peace in Germany. It was challenged by many other parties, namely fascist parties which made peace a fleeting dream. In 1933 Adolf Hitler was elected as Chancellor of Germany. It took Hitler many years to gain full control of Germany, namely because a few organizations opposed him. This made his power limited. He acted quickly to gain more power. Once elected, Hitler and the Nazi Party moved to stabilize and confirm their power. They did this through a number of methods, for starters they merged with the government. This allowed them to abolish all parties except the Nazi Party and abolish the labor union. Governors were replaced by Nazi Party members which caused little disagreement among the government. All police forces joined the Nazi Party’s paramilitary, otherwise known as the SS which acted like the state police. This meant that Germany’s military forces acted under a single leader, ultimately giving them full power over the country. Hitler was able to resolve exterior challenges, yet there were also challenges to be faced inside the Nazi Party itself. There were those in the Party who could’ve rivaled Hitler’s power. In 1934, he executed said members, all debate was gone after that. The only institution which was out of Hitler’s power was the army. At the time the army was led by the German nobility, they saw Hitler as an Austrian foreigner which could not be trusted. By 1938, Hitler had replaced all the military top commanders, leaving him in control of the army and therefore of all German institutions. A new government meant new policies. This was evident when Germany would only trade with countries who would purchase goods of equal value to what Germany imported. By 1934, the government was able to control what was all imports and exports at a molecular level. Having complete control over trade gave the German government a lot of power over the population and over other countries. Germany only imported essential goods while exporting manufactured goods, this aided Germany in recovering from the Great Depression (Germany recovered faster than any European state from the Depression, mainly because of new trade policies). Conclusion Fascism in Europe (specifically in Germany and Italy) had many causes and effects. One of the main causes was always internal distress, this is shown in both cases (Mussolini and Hitler). These internal conflicts were often because of an economic crisis. They led to the idea of an absolute government being pushed, people wanted their countries to stabilize and be powerful. Fascism promised nationalism, stability, expansion, and power; all things appealing. Fascism caused the end of free speech, expression, and political opinion. On the other hand, fascist countries displayed fast recovery from the Great Depression, in Italy’s case it left the Depression with a better economy than before it started. Each country was characterized by the leader and their own ideology. This is more present in Germany where Hitler advocated his xenophobe thinking. Italy made youth groups to help make the idea more appealing to a younger public. Fascism certainly helped both countries flourish economically and strengthen away from the western population. Unfortunately, it used barbaric methods to force opposition to remain silent.

One of the sky, a beautiful female named Sora. She resembles an angel straight from Michelangelo, a Valkyrie, and a harpy, with a melodic voice to boot. It's all in the limbs. The harpy comes in the form of winged arms. Two of her four arms are winged, the other pair resembling that of a human female. She has wings on her back, resembling that of an angel.","completion":"In the world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" special-grade cursed spirits are highly powerful and feared entities, each with unique and often terrifying abilities. Imagining a special-grade cursed spirit like Sora, who embodies elements of the sky and has an angelic appearance, adds a fascinating character to the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. Given the characteristics you've described, Sora would likely hold a set of powers consistent with her theme and appearance: 1. **Aerial Dominance:** With wings on both her arms and back, Sora would likely be extremely proficient in aerial combat, able to maneuver and attack from the sky with ease, giving her a strategic advantage over opponents who are less adept in the air. 2. **Sonic Abilities:** Considering her melodic voice, she could possess sonic-based attacks such as devastating screams that can shatter barriers or disorient foes, or even a hypnotic song that could lull adversaries into a false sense of security before she strikes. 3. **Control over the Skies:** Embodying the element of the sky, Sora might have the power to manipulate weather patterns or summon gusts of wind to buffet her enemies, potentially even using the winds to amplify her mobility and speed. 4. **Multi-Limbed Combat:** With four arms, two of which are winged, Sora could be a formidable opponent in close-quarters combat—able to unleash a barrage of strikes from multiple angles simultaneously. 5. **Divine Appearance:** Leveraging her angelic, Valkyrie, and harpy-like characteristics, Sora might have the ability to inspire awe or even fear in those who look upon her, potentially harnessing this to paralyze her enemies with a mere glance or presence. 6. **Cursed Techniques:** As a special-grade cursed spirit, Sora would have unique cursed techniques, likely connected to her sky theme. For example, she could have the ability to create vacuums or pockets of high pressure with her movements, or perhaps she could launch feathers as sharp projectiles. An important aspect to consider, in keeping with the style of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" would be Sora's cursed technique and how it relates to human emotions or actions, as many cursed spirits in the series are manifestations of collective human negativity. Perhaps Sora represents a collective human fear of natural disasters from the sky, such as storms or falling meteors. Introducing a character like Sora would undoubtedly add a thrilling dynamic to the series, especially if she has complex motives that tie into the overarching narrative and the balance between cursed spirits and jujutsu sorcerers."},{"prompt":"A domain expansion?","completion":"In \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" a Domain Expansion is an advanced cursed technique in which a sorcerer or cursed spirit creates a pocket dimension with a concentration of their own cursed energy. This space not only enhances their abilities but also forces any combat techniques or spells within to hit their target, a concept known as guaranteed hit. Often, the Domain Expansion reflects the user's nature, personality, and power. For Sora, the special-grade cursed spirit you've described, her Domain Expansion would likely be a grand manifestation of her sky-related theme. Here's a possible take on Sora's Domain Expansion: **Domain Expansion: Celestial Pantheon** 1. **Domain Appearance:** Upon activation, the domain would appear as an awe-inspiring expanse of the heavens. A firmament dotted with stars stretches far above, with floating islands or clouds serving as platforms. Ethereal light radiates all around, giving the impression of a celestial battlefield. 2. **Enhanced Abilities:** While inside her domain, Sora's aerial and sonic abilities would be vastly amplified. Her flights would be swifter, and her sonic attacks would resonate perfectly within the acoustic confines of her celestial space, perhaps even allowing her to create complex sonic patterns with multiple effects. 3. **Atmospheric Control:** Sora could manipulate the atmosphere within her domain at will, summoning fierce winds, creating sudden air pressure changes or storms to disorient and pressure opponents, or perhaps even simulating the oxygen-thin air of high altitudes to leave enemies breathless. 4. **Heavenly Projections:** The stars in her domain might be more than mere lights; they could serve as projections of her will, possibly allowing her to direct them as swift, devastating beams of energy or guiding them to form constellations that catalyze specific effects or summon celestial beings for assistance. 5. **Guaranteed Hit:** A thematic approach to the 'guaranteed hit' aspect could involve Sora's voice or her wing movements resonating with the sound and wind of the domain in such harmony that they become inescapable. 6. **Weaknesses:** As with all Domain Expansions, maintaining the space costs a significant amount of cursed energy. Furthermore, if opponents have a compatible technique or exceptional strength, they might be able to counter her domain with their own or resist the effects of her guaranteed hit. Sora's Domain Expansion would thus not only embody her elemental affinity and personal aesthetics but would also strategically play to her strengths. It would underscore her status as a formidable special-grade cursed spirit, adding depth to her character and further challenging the jujutsu sorcerers who dare to confront her."},{"prompt":"What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?","completion":"There are several habits of character that can help solve critical problems and contribute to a better community.

Concern for the environment, which has been so active since 2009 portrayed by EU politicians turned out to be a fiction, so its promotion failed. Wind power plants that have worked for less than 10 out of 25 years of operation are now being demolished in order to expand the quarry for the extraction of brown coal, which is the dirtiest fossil fuel in terms of emissions. The German government has allowed an additional 20 million tons of coal to be mined. But, according to a new study, even this coal turned out to be much more environmentally friendly than LNG delivered to Europe from the United States. And as for the wind turbines, if those eight stations that are to be demolished are not enough, then more will be demolished. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has already called it the \\"right decision,\\" and Green Party politician Oliver Krish called the extraction of an additional 20 million tons of coal per year \\"one of the greatest achievements we have achieved in recent years.\\" German energy giant RWE has begun dismantling a wind farm to make way for the expansion of its Harzweiler quarry At the same time, after the abandonment of Russian pipeline gas, suddenly the entire European wind industry began to experience record losses, even taking into account government support. So, for the three quarters of 2023, the wind energy division of Siemens, Siemens Gamesa, reported record losses of 2.2 billion euros. The audit revealed that 20% of turbines fail in the first years of operation, and up to 50% of installations require major maintenance in the first 10 years of operation. As soon as Germany abandoned Russian gas, various sores suddenly came out, even in the Of course, the report says that defects have been found in the bearings and blades, which can lead to cracks and structural damage. At least 1.1 billion dollars will be needed to eliminate defects. Yes, but the problem was found mainly on land-based wind turbines, the vast majority of which are located in Europe. Yes, wind turbines need to be serviced by conducting maintenance, just like any power plant, but before abandoning Russian gas, the shutdown of emergency wind turbines was immediately compensated by the operation of a gas turbine power plant. And now the parking of wind turbines leads to losses of 1 billion euros. Wind energy is unstable and requires generation alignment (energy buffering). This is done not with lithium-ion batteries, but with conventional gas or diesel fuel, because only these two options are economically justified. European scientists proved this back in 2013, when they analyzed the entire experience of operating wind turbines in Europe over the past 30 years. An excerpt from a research paper by scientists from institutes in Germany, Poland and Canada entitled \\"Energy intensities, EROIs, and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants\\". In it, scientists proved that solar and wind power plants do not overcome the minimum energy economic threshold. The economic profitability of solar and wind energy cannot be higher than coal or gas generation In a 2016 study by Swiss scientists, which summarizes the experience of EU countries in the use of solar energy, it is stated that the actual service life of solar panels is 17 years, instead of the stated 25. At the same time, solar activity was not enough even to generate the energy spent on their production and installation during their entire service life. As a result, they became energy absorbers! Scientists wrote about it in large print: \\"NET ENERGY LOSS\\"! The wind turbine will pay off after 16 years of operation - provided that any type of energy buffering is used, with the exception of gas or diesel. That is why Scotland's wind turbines were powered by diesel generators for internal heating and electricity generation when the wind turbines themselves stopped or went into emergency mode. A scandal! \\"Dozens of giant turbines at Scottish wind farms powered by diesel generators. Scottish Power has admitted that 71 of its windmills were connected to a fossil fuel source after a failure in their electricity supply.\\" As everyone knows, ecology in the EU decides a lot. For example, more recently in Germany, environmentalists fought for the active exploitation of the Nord Stream, pointing out that the carbon intensity of the Nord Stream is 6.3 tons of CO₂ equivalent per 1 megajoule of energy released, while the same indicator of the Turkish Stream is 7.3 tons, the Ukrainian route is 10.6, and the LNG delivery rate from the USA — 22.3. Yes, these estimates in 2019 were cited by European environmentalists themselves as the fact that Russian gas is the most environmentally friendly for the economy not only of Germany, but of the whole of Europe. However, the United States denied everything at that time, insisting on incorrect assessments of the environmental friendliness of their LNG, which is not only impregnated with \\"freedom molecules\\", but also much more environmentally friendly than anything the EU buys in Russia. And as soon as the operation of the Nord Streams was over, the United States suddenly changed its shoes in flight, publishing on November 23, 2023, a multi-year study stating that any LNG, including from the United States, is much dirtier than local coal used in the energy industry. Here's a twist... An excerpt from a study by Cornell University scientists: \\"Greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life cycle of LNG under four different tanker transportation scenarios using global average flight time. Excerpt from the study: Greenhouse gas emissions over the entire life cycle of LNG under four different tanker transportation scenarios using the longest flight time The general conclusion of scientists is that even when choosing the most environmentally friendly ships and the shortest delivery routes, the use of LNG produces 24% higher greenhouse gas emissions than when burning coal. In the worst case, LNG generates 274% more emissions than coal combustion. An excerpt from a study by Cornell University scientists. In their study, scientists from the United States indicate the following directly in the annotation: \\"Although some proponents of LNG claim that it benefits the climate by replacing coal, the analysis presented here completely refutes this. In all the scenarios considered, the total greenhouse gas emissions from LNG are greater than from coal, and range from 24% to 274%.\\" Excerpt from the study It would seem, why are they publishing this? They also openly discredit their own LNG industry, on which today (for lack of a choice) most of Europe completely depends, in which environmental aspects have always been in the first place. And what is the result? Europe, which is actively abandoning coal in favor of gas and renewable energy sources, according to these data, is beginning to violate its own standards of environmental impact on the environment. Moreover, buying American LNG, the same Germany harms the environment more than if the Germans extracted a similar amount of coal from their fields, of which there are plenty in Germany. It turns out to be a vicious circle when buying from an American (or from any other country) LNG, ostensibly for the sake of ecology, is more harmful than coal mining, although at the UN climate conference in 2021, European countries signed an agreement to abandon the use of coal in energy by 2030-2040, referring to the fact that the use of coal is the main cause of \\"global warming\\". China, Australia, India and even the United States, which account for 73% of global coal consumption in the energy sector, refused to make such commitments. Moreover, European environmental policy had to receive a certain rent, which promised them very attractive and profitable positions in the global \\"carbon-free\\" economy. The cost of the carbon tax quotas was supposed to bring a significant part of the revenue to the EU budget. It was predicted that in 2023, the cost of emission quotas contained in imported \\"carbon footprint\\" products would be set based on the cost of CO2 at auctions in the European quota trading system (EU ETS) and would reach 200-250 per ton. But today, any country, especially the United States, referring to this study, can refuse to pay tax. Moreover, the Europeans themselves must pay an additional duty to the US budget for any goods exported from the USA to the EU, because the final carbon footprint when using American LNG in the EU will be higher than the carbon footprint of a similar product produced outside Europe using coal-fired energy, not to mention gas or nuclear energy... It turns out that The Americans have fooled Scholz... To even out the carbon tax situation, the EU needs to abandon any LNG and start producing coal to replace it. This is the only way to achieve carbon tax parity with imported goods. Only the EU has signed an official agreement to phase out coal and replace it with natural gas. The only case when natural gas in the EU will benefit from coal in terms of environmental friendliness is pipeline supplies via Nord Streams via a direct route from Russia to Germany, bypassing any gas hubs. German environmentalists were right when they said in 2019 that gas from the Nord Streams is the cleanest carbon source of energy, which provides not only energy security, but also gives Germany undeniable advantages in terms of carbon trading. That's all, the ecological trap has been closed. However, Europe itself got into it ...].","completion":"The Dirty Secret Behind Europe's Green Transition Introduction: The United States' Restriction on Russian Gas In a shocking turn of events, the United States has not only prohibited the purchase of Russian gas in Europe but also its LNG. This decision has significant implications for Europe's energy industry and its green transition. However, it seems that the concerns for the environment, which have been so fervently promoted by EU politicians since 2009, were nothing but a facade. The recent developments in Germany further expose the hypocrisy surrounding Europe's environmental agenda. Part 1: Demolishing Wind Power Plants for Brown Coal Extraction Germany, known for its emphasis on renewable energy, has now commenced the demolition of wind power plants that have been operational for less than 10 out of 25 years. These wind turbines are being dismantled to make way for the expansion of a quarry for the extraction of brown coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel in terms of emissions. Surprisingly, the German government has permitted an additional 20 million tons of coal to be mined, contradicting its supposed commitment to environmental protection. Part 2: Environmental Impact of LNG and Wind Turbines Although the move away from Russian pipeline gas has been hailed by some, it has had unforeseen consequences. The European wind industry is experiencing record losses, despite government support. Siemens Gamesa, a major player in the wind energy sector, reported losses of 2.2 billion euros in the first three quarters of 2023. The audit of wind turbines reveals a concerning reality - 20% of the turbines fail within the first few years of operation, and nearly 50% require major maintenance within the first decade. The shutdown of wind turbines, coupled with the absence of Russian gas, has resulted in billion-dollar losses. Part 3: Unstable Wind Energy and Ineffective Solar Panels Wind energy, touted as a renewable solution, is far from reliable. It requires energy buffering, typically achieved through the use of conventional gas or diesel fuel. Lithium-ion batteries are not economically justified for this purpose. European scientists have concluded that wind and solar power plants do not meet the minimum energy economic threshold. Additionally, solar panels have demonstrated a shorter service life of 17 years instead of the claimed 25 years. These panels fail to generate sufficient energy to offset their own production and installation costs, resulting in a net energy loss. Part 4: The Dirty Truth About LNG and Coal The United States, which vigorously contested the environmental friendliness of Russian gas in the past, has now released a multi-year study stating that LNG, including American LNG, is significantly dirtier than local coal used in the energy industry. The study from Cornell University reveals that even when considering the most environmentally friendly ships and shortest delivery routes, LNG produces up to 274% more greenhouse gas emissions than coal. This revelation challenges Europe's reliance on LNG and raises questions about its commitment to environmental protection. Conclusion: Europe Trapped in Environmental Hypocrisy Europe finds itself caught in a vicious cycle of environmental hypocrisy. By purchasing American LNG, countries like Germany are inadvertently harming the environment more than if they were to extract an equivalent amount of coal domestically. This situation directly contradicts the commitments made at the UN climate conference and undermines Europe's efforts to transition to a carbon-free economy. Furthermore, the US study on LNG emissions creates a loophole for countries to avoid carbon taxes and imposes additional duties on EU goods exported to the USA. To achieve carbon tax parity, the EU must abandon LNG and revert to coal production, contradicting its agreement to phase out coal. In the end, it appears that the United States has deceived Europe, trapping it in an ecological dilemma. The only viable solution lies in the pipeline supplies of Russian gas through Nord Streams, which not only ensure energy security but also boost Germany's advantages in carbon trading."},{"prompt":"Công ty TNHH SX TM LỬA HỒNG nộp thuế theo PP khấu trừ, thuế suất 10%, hạch toán hàng tồn kho theo phương pháp kê khai thường xuyên, tính giá xuất kho theo phương pháp nhập trước xuất trước chuyên sản xuất và kinh doanh sản phẩm H có tình hình tiêu thụ hàng hóa H trong tháng như sau: Số dư đầu tháng 09/2015 - TK 156 : 300.000.000 (10.000sp H với đơn giá 30.000đ /sp; 1.

Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, я попыталась ускориться. но она в меня врезалась, и я потеряла сознание, она тут-же подбежала ко мне взяв меня на руки, я прижалась к ней почувствовав её теплоту, поцеловала в шею","completion":", оставив след отпечатка губ на ее коже.

Она, узнав, что я проснулась, приблизилась ко мне с элегантностью хищницы. В ее глазах я увидела лишь безумие и садистскую удовлетворенность. Она заявила, что я стала ее новой игрушкой, и она намерена разрушить мою жизнь как ни одну другую. Она начала подробно описывать свои злоключения, связанные с другими женщинами, которые стали объектами ее интереса. Меня охватило чувство отчаяния - я была пленницей безвыходной ситуации. Но в моем внутреннем голосе все еще горела искра надежды и решимости. Я стала преследовать план побега. Глядя на окна комнаты, я поняла, что они были слишком высоко, чтобы я смогла выбраться. Однако, заметив дверь сзади меня, я поняла, что это мой единственный шанс на свободу. Благодаря своей силе воли и физической подготовке, я смогла освободиться от веревки, которой меня приковали к стулу. Апостроф вызывала зарубки на моих запястьях, но я не обращала на это внимания.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"Among the maze of flat-pack furniture and Swedish meatball scents, an unconventional group of employees worked the floor of the most extraordinary IKEA that ever was. This store was staffed by individuals not usually known for their customer service or their camaraderie: they were the rogue A.I. monitor known as 343 Guilty Spark, the treacherous bio-terrorist Albert Wesker, the notorious mad scientist Doctor Wily, and, soaring above them, the terrifying space dragon Ridley from the Metroid universe. IKEA had never before required staff with such unique... qualifications, but looming chaos in the retail sector spurred innovation in the most unlikely of ways. Their first day on the job had these four placed in the self-service warehouse, tasked with the seemingly mundane, yet incredibly chaotic task of restocking and assisting customers. \\"Attention, revered patrons,\\" chimed 343 Guilty Spark, floating along the aisles with a polite yet eerie tone to his voice. \\"The KALLAX shelving units are currently available on aisle 25B, following the natural pedestrian traffic pattern outlined on your complimentary store maps.\\" Albert Wesker stood imposingly by the organization bins, his sunglasses reflecting the fluorescent store lighting, hiding the glare of annoyance. He was straightening out a pile of disheveled FRAKTA bags when a confused couple approached him. \\"Excuse me, sir,\\" a woman timidly asked. \\"Could you help us? We're looking for the EKTORP sofa cover and we can't seem to locate it.\\" Wesker glanced at them, a sense of superiority flashing in his eyes before being masked by professional indifference. \\"EKTORP, you say? Aisle 16C. Make sure you read the labels properly; we wouldn't want any... accidents with incorrect purchases,\\" he said, with a sinister undertone that made the couple exchange worried looks. In the corner, at the returns desk, Doctor Wily was frantically typing on the computer, his wild hair fluttering as he muttered to himself about the inferiority of human-designed databases compared to his own robotic masterpieces. \\"Stupid, simple furniture... If they had my genius, they'd have self-assembling tables by now,\\" Wily grumbled, gripping a pencil so tightly it snapped. Just then, a customer approached, lugging a massive, partially disassembled HEMNES bed frame. \\"Doctor, I—I mean, sir, I can't make heads or tails of these instructions,\\" the customer stammered, laying out the cryptic booklet before Wily. Wily took a deep, exasperated sigh, snatched the manual, and quickly skimmed the pages. \\"It's just like constructing a robust robot! Piece by piece, orderly and efficient. But I suppose I must lower myself to human standards and assist you. Lay out the pieces by number, and we'll follow the steps...\\" he instructed, begrudgingly kneading his brain power into the assembly. Meanwhile, a child's scream cut through the cacophony of the store. Ridley, who had been tasked with the improbable job of managing the children's play area SMÅLAND, hovered menacingly above. The children, at first, had cowered at the sight of the winged behemoth, but as time ticked by, his fierce exterior proved to be a hit. Surprisingly, his draconic features and imposing stature made for an enchanting storyteller as he regaled the youngsters with tales of far-off galaxies—not that he had much choice, considering the impracticality of his claws for assembling STUVA wardrobes. \\"Annnnnd then, the mighty hero Samus, armored in her suit, faced the creature with bravery unmatched!\\" Ridley roared, the kids hanging onto his every word, their fears forgotten. It was not without a tinge of reluctance that he played the part of the villain in his stories, secretively enjoying the rapt attention. This day at the furniture store collection yielded a peculiar sort of peace among the four notorious characters. IKEA's knack for creating order from chaos aligned in a certain harmony with their own desires for control and mastery in their respective realms. They found that even as they instructed customers on the differences between the LIATORP and HEMNES, or explained the benefits of the PAX wardrobe system, there was an almost therapeutic rhythm to the work. \\"Replenishing stock has proven to be an ineffably efficacious method for inventory control,\\" 343 Guilty Spark remarked to his colleagues during their mandated fika break, the Swedish custom of a coffee and cake break. \\"Who would have thought,\\" Wesker added dryly, sipping his coffee with a sense of irony, \\"that organization and manipulation of furniture could be so similar to our... other endeavors.\\" Doctor Wily nodded in agreement, his mouth full of kanelbulle, the cinnamon roll leaving traces of sugar in his wild moustache. \\"Indeed. Perhaps we could take some lessons from this experience—incorporate them into our own schemes.\\" Ridley said nothing but let out a low, rumbling chuckle, causing a vibrato in the tiny cups set before them. As the day neared its end and the sun dipped below the horizon outside, the unlikely quartet found themselves reflecting on the day's work. Amid the Swedish designs and budget prices, there had been unlikely lessons in patience, cooperation, and maybe—a very guarded maybe—a hint of humility. As they clocked out, the overhead lights dimmed in the cavernous store, their shadows stretched long and monstrous across the yellow and blue décor. They parted ways with peculiar, newfound respects for the other's capabilities, each lost in the thought that if they could conquer the flat-pack furniture and customer service... perhaps there was more common ground than they had known."},{"prompt":"40mb lık bir online browser oyunu tahmini 10dk lık bir oturumda ne kadar trafik harcar","completion":"Bir oyunun 10 dakikalık bir oturumda ne kadar trafik harcayacağı, oyundaki içerik, kullanıcıların hareketleri ve oyunun performansı gibi birçok faktöre bağlıdır.

I think it's important to talk about the things that make us angry or upset. How about you? B: I agree, discussing what angers us can be pretty therapeutic. There are a few things that come to my mind immediately. One of them is when people are consistently late. It irritates me when someone doesn't respect the agreed-upon time and keeps me waiting for long periods. A: Oh, I can definitely relate to that. It's frustrating when people don't value your time. For me, one thing that makes me angry is when someone is rude or disrespectful for no apparent reason. It can completely ruin my mood, especially if it happens in a professional or social setting. B: I completely understand. It's disheartening when someone's rudeness is unwarranted and takes you by surprise. Another thing that makes me angry is when people make false promises or don't fulfill their commitments. It feels like they disregard the impact of their words on others or simply lack integrity. A: I can see why that would frustrate you. It's disappointing when people don't follow through on what they say they'll do. Something that really gets under my skin is when I witness injustice or unfair treatment. Seeing someone being treated poorly due to discrimination or biases makes my blood boil. B: Absolutely, witnessing injustice is infuriating. It's just not right when people are mistreated or discriminated against solely based on their race, gender, or any other aspect of their identity. Another thing that makes me angry is when people refuse to take responsibility for their actions or constantly shift blame onto others. A: That's a good point. It's essential for individuals to hold themselves accountable for their actions. Blaming others and avoiding responsibility not only prolongs conflicts but also prevents personal growth. Another thing that tends to make me angry is when people show a lack of empathy or compassion towards others. B: I completely agree. Empathy and compassion are crucial qualities for building positive relationships and fostering a caring society. When someone lacks those qualities, it can be really frustrating and disheartening. It's important to remember that we're all human and need understanding. A: Absolutely, empathy is the foundation of a harmonious society. Discussing these anger-inducing factors can be quite cathartic. It allows us to identify and reflect on what bothers us and find healthier ways to deal with our anger."},{"prompt":"социальное обеспечение то","completion":"Социальное обеспечение - это система государственного поддержания субъектов общества, которая предусматривает различные виды социальных выплат и льгот.

Why is this? How could this be controlled?","completion":"It is irrefutable that the manufacturing and use of cars contribute to environmental degradation, yet their popularity continues to soar. This phenomenon can be attributed to various factors, such as affordability, convenience, and societal norms. Nevertheless, effective measures can be taken to control this issue and minimize its detrimental impact on the environment. The first reason why cars continue to gain popularity despite their negative environmental effects is their affordability. Automobile manufacturers have made significant advancements in production technology, enabling them to offer vehicles at an affordable price range. As a result, an increasing number of individuals from all socio-economic backgrounds can now afford to purchase cars. This accessibility has propelled the demand for cars and subsequently led to their widespread use. The second major factor contributing to the increasing popularity of cars is convenience. Cars provide a swift, comfortable, and personalized mode of transportation that is unparalleled by any other means of commuting. With the fast-paced lifestyles of modern society, individuals often require quick and direct travel options to meet their daily commitments. Cars offer the flexibility and efficiency that public transportation systems or alternative modes of transport cannot consistently provide. This convenience has further fueled the preference for cars among the masses. Societal norms and cultural influences also play a significant role in the rising popularity of cars. In many countries, car ownership is often associated with social status and seen as a symbol of success and prosperity. This perception drives individuals to aspire to own cars, even when other transport alternatives may be more environmentally friendly. As people strive to conform to societal expectations, the demand for cars continues to rise, disregarding the environmental consequences. To control and mitigate the adverse environmental impact caused by cars, various measures can be implemented. Firstly, governments should enforce stricter regulations on vehicle manufacturing. Mandatory emission standards for vehicles can be enhanced, leading to the production of more eco-friendly cars. Additionally, investing in research and development to promote the production of electric or hybrid vehicles can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the automotive industry. Furthermore, robust public transportation systems can be implemented to provide viable alternatives to car usage. Governments should allocate resources to improve the availability, affordability, and efficiency of public transport networks. Furthermore, encouraging cycling and walking by creating dedicated lanes, improving infrastructure, and promoting their health benefits can deter individuals from relying solely on cars for short-distance travel. Education and awareness campaigns also play a pivotal role in controlling car usage and promoting environmentally friendly alternatives. Governments, along with environmental organizations, can conduct public outreach programs to educate individuals about the negative impact of cars on the ecosystem. This could include highlighting the benefits of carpooling, advocating for car-sharing services, and raising awareness about the importance of using public transportation or non-vehicular modes of transport for short trips. In conclusion, the popularity of cars continues to increase despite their detrimental impact on the environment. This can be attributed to their affordability, convenience, and cultural influences. However, by enforcing stricter regulations on vehicle manufacturing, improving public transportation systems, and promoting education and awareness campaigns, we can effectively control the unfavorable consequences of car usage and steer society towards more sustainable transportation alternatives."},{"prompt":"Why cars are convenient?","completion":"Cars are often considered convenient for several reasons. Firstly, owning a car provides individuals with the flexibility and freedom to travel whenever and wherever they desire. Unlike public transportation, which operates on fixed schedules and predetermined routes, cars allow individuals to tailor their travel plans according to their specific needs and preferences. This convenience is especially valuable in areas with limited or inadequate public transportation options. Secondly, cars offer a comfortable and personalized mode of transportation. They provide a private space where individuals can control the temperature, adjust the seating position, and choose their preferred music or entertainment. This level of comfort is particularly important for individuals with medical conditions, physical disabilities, or those traveling with young children. Moreover, cars offer door-to-door transportation, eliminating the need to walk to bus stops or train stations. This can be especially advantageous in areas with extreme weather conditions, long distances between destinations, or when carrying heavy or bulky items. The convenience of having a vehicle at one's disposal can save time and effort, allowing individuals to efficiently manage their daily commitments and obligations. Another factor contributing to the convenience of cars is the ability to transport multiple passengers or goods. Unlike public transportation, which may become overcrowded during rush hours or limit the amount of luggage one can carry, cars offer ample space for passengers and belongings. This flexibility is beneficial for families, individuals traveling with pets, or those needing to transport large items for work or leisure. Additionally, cars provide a sense of security and safety. Occupants have control over their immediate surroundings and can lock the doors, activate security systems, or park in well-lit areas to minimize the risk of theft or harm. This added sense of security can be particularly comforting, especially for those traveling at odd hours or in unfamiliar areas. In conclusion, cars are considered convenient due to the flexibility, comfort, personalized experience, door-to-door transportation, and ability to transport multiple passengers or goods. While their convenience is undeniable, it is crucial to address the environmental consequences associated with their use and explore sustainable alternatives to minimize their negative impact on the planet."},{"prompt":"Write a band 9 IELTS Writing task 2 essay for this question: Many people want to look younger than their real age. What are the causes of this? Is this a positive or negative development? (Positive)","completion":"In contemporary society, a growing number of individuals are showing a keen desire to appear younger than their chronological age. This phenomenon can be attributed to various causes, such as societal pressure, the influence of media, and the pursuit of personal happiness. It is argued that this inclination towards youthful appearances is largely positive, as it promotes self-confidence, healthy lifestyles, and an age-inclusive society. One significant cause driving this desire to look younger is the societal pressure to adhere to certain beauty standards. In many cultures, youthfulness is equated with attractiveness, vitality, and success. As a result, individuals feel a constant need to maintain a youthful appearance in order to meet societal expectations and enhance their self-worth. This pressure stems from social norms, peer influence, and the relentless pursuit of an idealized image that is perpetuated by the media. Furthermore, the influence of media plays a pivotal role in perpetuating the desire to look younger. Advertisements, celebrity culture, and social media platforms consistently portray images of youthful individuals as symbols of beauty, success, and happiness. This continuous exposure to age-defying messages creates an aspirational mindset among people, pushing them to invest in various cosmetic procedures, skincare products, and fitness regimes in order to preserve a youthful aesthetic. Moreover, the pursuit of personal happiness is another driving force behind the desire to appear younger. Many individuals believe that looking younger will enhance their self-esteem, boost their social interactions, and improve their overall quality of life. By maintaining a youthful appearance, they hope to project an image of vitality, energy, and attractiveness, allowing them to navigate life's challenges and opportunities with confidence and optimism. Despite differing opinions on this matter, the inclination towards appearing younger can be considered a predominantly positive development. Firstly, it promotes self-confidence and self-esteem, enabling individuals to feel more comfortable and content in their own skin. By investing in their physical appearance, people can improve their self-perception and cultivate a positive body image, which in turn positively impacts their mental health and overall well-being. Secondly, the desire to look younger often leads individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles. In order to achieve and maintain a youthful appearance, people are more inclined to prioritize regular exercise, a well-balanced diet, and adequate skincare routines. These positive lifestyle choices not only contribute to physical health but also have long-term benefits for mental well-being and longevity. Lastly, the inclination towards appearing younger promotes an age-inclusive society where individuals of all ages are valued and respected. It challenges stereotypes and discrimination based on age, fostering an environment that appreciates and celebrates the wisdom, experience, and contributions of individuals across all age groups. In conclusion, the desire to appear younger than one's chronological age can be attributed to societal pressure, media influence, and the pursuit of personal happiness. Despite varying perspectives on this phenomenon, it is overwhelmingly positive as it boosts self-confidence, promotes healthy lifestyles, and fosters an age-inclusive society. As long as the pursuit of youthfulness is balanced and based on personal satisfaction rather than societal pressure, individuals can derive genuine benefits from maintaining a youthful appearance."},{"prompt":"Write a band 9 IELTS Writing task 2 essay for this question: People living in large cities today face many problems in their everyday lives. What are these problems? Should governments encourage people to move to smaller regional towns?","completion":"In the modern era, residents of large cities confront numerous challenges in their daily lives. These issues include overcrowding, traffic congestion, pollution, increased cost of living, and limited access to green spaces. While moving to smaller regional towns can alleviate some of these problems, governments should adopt measures to promote a balanced distribution of population and resources across both urban and regional areas. One of the main predicaments faced by city dwellers is overcrowding. Large cities often experience rapid population growth due to factors such as rural-urban migration and a higher concentration of job opportunities. This leads to increased competition for resources, longer commutes, and a higher cost of living. Moreover, traffic congestion is a persistent problem in urban areas, resulting in wasted time, increased fuel consumption, and elevated pollution levels. These issues combined contribute to decreased quality of life for city residents. Furthermore, pollution is a major concern in densely populated cities. The high concentration of vehicles, industrial activities, and dense construction contribute to air and noise pollution, increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses, allergies, and other health issues. Additionally, the limited availability of green spaces in large cities deprives residents of access to recreational areas, which can have adverse effects on mental well-being and overall quality of life. Considering these challenges, it is reasonable to suggest that governments should encourage people to relocate to smaller regional towns. Relocating to these areas can offer several advantages. Firstly, regional towns generally offer a lower cost of living, thus allowing residents to attain a higher standard of living with fewer financial burdens. Reduced housing costs, lower utility bills, and more affordable amenities can contribute to improved financial stability and greater disposable income. Secondly, moving to smaller towns can alleviate issues such as overcrowding, traffic congestion, and pollution, as the population is more evenly distributed. This can lead to shorter commuting times, less congestion on roads, improved air quality, and a greater sense of community. Smaller towns often have less pollution and offer a healthier environment, providing opportunities for residents to lead more balanced and sustainable lifestyles. However, while encouraging migration to regional areas is beneficial, it is crucial for governments to maintain a balanced approach. Cities play a crucial role as centers of economic and cultural activities, fostering innovation, employment opportunities, and important infrastructure. Completely abandoning large cities in favor of regional towns may lead to a concentration of resources and limited opportunities, disadvantaging those who cannot or do not wish to relocate. Governments should instead adopt measures to promote a balanced distribution of population and resources. This can include implementing policies to incentivize businesses to establish branches or headquarters in regional areas, enhancing infrastructure and connectivity between cities and towns, and providing financial incentives for individuals to settle in regional towns. By doing so, governments can ensure that cities retain their vitality while simultaneously alleviating the challenges faced by city residents. In conclusion, residents of large cities face a myriad of problems such as overcrowding, traffic congestion, pollution, increased cost of living, and limited access to green spaces. While encouraging migration to smaller regional towns can mitigate these issues, governments should strive to promote a balanced distribution of population and resources. By implementing measures to alleviate challenges in both urban and regional areas, governments can create a more sustainable and inclusive living environment for all residents."},{"prompt":"Tại công ty TNHH HOA HỒNG nộp thuế theo PP khấu trừ, thuế suất 10%, hạch toán hàng tồn kho theo phương pháp kê khai thường xuyên, tính giá xuất kho theo phương pháp nhập trước xuất trước, có tình hình kinh doanh thành phẩm M như sau: (Đơn vị tính: đồng) Tồn kho thành phẩm M đầu kỳ: 1.200.000.000 (2.000 sản phẩm, đơn giá 600.000đ /sp.)

Centralized control: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exercises significant control over the legislative process. The National People's Congress (NPC), which is the highest organ of state power, is largely under the influence of the CCP, with the party playing a crucial role in shaping legislative decisions. The NPC Standing Committee, composed of top CCP officials, often determines legislative agendas and can have a considerable influence on the final outcome of legislation. 2. Party dominance: The CCP dominates the legislative process through its control over the NPC. The overwhelming majority of NPC deputies are members of the CCP or part of its allied organizations. This allows the party to ensure that its policies and decisions are effectively implemented through legislation and to control the overall direction of the country. 3. Stability and economic development focus: Chinese legislation is often driven by a desire to maintain social stability and promote economic development. The CCP seeks to avoid any legislation that could potentially disrupt social harmony or challenge its political authority. Economic policies and laws to attract foreign investment, promote innovation, and spur economic growth are given high priority. 4. Top-down approach: Legislative decisions in China typically originate at the top and are then implemented at lower levels of government. While there is some degree of deliberation and consultation during the legislative process, the ultimate decision-making power lies with the CCP and its top leadership. Public input and participation in the legislative process are limited, with dissenting voices often suppressed or marginalized. 5. Emphasis on social control: Chinese legislation often aims to maintain social order and control by regulating various aspects of society, including political dissent, religious practices, media censorship, and internet regulations. Laws related to national security and public order are designed to reinforce the party's authority and protect its interests. It is important to note that the above description is a generalization and may not capture all aspects of China's legislative behavior, which is influenced by a complex mix of political, economic, social, and cultural factors."},{"prompt":"Write a story where 343 Guilty Spark, Albert Wesker, Doctor Wily and Ganondorf are working at IKEA. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In a universe where lines between reality and fiction blur, where dimensions intertwine in the intricate fabric of existence, a peculiar IKEA store emerged, standing out against the gray skies of nondescript Suburbia. This was no ordinary IKEA - for within its maze-like corridors and amidst the smell of Swedish meatballs and particle board, worked an odd coalition of fictional characters. On a particularly busy Saturday, under the unflinching glare of fluorescent lights, 343 Guilty Spark floated through the labyrinth of showrooms, his blue eye pulsing with an otherworldly light. \\"Attention, customers,\\" the Forerunner monitor announced in its neatly modulated voice. \\"The 'LACK' coffee tables are currently on sale. Please refrain from hovering over them excessively, as it may cause traffic disruptions. Thank you.\\" At the returns desk, Dr. Albert Wesker, his blonde hair slicked back and his usual leather attire replaced by the standard yellow and blue IKEA uniform, surveyed the long line with undisguised disdain. In his world, he was a mastermind aiming for godhood, but here he was, processing returns for EKTORP sofas and BILLY bookcases. A woman approached Wesker with a dismantled chair in her cart. \\"Excuse me, this chair broke the first time I sat on it,\\" she complained, frustration evident in her tone. Wesker raised an eyebrow. \\"You must understand that improper assembly can lead to sub-optimal performance of the furniture,\\" he said, voice smooth yet implying she was at fault. \\"But I followed the instructions exactly!\\" she protested. Wesker took the instruction booklet, flipping through it with a dramatic flourish. \\"Then it appears the problem lies with the product. We shall replace it with one befitting your... needs,” he replied curtly, initiating the exchange with reluctant professionalism. Meanwhile, at the warehouse's robot assembly division, Dr. Thomas Wily, a genius at constructing formidable robots, was having the time of his life. Or so one would think. Instead of world domination, he was relegated to assembling LIDHULT sofas and PAX wardrobes. \\"Curse these manual labor tasks! In another world, my Robot Masters would crush these wooden planks with sheer might!\\" Wily muttered to himself, pushing up his round glasses. Suddenly, he was struck by inspiration. \\"That's it! I shall create an assembly robot to do these menial tasks for me!\\" He quickly cobbled together a rudimentary robot from spare appliance parts and named it ASMBL-01. \\"Go forth, my creation, and assemble!\\" he commanded grandiosely. ASMBL-01 whirred to life, its mechanical arms whizzing as it started assembling furniture at a breakneck pace. In the textiles section, Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, begrudgingly folded a stack of GURLI throw blankets. His imposing figure and fiery hair attracted looks from customers, but his brooding presence kept them at bay. \\"To think that I, Ganondorf, would be folding blankets while holding back my power,\\" he grumbled. A young couple approached him cautiously. \\"Excuse me, sir. Could you help us find these SKOGSNÄVA curtains?\\" they asked, holding up a crumpled shopping list. Ganondorf's eyes narrowed as he glanced at the item number. \\"Follow me, mortals,\\" he said, his voice deep and resonant. He strode through the aisles with an air of royalty, the couple hurrying after him. \\"Here,\\" he said, pointing at the curtains with a florish of his hand. \\"Would that be all you require of Ganondorf?\\" The couple nodded, thanking him profusely before scuttling away with the curtains. In the cafeteria, 343 Guilty Spark floated around, ensuring that all was in order and that the Swedish meatballs remained a crowd favorite. \\"You seem to be of assistance to these...consumers,\\" Dr. Wily commented, joining Guilty Spark as ASMBL-01 clattered behind him. \\"Indeed, Dr. Wily. It is imperative to maintain order,\\" 343 Guilty Spark replied, scanning a tray left on a table. \\"And what contraption is this?\\" \\"A marvel of my genius! ASMBL-01 will revolutionize the furniture assembly process!\\" Wily boasted. \\"Most intriguing. However, I believe your device is headed towards the...\\" before 343 Guilty Spark could finish, ASMBL-01 crashed into a stack of trays, creating a cacophony that echoed through the cafeteria. At that moment, Wesker strode up to them, the woman with the chair issue trailing behind him holding her new chair, smiling. \\"Gentlemen, it seems your projects could use a little more... refinement.\\" Wesker's eyes glinted with something akin to amusement. \\"And maybe a little less destruction.\\" Ganondorf approached from the textiles section, the sound of mechanical clattering and human complaints drawing his interest. \\"And what chaos do we have here on this fine day?\\" The odd foursome gathered, observing the mess and customers staring in dismay. They shared a moment of silence, acknowledging the absurdity of their situation. \\"Wily, contain your robot,\\" Wesker instructed, his tone commanding. \\"Guilty Spark, perhaps you should provide customers with... ample warnings about our... unique services,\\" Ganondorf suggested with a smirk. \\"The merging of our minds and efforts could indeed improve the productivity of this establishment,\\" 343 Guilty Spark contemplated aloud. And so, they worked together - the tyrannical store manager Ganondorf, the eerily efficient service robot overseer 343 Guilty Spark, the customer service enforcer Wesker, and the robotically enhanced assembly manager Wily. They turned the IKEA into an inexplicably efficient, albeit slightly intimidating shopping experience that consumers would not soon forget. Their legendary alliance, forged in the aisles of reasonably priced flat-pack furniture and Swedish culinary delights, would be an anecdote shared across realms, a tale of four villains united by a common, albeit mundane, cause."},{"prompt":"В один прекрасный день, я пришла в поликлинику за талоном к врачу и стоя в очереди к свободному окну регистратуры, приметила симпатичную медсестру, и пока шла очередь я не могла отвести от неё глаз, с каждым человеком кому она выдавала талон, я всё ближе и ближе приближалась к ней и вот он тот самый момент, когда во всей очереди осталась стоять только я, подойдя к стойке регистратуры я взглянула на неё в полной мере и неожиданно замерла. Она оказалась не просто красивой медсестрой а выглядела как фотомодель, забыв зачем и к кому я пришла, я стала смотреть на её лицо, ноги, бюст и прекрасно сложенное тело. Её глаза были глубокими и проницательными, а улыбка – такая чарующая, что я не могла оторваться от этого образа. Она с лёгкой улыбкой спросила, чем может помочь. Я, немного сбившись с толку, бросила взгляд на стол перед собой и нескладно произнесла, что мне нужен талон к врачу. На моё удивление, она сделала это с такой грацией и лёгкостью, словно была рождена для этого. Не хотя отпускать её руку, я подмигнула ей на прощание, поняв что просто так уйти, я не смогу, я решила вернуться в свою машину и ждать, пока она соберётся и пойдёт домой Она, кажется, заметила мой интерес и ответила взглядом, который был полон таинственности и приглашения. Я не знала, что мне делать, но сердце говорило мне, что мне нужно познакомиться с ней. Я решила, что не могу просто так уйти и решила подождать, пока она закончит свою смену. Села в свою машину и запустила двигатель, но не смогла уехать. Я была полностью поглощена мыслями о ней. Она просто притягивала меня своей красотой и грацией. Прошло некоторое время, и наконец, она вышла из поликлиники. Она направилась к своей машине, и я решила проследить за ней. Мое сердце билось сильнее, так как я была полна решимости провести этот вечер с ней, подождав пока она отъедет, я поехала за ней, оказавшись на трассе, я её обогнала и увидев в зеркало, что она едет за мной, я свернула на не освящённую парковку, заехав на неё, я заглушила двигатель, выключила свет фар и стала ждать её появления, заехав на парковку, выйдя из машины она стала искать меня в темноте, я решила с ней поиграть, говоря играющим голосом из темноты “Привет, красавица. Ты выглядишь потрясающе, как фотомодель. Я заметила тебя в поликлинике и не могу отвести от тебя глаз. Не хочешь провести со мной этот вечер? Я уверена, что у нас будет незабываемое время вместе.” Кто ты? спросила медсестра.Я твоя судьба, сказала я задумчиво. «Твоя судьба?» - повторила она с усмешкой. «Ты меня даже не знаешь». Она приблизилась ко мне, и я чувствовала, как ее дыхание становится все ближе. «Мы только что познакомились, и ты уже говоришь, что я твоя судьба? Это слишком быстро, не находишь?» «Может «Может быть, мы должны познакомиться лучше, прежде чем говорить о судьбе?» мы сели в мою машину, и в машине я решила её поцеловать на что она ответила и целуясь, нам вдруг постучала в окно красивая девушка, на что медсестра спросила может нам прерваться? но я сказала ей, не думай об этом, однако стук не прекращался, и я попросив её подождать меня в машине, вышла спросить что нужно этой наглой девушке, прервавший наш поцелуй, однако как только я вышла, она притянула меня к себе целуя стала толкать в свою машину, оказавшись в машине, продолжая поцелуй она сказала коему-то поехали и тут-же вернулась к моим губам, кто ты? куда нас везут? прерывая поцелуи, спрашивала я, а как же моя девушка медсестра и моя машина ? спросила я Кто ты? Куда нас везут? Где моя девушка медсестра и моя машина? - спрашивала я, перебивая поцелуи. Я начала понимать, что что-то не так и что она, возможно, не та, за кого себя выдает. Мои мысли взбудоражились, и я стала пытаться выбраться из ее объятий. Она сжимала мою руку сильнее и улыбалась, словно наслаждаясь моим смятением. Мое сердце колотилось от страха и ярости одновременно. Наконец, я смогла вырваться из ее хватки и выбежать из машины. Мои ноги несли меня, и я не оглядывалась. Мне было страшно, и я решила позвонить в полицию. Где-то вдалеке я услышала звук машин, но я не обращала на них внимания. Я бежала, пока не добрела до дома. Я заперлась внутри решив сразу уснуть, на утро меня разбудил стук в мою квартиру, увидев что это была похитительница, я сказала ей что это квартира моей девушке, у которой она пыталась меня увести с собой и что она скоро должна вернуться, в ответ она усмехнулась и сказала, что моя девушка больше не придет, потому что она уже у нее., я похитила её, когда она ехала домой. Это слова застряли в моем разбитом сердце, я не могла поверить в то, что моя девушка была похищена этой незнакомкой. Она подошла ко мне ближе, смотря мне прямо в глаза. Ее глаза теперь выглядели искаженными, полными безумия. Я почувствовала страх, который пронзил каждую клеточку моего тела. Она начала приближаться ко мне, и я отчаянно отстранилась от нее. “Кто ты на самом деле?” - закричала я, шаращая взглядом комнату, ища любую подсказку. “Что ты хочешь от меня?” Она лишь усмехнулась и подошла ближе. “Я твоя тайна, я твоя ночная кошмарка”, - прошептала она, насаживая свои глаза на мои. Но я не собиралась сдаваться. Попытавшись выбежать из квартиры, я попала в её объятия и она сильно схватила меня за руку, не давая мне уйти. Моя попытка сопротивления только разозлила ее больше, и она начала тащить меня обратно в комнату. Она с улыбкой, полной злобы, сказала: “Тебе некуда убежать, я уже управляю твоей судьбой. Ты стала интересом для меня, и я не отпущу тебя.” стала меня целовать И тут, внезапно, я проснулась. Весь этот ужасный сон оказался всего лишь кошмаром. Я была дома, спокойная и в безопасности. Потекла пот по моему лбу, и я осознала, что это всего лишь был сон, но его реалистичность оставила меня в трепете. Вздохнув с облегчением, я поняла, что никого нет рядом со мной, кто бы хотел навредить мне или управлять моей судьбой. Это была всего лишь иллюзия, созданная моим подсознанием. Я сделала глубокий вдох и медленно выдохнула, чтобы успокоить свои нервы. Этот кошмар прошел, и я была благодарна за свою безопасность и свободу. Проснувшись утром выйдя из дома, сев в машину, выехав на трассу я заметила что за мной едет незнакомая машина, увидев что это была похитительница, я попыталась ускориться. но она в меня врезалась, и я потеряла сознание, она тут-же подбежала ко мне взяв меня на руки, я прижалась к ней почувствовав её теплоту, поцеловала в шею , оставив след отпечатка губ на ее коже.

Постепенно приходя в себя, я осознала, что нахожусь в незнакомом месте. Посмотрев вокруг, я увидела, что нахожусь в темной и мрачной комнате. Вдалеке светило единственное окно, через которое проникали ледяные лучи света. Ощущая себя ослабевшей и с трудом двигаясь, я попыталась встать и исследовать свое окружение. Пробираясь через коридоры, я наткнулась на дверь, за которой я услышала знакомый голос. Это была медсестра из поликлиники. Сердце забилось от облегчения, я постучала в дверь и выразила свою радость, что нас вновь соединило судьба, но она, не выходя из комнаты, сказала, что все это было лишь иллюзией моего воображения. Моя радость обратилась в разочарование, и страх снова охватил меня. \\"Ты не должна здесь находиться\\" - прозвучал ее голос холодно. \\"Тебя сюда привели не случайно\\".

Select one that fits your skill level and budget. 2. **Design Concept:** Think about the mood and energy of your beat. Visual elements can include abstract shapes, waveforms, particle systems, or even simple animations that move to the beat of the music. Try to create something that encapsulates the feel of your track. 3. **Sync with the Beat:** Make sure that the visual elements react to the music. Most visualizer software will have an option to react to the audio spectrum or particular frequencies in the music, resulting in visuals that move in sync with the beat. 4. **Branding:** Include your artist name and the track title in the visualizer. This helps with branding and ensures that viewers can remember who you are and what the track is called. 5. **Resolution:** Keep in mind YouTube's preferred video formats and resolutions. HD (1920x1080) or higher is strongly recommended for quality. **Promoting Your Beat:** 1. **Release on Multiple Platforms:** Use a music distribution service (like DistroKid, TuneCore, or CD Baby) to release your beat on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and other platforms to maximize reach. 2. **Social Media Marketing:** Leverage social media platforms to share snippets of your visualizer. Use Instagram Stories, TikTok, and Twitter to give previews and drive traffic to your YouTube page or streaming platforms. 3. **Collaborate:** Collaborate with influencers or content creators who can showcase your beat in their videos. 4. **Playlists:** Try to get your beat featured on Spotify playlists, YouTube Music playlists, and other playlist services. There are both free and paid submission services to get your track reviewed by playlist curators. 5. **Ads:** Consider running targeted ads on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or Facebook to reach a wider audience. 6. **SEO:** When uploading your visualizer on YouTube, use relevant keywords in the title, description, and tags to improve the visibility of your video in search results. 7. **Email Marketing:** If you have a mailing list, use it to notify your subscribers about your new release. 8. **Engage with Your Listeners:** Interact with the audience in the comments section of your YouTube video and on other social media platforms. 9. **Press Release:** If you have the budget, consider putting out a press release about your new beat or visualizer to get coverage on music blogs and websites. 10. **Performances and Live Streams:** Perform live (if possible) to showcase your beat or host live stream sessions where you share your production process or have a Q&A session with fans. Remember that promoting music is a multipronged effort, and consistency is key. Keep engaging with your community, put out quality content regularly, and be patient as you build up your audience and presence in the industry."},{"prompt":"i dont want an audio visualizer, more of just visuals that keep looping for example","completion":"Creating a looping visual that complements your beat without it being a direct audio visualizer can be an artistic and compelling way to engage your audience. Here's how you might go about creating such a visual for YouTube: 1. **Concept Development**: Determine a concept or theme that resonates with the beat you have created. For instance, if your beat has a relaxed, chill vibe, you might opt for visuals of nature, like a serene landscape or an endless starry night sky. 2. **Source or Create Visuals**: You can film your own footage, use royalty-free stock video, create animations, or even design a sequence of images. Websites like Pixabay or Pexels Video provide high-quality visuals that you can legally use for free, often even for commercial purposes. 3. **Looping the Visual**: To create a seamless loop (so that the end and the beginning of the clip flow naturally into each other), you may need to do some video editing. This can often be done by reversing a clip and appending it to the end of the original, or by finding a natural point in the video where a cut won't be noticed. 4. **Editing Software**: Use video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or free alternatives like DaVinci Resolve or Shotcut to edit and loop your visuals. 5. **Effects and Transitions**: Add effects or transitions that subtly enhance the visual experience without distracting from the beat. The idea is to create a hypnotic and relaxing visual that can be watched for an extended period. 6. **Final Touches**: Ensure your branding is included, either as a static element in a corner or as an intro/outro. Also, ensure that the video resolution and format are optimized for YouTube (generally 1920x1080 or higher). Once the visual is ready and uploaded to YouTube, promotion is very similar to what you'd do for a full music video: - Share teasers and the final video on social media. - Engage with your followers and ask them to like, comment, and share. - Use relevant hashtags to increase the visibility of your posts. - Consider running targeted ads on YouTube and social media. - Pitch your track and visual to blogs and websites featuring music and new music videos. - Consider using YouTube's Premiere feature to create anticipation and gather your audience for a live first-watch experience. - Email your subscriber list with a link to the video and encourage them to spread the word. - Engage with your community and encourage them to use your beat (and possibly your visual) in their content, which can increase your reach. As with any release, patience and persistence are key. Building an audience takes time and continuous effort, so be consistently active and engaging with your fanbase."},{"prompt":"i need some ideas for the visualizer, and maybe even a good creative name for the beat (please make sure it doesnt sound corny). its an rnb-ish beat","completion":"Certainly! Coming up with the right visuals to accompany your R&B-ish beat can set the tone and engage your audience. I'll suggest some visual ideas and potential creative names for the track. **Visual Ideas:** 1. **City at Night**: Time-lapse footage of a city skyline at night, with lights flickering in the buildings and cars moving smoothly on the streets. The hustle and vibe of the city can complement the R&B rhythm. 2. **Celestial Motion**: A starscape with the gradual movement of celestial bodies, like a slowly spinning galaxy or moon phases, possibly reflecting the emotive nature of R&B. 3. **Abstract Art**: Flowing ink in water or digitally created abstract art that slowly morphs and changes colors, representing the fluidity and depth of the beat. 4. **Nature Elements**: Close-up, slow-motion shots of natural elements like water droplets rippling on a surface, leaves rustling in a gentle breeze, or waves softly crashing on a beach at sunset. 5. **Retro Vinyl**: A vinyl record playing on a turntable with a warm, nostalgic glow, which can evoke the roots of R&B music and its timeless appeal. 6. **Dancer's Silhouette**: A silhouette of a dancer slowly moving to the beat, highlighting the sensual and expressive quality of the genre. 7. **Neon Aesthetics**: Neon signs or shapes that pulse subtly to the rhythm of the beat, set against a dark backdrop for a sleek, modern feel. 8. **Urban Shadows**: Shadows of people and objects in an urban setting, cast on walls or pavements, subtly moving with the tempo of the music. **Creative Names for the Beat:** 1. \\"Midnight Groove\\" 2. \\"Celestial Slowjam\\" 3. \\"Velvet Pulse\\" 4. \\"Aurora Whispers\\" 5. \\"Silken Shadows\\" 6. \\"Twilight Echoes\\" 7. \\"Neon Breeze\\" 8. \\"Rhythm Mirage\\" 9. \\"Soulstice Drift\\" 10. \\"Hush Horizon\\" Choose visuals that you feel express something essential about the beat. The right visuals can create a powerful connection with the listener and enhance the overall experience of the music. And for the name, it should resonate with you as the creator, fitting the mood and feel of your work. Avoid names that are overly complex or gimmicky, as the ones suggested above aim to strike a balance between evocative and accessible without venturing into the territory of cliché."},{"prompt":"Divide two columns in Python","completion":"To divide two columns in Python, you can use the pandas library. Here's an example: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Create a DataFrame data = {'Column 1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'Column 2': [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Divide Column 1 by Column 2 and store the result in a new column 'Result' df['Result'] = df['Column 1'] / df['Column 2'] # Print the DataFrame print(df) \`\`\` Output: \`\`\` Column 1 Column 2 Result 0 1 6 0.166667 1 2 7 0.285714 2 3 8 0.375000 3 4 9 0.444444 4 5 10 0.500000 \`\`\` In this example, we first create a DataFrame with two columns ('Column 1' and 'Column 2'). Then, we use the division operator (\\"/\\") to divide 'Column 1' by 'Column 2' and store the result in a new column named 'Result'. Finally, we print the DataFrame to see the results."},{"prompt":"prezentez votre project devant la class ,contaient un reglemant a suavire dans l'immeuble ,containt conseils ,des enterdiction ou des obligation","completion":"Bonjour tout le monde, Aujourd'hui, je vais vous présenter notre projet pour améliorer la vie dans notre immeuble.
