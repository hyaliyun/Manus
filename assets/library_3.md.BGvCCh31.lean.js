If |f(z)| leq 1, then |g(z)| = 0. We can write g(z) as: g(z) = e^z - 1 - cos(z) = e^z - frac{e^{iz} + e^{-iz}}{2} - 1 = frac{2e^z - e^{iz} - e^{-iz} - 2}{2}. Let z = x + iy, where x and y are real numbers. Then we have: g(z) = frac{2e^x - e^{i(x+iy)} - e^{-i(x-iy)} - 2}{2} = frac{2e^x - e^{ix}e^{-y} - e^{-ix}e^y - 2}{2}. For |g(z)| = 0, we need both the real and imaginary parts of g(z) to be zero. The real part of g(z) is: operatorname{Re}(g(z)) = frac{2e^x - (e^{ix}e^{-y} + e^{-ix}e^y)}{2} = e^x - frac{e^{-y}(cos(x) + e^{2y}cos(x))}{2}. Setting this equal to zero, we get: e^x = frac{e^{-y}(cos(x) + e^{2y}cos(x))}{2}. Similarly, the imaginary part of g(z) is: operatorname{Im}(g(z)) = frac{-e^{ix}e^{-y} + e^{-ix}e^y}{2i} = frac{e^{-y}sin(x) - e^ysin(x)}{2i}. Setting this equal to zero, we get: e^{-y}sin(x) = e^ysin(x). From the equations above, we can see that there are no general solutions for x and y that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

Since g(z) is an entire function with no zeros and is constant on the unit circle, it must be constant everywhere by the Identity Theorem. Thus, g(z) = c for some constant c neq 0. Then, f(z) overline{f(bar{z})} = c, and we can define a new entire function F(z) = sqrt{c} f(z). Then, F(z) overline{F(bar{z})} = 1, so F(z) is a function that maps the complex conjugate of its argument to its reciprocal. Now, consider the function G(z) = F(z) F(bar{z}). Note that G(z) is also an entire function, and G(z) = 1 for all z. Thus, G(z) is a constant function, so F(z) = frac{1}{F(bar{z})} for all z. In particular, this implies that F(0) = frac{1}{F(0)}, so F(0) = pm 1. Finally, we can write F(z) = e^{i theta} f(z), where theta = arg(sqrt{c}). Then, f(z) = e^{-i theta} F(z), and |f(z)| = 1 whenever |z| = 1.

Let's test these possible roots: f(1) = 1^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 3 = 1 - 4 + 5 - 3 = -1 ≠ 1 f(-1) = (-1)^3 - 4(-1)^2 + 5(-1) - 3 = -1 - 4 - 5 - 3 ≠ 1 f(3) = 3^3 - 4(3)^2 + 5(3) - 3 = 27 - 36 + 15 - 3 = 3 ≠ 1 f(-3) = (-3)^3 - 4(-3)^2 + 5(-3) - 3 = -27 - 36 - 15 - 3 ≠ 1 None of the possible rational roots are solutions to the equation. Since the equation is a cubic, it must have at least one real root. We can use numerical methods, such as the Newton-Raphson method, to approximate the real root. The Newton-Raphson method requires the derivative of the function: f'(z) = 3z^2 - 8z + 5 We start with an initial guess for the root, say z_0 = 1. Then we iterate the following formula: z_n+1 = z_n - f(z_n) / f'(z_n) Let's perform a few iterations: z_1 = 1 - (1^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 3) / (3(1)^2 - 8(1) + 5) = 1 - (-1) / 0 = 1 (no change) Since the iteration didn't change the value of z, we have found the real root: z ≈ 1. Now, we can perform polynomial division to find the remaining quadratic factor: (z^3 - 4z^2 + 5z - 3) / (z - 1) = z^2 - 3z + 3 Now we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation: z^2 - 3z + 3 = 0 We can use the quadratic formula: z = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a In this case, a = 1, b = -3, and c = 3: z = (3 ± √((-3)^2 - 4(1)(3))) / 2(1) z = (3 ± √(9 - 12)) / 2 z = (3 ± √(-3)) / 2 The roots of the quadratic equation are complex: z = (3 ± i√3) / 2 So the values of z such that f(z) = 1 are: z ≈ 1, z = (3 + i√3) / 2, and z = (3 - i√3) / 2."},{"prompt":"ere's a question for a math student to solve related to Analytic Functions and their Properties: Let f(z) = 2z^2 + 3iz + 4 be an analytic function.

Then: f(z) = (2e^(iθ))² + i(2e^(iθ)) + 1 = 4e^(2iθ) + 2ie^(iθ) + 1 Now, let's find the magnitude of f(z): |f(z)| = |4e^(2iθ) + 2ie^(iθ) + 1| To simplify this expression, let's use the polar form of complex numbers: |f(z)| = |4(cos(2θ) + i*sin(2θ)) + 2i(cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)) + 1| = |(4cos(2θ) + 1) + (4sin(2θ) + 2sin(θ))i| Now we have the magnitude of f(z) in terms of θ: |f(z)|² = (4cos(2θ) + 1)² + (4sin(2θ) + 2sin(θ))² To find the maximum value of |f(z)|, we can find the maximum value of |f(z)|² (since the square root function is monotonic). We can do this by taking the derivative with respect to θ and setting it to zero: d(|f(z)|²)/dθ = 0 After taking the derivative and simplifying, we get: -32cos(θ)sin(θ) + 16sin(θ)cos(θ) - 8sin(θ) = 0 Divide by -8: 4cos(θ)sin(θ) - 2sin(θ)cos(θ) + sin(θ) = 0 sin(θ)(2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1) = 0 This gives us two possibilities: sin(θ) = 0 or 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0. The first case, sin(θ) = 0, corresponds to θ = 0 or θ = π. The second case, 2cos(θ) - cos(θ) + 1 = 0, corresponds to cos(θ) = 1/2, which gives θ = 2π/3 or θ = 4π/3.

The Laplacian of a scalar function in Cartesian coordinates is given by: nabla^2u = frac{partial^2u}{partial x^2} + frac{partial^2u}{partial y^2} nabla^2v = frac{partial^2v}{partial x^2} + frac{partial^2v}{partial y^2} Now, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are: frac{partial u}{partial x} = frac{partial v}{partial y} frac{partial u}{partial y} = -frac{partial v}{partial x} Differentiating the first Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to x, we get: frac{partial^2 u}{partial x^2} = frac{partial^2 v}{partial x partial y} Differentiating the second Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to y, we get: frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = -frac{partial^2 v}{partial y partial x} Adding these two equations, we obtain: nabla^2u = frac{partial^2 u}{partial x^2} + frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = frac{partial^2 v}{partial x partial y} - frac{partial^2 v}{partial y partial x} = 0 Similarly, differentiating the first Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to y, we get: frac{partial^2 v}{partial y^2} = -frac{partial^2 u}{partial x partial y} Differentiating the second Cauchy-Riemann equation with respect to x, we get: -frac{partial^2 v}{partial x^2} = frac{partial^2 u}{partial y partial x} Adding these two equations, we obtain: nabla^2v = frac{partial^2 v}{partial x^2} + frac{partial^2 v}{partial y^2} = -frac{partial^2 u}{partial x partial y} + frac{partial^2 u}{partial y partial x} = 0 Since both nabla^2u = 0 and nabla^2v = 0, we can conclude that the Laplacian of the complex-valued function f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) is also zero: nabla^2f = nabla^2(u + iv) = nabla^2u + inabla^2v = 0 + i0 = 0"},{"prompt":"Let phi(x,y) be a harmonic function defined on the disk D = {(x,y) in mathbb{R}^2 : x^2+y^2 < 1} such that phi(x,y) = x on the circle x^2+y^2 = 1.

Since phi(x, y) = x on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 1, we can use polar coordinates to simplify the problem. Let x = rcostheta and y = rsintheta. Then, the given condition becomes phi(rcostheta, rsintheta) = rcostheta for r = 1. Now, we can express phi in polar coordinates as phi(r, theta) = R(r)Theta(theta). The Laplace's equation in polar coordinates is given by: Delta phi = frac{1}{r}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial phi}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2}frac{partial^2 phi}{partial theta^2} = 0. Substituting phi(r, theta) = R(r)Theta(theta), we get: frac{1}{r}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial (RTheta)}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2}frac{partial^2 (RTheta)}{partial theta^2} = 0. Dividing by R(r)Theta(theta), we obtain: frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) + frac{1}{r^2Theta}frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = 0. Since the left side is a function of r and the right side is a function of theta, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let this constant be -k^2. Then, we have two ordinary differential equations: 1. frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) = -k^2. 2. frac{1}{Theta}frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = k^2. Solving the second equation, we get: frac{partial^2 Theta}{partial theta^2} = k^2Theta. The general solution is: Theta(theta) = Acos(ktheta) + Bsin(ktheta). Since phi is a harmonic function, it must be single-valued. This implies that Theta(theta + 2pi) = Theta(theta). Therefore, k = n for some integer n. Thus, we have: Theta_n(theta) = A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta). Now, let's solve the first equation: frac{1}{rR}frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) = -n^2. Multiplying by rR, we get: frac{partial}{partial r}left(rfrac{partial R}{partial r}right) = -n^2rR. Integrating with respect to r, we obtain: rfrac{partial R}{partial r} = -n^2int rR dr + C_1. Dividing by r and integrating again, we get: R(r) = -frac{n^2}{2}int rR dr + C_1ln r + C_2. The general solution for R(r) is: R_n(r) = C_{1n}r^n + C_{2n}r^{-n}. Thus, the general solution for phi in polar coordinates is: phi(r, theta) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} (C_{1n}r^n + C_{2n}r^{-n})(A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta)). Now, we use the given condition phi(rcostheta, rsintheta) = rcostheta for r = 1. This gives: sum_{n=1}^{infty} (C_{1n} + C_{2n})(A_ncos(ntheta) + B_nsin(ntheta)) = costheta. Comparing the coefficients of costheta and sintheta, we get: C_{1n}A_n + C_{2n}A_n = delta_{n1}, C_{1n}B_n + C_{2n}B_n = 0. Here, delta_{n1} is the Kronecker delta, which is equal to 1 if n = 1 and 0 otherwise. Since B_n = 0 for all n, we have: C_{1n}A_n + C_{2n}A_n = delta_{n1} Rightarrow A_n(C_{1n} + C_{2n}) = delta_{n1}. Thus, A_1 = 1 and A_n = 0 for n neq 1. Therefore, the solution for phi is: phi(r, theta) = (C_{11}r + C_{21}r^{-1})costheta. Finally, we want to find the value of phi(0, 0). Since phi is a harmonic function, it is continuous. Therefore, we can take the limit as r to 0: phi(0, 0) = lim_{r to 0} (C_{11}r + C_{21}r^{-1})costheta = C_{11} cdot 0 + C_{21} cdot infty cdot costheta. However, this limit is not well-defined, as it depends on the value of theta. This implies that the harmonic function phi(x, y) cannot satisfy the given condition.

Since u(x,y) is harmonic, it satisfies Laplace's equation: ∇²u = ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = 0. Substituting u(x,y) = X(x)Y(y) into the equation, we get: X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 0. Now, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y): X''(x)/X(x) + Y''(y)/Y(y) = 0. Since the left side is a function of x and the right side is a function of y, both sides must be equal to a constant. Let's call this constant -λ: X''(x)/X(x) = -λ and Y''(y)/Y(y) = λ. Now, we have two ordinary differential equations: 1) X''(x) + λX(x) = 0, 2) Y''(y) - λY(y) = 0. We need to solve these equations with the given boundary conditions: u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 1 => X(x) = 1/Y(0), u(0,y) = X(0)Y(y) = 0 => X(0) = 0, u(1,y) = X(1)Y(y) = ln(y+1) => X(1) = ln(y+1)/Y(y).

Applying the boundary condition X(0) = 0, we get: 0 = A*sin(0) + B*cos(0) => B = 0. So, X(x) = A*sin(√λx). Now, let's solve the second equation: Y''(y) - λY(y) = 0. For λ > 0, the general solution is: Y(y) = C*cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy). Applying the boundary condition u(x,0) = 1, we get: 1 = X(x)/Y(0) => Y(0) = X(x) => C = 1. So, Y(y) = cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy). Now, we need to find λ and D such that u(1,y) = ln(y+1). This gives us: ln(y+1) = A*sin(√λ) * (cosh(√λy) + D*sinh(√λy)). This equation must hold for all 0 < y < 1. This is only possible if we have an infinite series of terms, each of which satisfies the equation for a specific λ_n and D_n.

We can rewrite the expression for f(e^{itheta}) as: f(e^{itheta}) = frac{2sintheta}{2-2costheta} + ifrac{2sinthetacostheta}{2-2costheta} Let u(theta) = frac{2sintheta}{2-2costheta} and v(theta) = frac{2sinthetacostheta}{2-2costheta}. Then, the image of the unit circle under the mapping is given by the set of points (u(theta), v(theta)) as theta varies from 0 to 2pi. Now, we can use the Schwarz reflection principle to analytically continue the function f(z) across the unit circle. Since f(z) is analytic on the unit disk |z| < 1 and continuous up to the boundary, we can reflect the function values across the unit circle by setting: f^*(z) = overline{f(bar{z})} where f^*(z) is the analytic continuation of f(z) across the unit circle, and bar{z} is the complex conjugate of z. Then, the image of the unit circle under the mapping f^*(z) is given by the set of points (u^*(theta), v^*(theta)) as theta varies from 0 to 2pi, where: u^*(theta) = frac{2sintheta}{2+2costheta} v^*(theta) = -frac{2sinthetacostheta}{2+2costheta} Thus, the image of the unit circle under the mapping f(z) using the Schwarz reflection principle is given by the union of the sets of points (u(theta), v(theta)) and (u^*(theta), v^*(theta)) as theta varies from 0 to 2pi."},{"prompt":"A mathematical student has studied Schwarz reflection principle and its applications in complex analysis.

Then: |f(e^(iθ))| = |(ae^(iθ) + 1/2) / (ce^(iθ) + 1)| = 1 We can simplify this expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: |f(e^(iθ))| = |(ae^(iθ) + 1/2)(1 - ce^(-iθ))| / |1 - ce^(iθ)||1 - ce^(-iθ)| = 1 Expanding the numerator, we get: |f(e^(iθ))| = |ae^(iθ) - ace^(-iθ) + 1/2 - 1/2ce^(-iθ)| = 1 Now, let's consider the case when θ = 0: |f(1)| = |a - ac + 1/2 - 1/2c| = 1 Since f(1) is on the boundary of the unit disk, we must have |a - ac + 1/2 - 1/2c| = 1. We can rewrite this as: |a(1 - c) + 1/2(1 - c)| = 1 Now, let's consider the case when θ = π: |f(-1)| = |-a - ac - 1/2 + 1/2c| = 1 Since f(-1) is also on the boundary of the unit disk, we must have |-a - ac - 1/2 + 1/2c| = 1. We can rewrite this as: |-a(1 + c) - 1/2(1 - c)| = 1 Comparing the two equations, we can see that they are the same if we set c = -1. Then, the Möbius transformation becomes: f(z) = (az + 1/2) / (-z + 1) Now we need to find the value of a. Since f(0) = 1/2, we have: 1/2 = (a * 0 + 1/2) / (-0 + 1) This equation is already satisfied, so we don't need to change the value of a.

Substituting this back into the Möbius transformation, we get: f(z) = frac{az - ai}{az - ai} Now, we can simplify this expression: f(z) = frac{a(z - i)}{a(z - i)} = 1 This is not the desired conformal map, so we need to modify our approach. Instead of mapping 1 to 1, let's map -1 to 1. Plugging in z = -1, we get: f(-1) = frac{-a - ai}{-a - ai} = 1 This implies that a = i. Substituting this back into the Möbius transformation, we get: f(z) = frac{iz - i^2}{iz + 1} = frac{iz + 1}{iz + 1} = 1 This is still not the desired conformal map. However, we can compose this map with another Möbius transformation that maps 1 to infinity and 0 to 1.

Consider the Möbius transformation given by: f(z) = (z - i)/(z + i). We can check that f is biholomorphic and maps the unit disk D to the upper half-plane H. First, let's verify that f maps D to H. Take any z ∈ D, i.e., |z| < 1. Then: f(z) = (z - i)/(z + i) = ((z - i)(z̅ + i))/(z + i)(z̅ + i) = (z² + iz - iz̅ - 1)/(z² + 2iz + 1).

The Möbius transformation f(z) is holomorphic since it is a composition of holomorphic functions (addition, multiplication, and division). To show that f is bijective, we need to find its inverse. Let g(w) be the inverse of f, i.e., g(f(z)) = z and f(g(w)) = w. Then: z = g((z - i)/(z + i)) and w = f(g(w)) = (g(w) - i)/(g(w) + i). Solving for g(w), we get: g(w) = (w + i)/(1 - iw).

The Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of such a map, but we need to find it explicitly. Consider the Möbius transformation T(z) = frac{z - frac{i}{2}}{1 - frac{i}{2}z}.

To find the maximum value of |f(e^{itheta})|^2, we can differentiate with respect to costheta and set the derivative to zero: frac{d}{d(costheta)} frac{4cos^2theta + 4costheta + 1}{2 - 2costheta} = 0. Solving this equation, we find that the maximum value of |f(e^{itheta})|^2 occurs at costheta = frac{1}{2}. Substituting this value back into the expression for |f(e^{itheta})|^2, we get: |f(e^{itheta})|^2_{text{max}} = frac{4left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 4left(frac{1}{2}right) + 1}{2 - 2left(frac{1}{2}right)} = 3.

To map the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane, we can use the following Möbius transformation: f(z) = i * (z + 1) / (1 - z) Let's verify that this transformation maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane: 1. f(0) = i * (0 + 1) / (1 - 0) = i, which is in the upper half plane. 2. If |z| < 1 (inside the unit circle), then |1 - z| > 0. Thus, the denominator is nonzero, and the transformation is well-defined. 3. The imaginary part of f(z) is positive for z inside the unit circle. To see this, let z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers and |z| < 1. Then: f(z) = i * (x + yi + 1) / (1 - x - yi) = i * (x + 1 + yi) / (1 - x - yi) Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, we get: f(z) = i * (x + 1 + yi) * (1 - x + yi) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2) = i * ((x + 1)(1 - x) + y^2 + y(x + 1 - x^2 + y^2)) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2) The imaginary part of f(z) is: Im(f(z)) = (x + 1 - x^2 + y^2) / ((1 - x)^2 + y^2) Since |z| < 1, we have x^2 + y^2 < 1, and thus: Im(f(z)) > 0 This shows that f(z) maps the inside of the unit circle to the upper half plane. 4. The transformation is bijective. To see this, we can find its inverse: f_inv(w) = (w - i) / (w + i) It's easy to verify that f(f_inv(w)) = w and f_inv(f(z)) = z, which shows that the transformation is bijective.

Thus, we can choose a=b=2i, and our Möbius transformation becomes w = frac{z-2i}{z-2i} = 1. Now, we need to find a Möbius transformation that maps the real axis to the unit circle.

The general solution of the first ODE is: X(x) = Acos(sqrt{lambda}x) + Bsin(sqrt{lambda}x) Applying the boundary conditions, we get: X(0) = Acos(0) + Bsin(0) = A = 1 X(1) = cos(sqrt{lambda}) + Bsin(sqrt{lambda}) = 0 From the second equation, we have: Bsin(sqrt{lambda}) = -cos(sqrt{lambda}) Since B neq 0, we have: sin(sqrt{lambda}) = -frac{1}{B}cos(sqrt{lambda}) Squaring both sides and using the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we get: lambda = (npi)^2, quad n = 1,2,3,... Now, we solve the second ODE: Y''(y) - lambda Y(y) = 0 The general solution is: Y(y) = C_ncosh(npi y) + D_nsinh(npi y) Applying the boundary conditions, we get: u(x,0) = X(x)Y(0) = 1 u(x,1) = X(x)Y(1) = 0 This implies that Y(0) = 1 and Y(1) = 0. From the first condition, we have: C_n = 1 From the second condition, we have: sinh(npi) = 0 However, this is not possible since sinh(x) neq 0 for x neq 0. Therefore, we must have D_n = 0. Thus, the solution for Y(y) is: Y(y) = cosh(npi y) Now, we can write the solution for u(x,y) as a sum of the product of X(x) and Y(y): u(x,y) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} X_n(x)Y_n(y) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} left[A_ncos(npi x) + B_nsin(npi x)right]cosh(npi y) Applying the boundary condition u(x,0) = 1, we get: 1 = sum_{n=1}^{infty} A_ncos(npi x) Using the orthogonality of cosine functions, we can find A_n: A_n = int_0^1 cos(npi x) dx = frac{2}{npi} quad text{for odd n} A_n = 0 quad text{for even n} Finally, the solution for u(x,y) is: u(x,y) = sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{infty} frac{2}{npi}cos(npi x)cosh(npi y)"},{"prompt":"Consider the following partial differential equation: (1 + i) frac{partial u}{partial x} - (1 - i) frac{partial u}{partial y} = 2 + 2i with initial conditions u(x, 0) = cos(x) and u(0, y) = e^{iy}.

Now, we can find the characteristic curves for u_r: frac{dx}{1} = frac{dy}{-1} = frac{du_r}{2} Integrating the first two ratios, we get x + y = c_1, where c_1 is a constant. Now, integrating the first and third ratios, we get u_r - 2x = c_2(c_1), where c_2(c_1) is a function of c_1. Using the initial condition u_r(x, 0) = cos(x), we have: cos(x) - 2x = c_2(x) Thus, u_r(x, y) = 2x + cos(x + y).

Then, we have: frac{partial^2 u}{partial x^2} = X''(x)Y(y) and frac{partial^2 u}{partial y^2} = X(x)Y''(y). Plugging these into the given PDE, we get: X''(x)Y(y) + X(x)Y''(y) = 2e^{2x}cos(y). Now, divide both sides by X(x)Y(y): frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} + frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = frac{2e^{2x}cos(y)}{X(x)Y(y)}. Since the left side is a function of x only and the right side is a function of x and y, we can separate the equation into two ordinary differential equations (ODEs): frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = 2e^{2x} + lambda and frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = cos(y) - lambda, where lambda is a separation constant. Now, let's solve the ODEs. For the X(x) equation: X''(x) - (2e^{2x} + lambda)X(x) = 0. This is a linear homogeneous ODE with variable coefficients, which is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can make an educated guess for the solution: X(x) = e^{ax}, where a is a constant to be determined. Plugging this into the ODE, we get: a^2 e^{ax} - (2e^{2x} + lambda)e^{ax} = 0. Dividing by e^{ax}, we have: a^2 - 2e^{2x} - lambda = 0. Since this equation must hold for all x, we must have a^2 = lambda. Thus, X(x) = e^{sqrt{lambda}x}. Now, let's solve the Y(y) equation: Y''(y) - (cos(y) - lambda)Y(y) = 0. This is a Sturm-Liouville problem. We can solve it using the eigenfunction expansion method. The eigenfunctions are given by: Y_n(y) = sin(ny), where n = 1, 2, 3, dots. The corresponding eigenvalues are: lambda_n = n^2.

To find the coefficients a_n, we use the boundary conditions: 1) u(x, 0) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n e^{sqrt{n^2}x}sin(0) = 0. This boundary condition is automatically satisfied. 2) u(x, pi) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n e^{sqrt{n^2}x}sin(npi) = 0. This boundary condition is also automatically satisfied since sin(npi) = 0 for all integer values of n. 3) u_x(-1, y) = sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n sqrt{n^2} e^{-sqrt{n^2}}sin(ny) = e^{2pi}cos(y). To find the coefficients a_n, we can use the orthogonality property of the sine functions: int_0^pi sin(ny)sin(my) dy = frac{pi}{2}delta_{nm}, where delta_{nm} is the Kronecker delta. Multiply both sides of the equation by sin(my) and integrate from 0 to pi: int_0^pi sum_{n=1}^{infty} a_n sqrt{n^2} e^{-sqrt{n^2}}sin(ny)sin(my) dy = int_0^pi e^{2pi}cos(y)sin(my) dy.

Plugging this into the equation, we get: n(n-1)r^(n-2) + (n-1)r^(n-2) + (3 - λ)r^(n-2) = 0 This equation holds for all r if and only if n(n-1) + n-1 + 3 - λ = 0. Solving for λ, we get λ = n² + 2n.

We have: u(cos(θ), sin(θ)) = R_2(sin(θ))Θ_2(θ) + R_4(sin(θ))Θ_4(θ) = e^(4iθ) + e^(2iθ) Comparing the coefficients of e^(inθ), we get: R_2(sin(θ))Θ_2(θ) = e^(2iθ) R_4(sin(θ))Θ_4(θ) = e^(4iθ) Since Θ_2(θ) = A_2*cos(2θ) + B_2*sin(2θ) and Θ_4(θ) = A_4*cos(4θ) + B_4*sin(4θ), we can see that A_2 = 0, B_2 = 1, A_4 = 1, and B_4 = 0. Thus, we have: Θ_2(θ) = sin(2θ) Θ_4(θ) = cos(4θ) Finally, the solution to the given partial differential equation with the given boundary conditions is: u(r, θ) = r^2*sin(2θ) + r^4*cos(4θ)"},{"prompt":"Determine the complex solution of the partial differential equation: ∂u/∂x + i∂u/∂y = 5 Given that u(0,y) = 2 + 3i for all real numbers y.","completion":"To solve the given partial differential equation (PDE), we can use the method of characteristics.

According to the residue theorem, the integral of a function over a closed contour is equal to 2pi i times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour. In this case, the pole z = x + i is inside the contour, so we need to find the residue of g(z) at this pole. To find the residue, we can use the formula for the residue of a simple pole: text{Res}(g(z), x + i) = lim_{z to x + i} (z - (x + i))g(z) text{Res}(g(z), x + i) = lim_{z to x + i} frac{f(z)}{(z-x)^2 + 1} (z - (x + i)) text{Res}(g(z), x + i) = lim_{z to x + i} frac{f(z)}{z - (x - i)} text{Res}(g(z), x + i) = frac{f(x + i)}{2i} Now, we can use the residue theorem to evaluate the integral: int_{-infty}^{infty} g(t) dt = 2pi i cdot text{Res}(g(z), x + i) = 2pi i cdot frac{f(x + i)}{2i} = pi f(x + i) Substituting this back into the integral equation, we get: f(x) - x = lambda pi f(x + i) Now, we can solve for f(x): f(x) = frac{x}{1 - lambda pi i} This is the solution to the integral equation using complex analysis techniques. Note that the function f(x) is complex-valued, which is expected since we used complex analysis techniques to solve the problem."},{"prompt":"Evaluate the following complex integral along the unit circle: ∫(z^2 + 4z - 5)/(z - 2i) dz where the unit circle is given by z = e^(it) with t ∈ [0, 2π].","completion":"To evaluate the complex integral, we will use the Cauchy Integral Formula. First, we need to check if the singularity (2i) is inside the unit circle. Since the unit circle has a radius of 1 and the singularity is at a distance of 2 from the origin, the singularity is outside the unit circle. The Cauchy Integral Formula states that for a function f(z) that is analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, and a point a inside C: ∫(f(z)/(z-a)) dz = 2πif(a) In our case, f(z) = z^2 + 4z - 5, and the singularity a = 2i is outside the unit circle. Therefore, the integral is equal to 0: ∫(z^2 + 4z - 5)/(z - 2i) dz = 0"},{"prompt":"A possible problem for a math student to solve in Complex analysis of integral equations is: Calculate the value of the following integral: int_{0}^{2pi} frac{cos{theta}}{5 - 4cos{theta}} dtheta Hints: 1. Use the substitution z=e^{itheta} to transform the integral into a contour integral in the complex plane. 2. Consider the contour C that is the unit circle centered at the origin with positive orientation. 3.
