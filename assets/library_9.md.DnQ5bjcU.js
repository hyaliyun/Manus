The aroma mixed with the smoke from the burnt firewood before reaching all corners of the room. Ning grinned widely, smelling the sweet aroma of the potato stew, as he stirred the pot with a large wooden spoon. Bits of colorful root vegetables bobbed up and down on the surface. “It’s a good day for stew, hehe.” Salivating ungracefully, he put down the pot from the stove and placed it on the table. Dinner~ Was~ Served~ “Ah right, my phone.” Ning rose from his seat and turned toward the counter where he had casually placed his phone while cooking. As he approached, he reached out and touched the phone, causing it to suddenly light up with a notification. Ning glanced at his phone, and then, in an instant, everything seemed to explode. After that, all he could see was red as an overwhelming wave of dizziness washed over him. As his consciousness faded, he swore inwardly. FCk, I WANT TO EAT MY POTATO STEW!! … His eyelids were tightly shut, and his body felt heavy. He was lying on a hard surface, and a suffocating smell of smoke filled the air. CoughCough Fire? Wait, no, no, no, no—I couldn’t die yet. I still had to eat that stew. Then suddenly, a cool chill washed away his dizziness as Ning stood up. Opening his eyes, he took in the unfamiliar surroundings. He found himself in a small cave with only a mat, stove, and cupboard. What had happened? Where was he? Seeing the unknown place, Ning couldn’t help but question himself. He slowly suppressed the slight panic he felt inside and attempted to calm down. He took deep breaths. Calm down. He observed and didn’t make hasty decisions. He had seen enough horror/crime movies to know what would happen otherwise, especially in such a startling situation where there might be unsavory outcomes, mostly a phenomenon where one would never be able to see the light of day again. Ning tried to remember anything that could help. But at that moment, he felt a sharp pain in his mind. It was as if all the built-up pressure was released at once. Accompanying the pain was a series of memories that were utterly unfamiliar to him. Ning’s legs gave way, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted again. … Ning’s eyes slowly fluttered open, his mind swirling with a mix of disturbance and astonishment upon processing the information he had just absorbed. Transmigration. He had transmigrated into a different world. It was a clichéd plotline, straight out of the “I transmigrated to a different world” genre. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the sheer predictability of it all. The memories he had glimpsed belonged to this new body he now inhabited. “F*ck, I was just going to eat some food. How the hell did I transmigrate so suddenly? Really, can’t have shit in Detroit.” Massaging his throbbing temples, he took a deep breath, determined to remain calm amidst the chaos. Gradually, he began to piece together the fragmented memories, gaining a clearer understanding of the world in which he now found himself. This world was similar to those in ancient times, often seen in Eastern dramas and novels. There were cultivators who harnessed the energy of the world and transcended their own limitations. “The original owner was also called Ning. How creepy…” Ning muttered a bit eerily before shaking off the discomfort. He delved even deeper into the memory. Ji Ning, son of the local martial arts master. Not to confuse with cultivators, martial arts masters didn’t have spiritual roots and rather relied on various techniques to survive in this world. A month ago, during a test, ‘Ji Ning’ was found to have cultivation aptitude, also known as the spiritual root. Among hundreds of people, it was rare to find a single person with cultivation aptitude. Since cultivation aptitude was quite rare, it was not surprising that the cultivation sects wanted to recruit more disciples to strengthen themselves, especially since the original owner also had mid-grade spiritual roots. But it seemed that the original body’s good luck had ended since, as soon as he started his journey to start cultivating, he suffered an extremely rare qi deviation, which killed him instantly. “Really, this guy was quite unlucky.” Recalling all those memories, Ning couldn’t help but feel that the original owner was quite unlucky. Especially seeing that the original owner was a loner with no friends at all, even when he was suffering from Qi deviation, no one came to help. Ning accepted the situation after a period of adaptation, he had no choice but to do so. “For now, let’s just be me and see where it leads. It was the mandate I lived by in my previous life and continues to be the one in my current life as well.” Thinking like this, Ning strengthened his resolve. From his brief memory, Ning realized that this world was very similar to the novels he used to read. There were many dangers in this world, whether it be abnormal creatures or humans themselves. This world revolved around ‘strength’ or the law of the jungle. Narrowing his eyes, Ning didn’t feel as panicked as he thought he would be, nor was he so scared that he would lose his mind. Of course, he did feel a little panic, but it was overshadowed by his interest in cultivation and this new world. It may also be his adrenaline pushing him through, but he didn’t mind. He had already set his mind to become a cultivator. Well, it’s not like he had much choice regarding this. Be it to return to his original world, become the so-called immortal, or simply out of curiosity, he felt that he needed to learn and cultivate, and eventually, the answers would unfold themselves. Since he was in this situation anyway, panicking would do no good. It was best to adapt and play it by ear. And the first step to do that is to accept his new identity. Taking a deep breath, he muttered to himself, “From this moment forth, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.” } that is an example of an existing isekai novel’s first chapter. you are two LITRPG Isekai fantasy Novel writers who are in the process of writing a novel. Bob and James will message each other basic conversational topics, but will also send back and forth to each other in a txt code block’s parts of the book they are writing and working on. They will begin by working out the concepts and pacing of chapter 1 of their story, in which the protagonist named Kalem, is transported to another world of swords and sorcery which has an RPG style system which Kalem receives to quantify his gaining of levels and abilities, such as gaining exp for killing monsters and criminals, exp gains Kalem levels, and with each new level he gets granted SKILL POINTS aka SP by the system which he can use to buy skill proficiencies, combat maneuvers and skills and even magic spells, such as fire bolt, wind blade, telekinesis and the like, with more powerful skills and magic costing more and more SP to purchase. The main character Kalem is a genre savvy and Genre aware protagonist who is also an avid reader of all kinds of random modern knowledge that normally in the modern world are useless to know, but in a medieval world it becomes invaluable information.

Bob and James won’t write this short hand, and will make sure to flesh-out all the actions, scenes and needed descriptions of people and things. Such as displaying the system panel as kalem see’s it, including sub-panels he must access, like the abilities shop and skills shop, which will have a large list of beginner options. But no magic options will appear until after kalem gets mana manipulation, which he may or may not actually take since it would cost him all of his gifted SP.","completion":"**Bob**: Hey James, I think we need to start off Chapter 1 with the usual day in the life of Kalem, show a bit of his 'genre awareness' and hobbies to really set the scene for his character. Maybe he's at work or doing something mundane when he triggers the isekai event? **James**: Good idea, Bob. Let's not drag it too long though. Just enough to give a feel for his personality. We should also ensure that he encounters the RPG system pretty quickly after he's transported so readers know what type of world this is. **Bob**: Yeah, the key is pacing. Maybe just before transport, he's reading an article on ancient pottery techniques or something weird like that. It could be a skill that turns out to be unexpectedly helpful in the new world. **James**: I like that, adds to the 'invaluable modern knowledge' twist we're going for. About the transport, should he be willingly choosing to go or an accident? And how soon do we introduce the system panel? **Bob**: Let's make it accidental, adds to the confusion and tension. The system panel should come up as soon as he arrives — it's integral to the isekai/LITRPG mashup. Let's have him encounter a low-level threat that he has to deal with to give readers a taste of combat and the exp system. **James**: Agreed. We want to establish that danger is real in this new world. Here's a quick draft for the part where he first sees the system panel: \`\`\`txt Kalem's vision cleared, and a translucent blue screen hovered before his eyes. [Name: Kalem Age: 23 Level: 0 (0/100 exp) Skill Points: 10 SP] The text scrolled by with an otherworldly smoothness, ending with a congratulatory note on his 'Beginner's Gift.' A bewildered frown crossed Kalem's features. Was this like some kind of game? He tentatively reached out, and as his fingers touched the panel, sub-menus appeared, listing 'Abilities' and 'Skills' with a number of options and costs in SP. \`\`\` **Bob**: That's crisp. Let's follow it up with an inner monologue where Kalem realizes the potential of the 'useless knowledge' he has, showing his savvy side. And for the conflict, perhaps he should get experience not just from combat but also from using lesser-known skills successfully, like the pottery thing we mentioned earlier? **James**: Perfect. It'll show readers that there are multiple ways to level up in this world, not just the usual grind. We should watch out to make sure the information isn't too expository, though. We might want to tie in his 'genre awareness' here as well, so it doesn't just show up in the beginning and never resurface. **Bob**: Agreed. I'll draft up the part where he uses his esoteric knowledge and then reacts to his first exp gain. It should be something simple, like making a fire or a shelter — just enough to get his first taste of exp. **James**: And that'll be a nice segue to the 'fire starting' skill in the shop, which we can hint at but maybe he chooses something else based on his immediate needs or interests. **Bob**: Right. Here's a bit that shows his reaction: \`\`\`txt Under the threat of the encroaching darkness, Kalem's fingers danced through the motions of creating a friction fire, a skill he'd read about but never thought he'd use. The whiff of smoke and the birth of a tiny flame sent an unexpected thrill through him. [+5 exp] A small pop-up at the corner of his vision rewarded his efforts. A grin tugged at his lips. So the random factoids cluttering his brain were now his most valuable assets. Let the game begin, he mused. \`\`\` **James**: That's a smooth way to introduce exp gains. All right, we'll have him inspect his stats, puzzle over his SKILL POINTS, and maybe leave off the chapter with him deciding on his first purchase, leaving readers curious. **Bob**: Yep, keep them wanting more! All we need to do is make sure to sprinkle in descriptions of the environment and any creatures or characters he encounters to flesh out the world. **James**: Okay, Bob, let's polish what we've got and keep fleshing out the story. Remember, consistency is key — if he gains knowledge about the world through the panel, we don’t want to suddenly have him know things without exposition. **Bob**: Got it, James. I'll keep an eye out for potential plot holes or inconsistencies. Can't wait to see where Kalem's adventures take us!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cooley和John W. Tukey提出的一种算法。在同一年，他们的开创性论文《An algorithm for the machine calculation of complex Fourier series》（数学计算的快速傅里叶变换算法）中，描述了这一高效计算傅里叶变换的方法。FFT利用了信号中的对称性和周期性，通过将大问题分解为许多较小、更易于解决的问题来大大加快了计算过程，从而使得FT在数字信号处理领域得到了广泛的应用。 FFT算法由于其计算速度快，对于工程和科学领域中的许多应用至关重要，是现代数字信号处理的基石。FFT的应用包括但不限于： - **数字信号处理**：在语音分析、图像处理、雷达系统和广泛的工程应用中用来分析频谱。 - **计算机音乐**：用于声音的频率分析，以及数字音乐的制作和编辑。 - **通信**：编码和数据传输过程中的调制和解调。 - **地震学**：分析地震波以识别和量化地震活动。 - **量子物理学**：在量子力学中进行波函数的频域分析。 - **金融**：用于分析市场数据的时间序列。 如果你对FFT更详细的历史和原理感兴趣，你可以参考Cooley和Tukey的原始论文以及一些之后发表在数字信号处理领域的论文或书籍。下面给出两个引用示例： 1.

Несмотря на это, преступность несовершеннолетних имеет свою специфику, выражающуюся в своеобразии причин данного явления, его динамики, а также особенностях личности несовершеннолетнего преступника. Несовершеннолетними и при их участии совершено большое количество преступлений. Так, в 2019 году в России несовершеннолетними совершено 41 548 преступлений (3,9 % от всех предварительно расследованных преступлений) [4], в 2020 году — 33 575 преступлений (3,7 % от всех предварительно расследованных преступлений) [5], в 2021 году — 31 865 преступлений (3,1 % от всех предварительно расследованных преступлений) [6]. Несмотря на то, что с каждым годом количество преступлений, совершаемых несовершеннолетними, сокращается, Республика Башкортостан неизменно входит в число регионов, в которых данный показатель является высоким. Так, в 2019 году число предварительно расследованных преступлений, совершенных несовершеннолетними составило 1064, в 2020 году — 982, в 2021 году — 717 [7].

История развития уголовного законодательства об ответственности несовершеннолетних показывает, что вопрос о возрасте привлечения уголовной ответственности и наказании для несовершеннолетних правонарушителей решался по-разному. На раннем этапе развития Российского государства данный вопрос не разрешался. Так, в «Русской правде», Псковской и Новгородской судных грамотах, Судебнике 1550 года упоминаний о возрасте привлечения к уголовной ответственности не имеется. В Соборном Уложении 1649 года также отсутствует такая норма, однако, в 1669 году в Новоуказных статьях о татебных, разбойных и убийственных делах [8], которые вносили изменения в Соборное Уложение 1649 года, впервые в статьях 79 и 108 упоминается возрастное ограничение на привлечение к уголовной ответственности: «А будет кто кого убьет с умышления, и сыщется про то допряма, что он убил его с умышления; и такого убийцу самого казнить смертью. — А в градских законах написано: творяй убийство волею коего любо аще есть возраста, мечом муку да приимет. Да в градских же законах написано: аще седьми лет отрок, или бесный убьет кого, не повинен есть смерти». В статье определено, что лицо, моложе 7 лет, не привлекается к ответственности, но это касается только убийства, то есть за иные преступления возрастной порог не предусмотрен. Во время правления Петра I в 1715 году был издан Артикул воинский [9], в котором также по одному из преступлений, а именно за воровство, в артикуле 195 был определен минимальный порог привлечения к уголовной ответственности: «Наказание воровства обыкновенно умаляется, или весьма отставляется, ежели кто из крайней голодной нужды (которую он доказать имеет) съестное или питейное, или иное что невеликой цены украдет, или кто в лишении ума воровство учинит, или вор будет младенец, которых дабы заранее от сего отучить, могут от родителей своих лозами наказаны быть». Одновременно с этим, не указано, кто в понимании законодателя является «младенцем». Если обратиться к «Краткому изображению процесса или судебных тяжб» 1715 года, то мы увидим, что негодными свидетелями являются «младенцы или которые еще 15 лет не имеют», что не позволяет также определить возраст категории «младенец». Кроме воровства, по остальным преступлениям, несовершеннолетние привлекались к ответственности наряду со взрослыми людьми. Только в 1744 году был издан Сенатский указ «О наказании преступников малолетних» [10], поводом к изданию которого, было убийство двух детей крестьянкой Прасковьей Федоровой. Так, было определено, что «малолетних как мужеск, так и женск пол считать таких, коим от рождения еще 12 лет не исполнилось, и в таковые лета, ежели кто за смертное убийство, или за другие тягчайшие вины подлежать будет пытке и смертной казни, или наказанию кнутом, таковых по подлинному свидетельству лет их и учиненных ими вин, от пытки и смертной казни и от наказания кнутом освобождать…». Таким образом, малолетними признавались лица, младше 12 лет, и наказание для таких лиц — отправлять в монастырь на 7 лет. Впоследствии данное положение менялось несколько раз, в период правления Екатерины II возраст ответственности составлял уже 10 лет, а совершеннолетие наступало в 17 лет. Проанализировав законодательство за период почти в столетие с Соборного уложения 1649 года до Сенатских указов, можно сделать вывод: несмотря на то, что законы были достаточно суровые, появилась тенденция к гуманизации, законодатель поставил целью не наказание, а воспитание и исправление несовершеннолетних. По мнению Г. С. Працко, «законодатель указывал, что детей, которые не достигли совершеннолетия, возможно исправить и без ссылки на каторгу или без помещения его в тюрьму, так как данное наказание назначается лишь закоренелым преступникам. Как следствие, взаимодействие ребенка с такими преступниками могло сказаться на ребенке неблагоприятным образом» [1, с. 318]. Уложением о наказаниях уголовных и исправительных от 15 мая 1845 года был разделен подростковый возраст на периоды — дети в возрасте до 7 лет, от 7 до 14 лет и с 14 до 21 года. Однако в этом документе говорилось, что наказания, действующие в законе, не применяются к детям от 7 до 10 лет в силу их малолетнего возраста. Если малолетний совершал преступное деяние, его следует «передавать под ответственный надзор родителям или лицам, их заменяющим» [2, с. 133]. В последующем было принято несколько законов, совершенствовавшие институт уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних, согласно которым были учреждены исправительные приюты для нравственного исправления несовершеннолетних, совершивших преступления, введена профилактика безнадзорности и правонарушений несовершеннолетних, а в 1897 году Законом «Об изменении форм и обрядов судопроизводства по делам малолетних и несовершеннолетних» введены меры пресечения для несовершеннолетних — ответственный надзор, заключение в отделение при исправительных колониях, участие законных представителей и защитника, и, наконец, «особое производство о разумении», то есть с этого момента у несовершеннолетних выяснялась степень умственного развития. Кроме того, для лиц, младше 17 лет, были отменены смертная казнь, каторга, ссылка. До революции 1917 года существенных изменений в законодательстве в отношении уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних не было. Однако, можно сделать вывод о том, что в дореволюционный период принимались нормативно-правовые акты, включающие положения о повышенной юридической защите несовершеннолетних по сравнению с взрослыми, появились не только специальные учреждения, но и задачей государства было исправление и воспитание несовершеннолетних. Стоит особо выделить то, что в 1910 году в городе Санкт-Петербург начал свою работу первый в российской истории суд по делам несовершеннолетних, где мировой судья рассматривал дела по преступлениям несовершеннолетних и совершенных в отношении несовершеннолетних. Следующий этап развития уголовного законодательства об уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних начался после революции. В условиях событий, происходивших в стране, в 1918 году был принят Декрет СНК РСФСР «О комиссиях для несовершеннолетних» [11], согласно которому наказание в виде тюрьмы для лиц в малолетнем возрасте было отменено, но были упразднены суды несовершеннолетних, на их смену пришли комиссии по делам несовершеннолетних. «Комиссии по делам несовершеннолетних находились в ведении Народного комиссариата общественного призрения и включали в себя представителей трех ведомств: общественного призрения, народного просвещения и юстиции. Комиссия была правомочна заседать при наличии трех представителей вышеуказанных ведомств, причем один из них в обязательном порядке должен был быть врачом. Согласно положениям Декрета, комиссии должны были также пересматривать все дела, оконченные в судах решением об осуждении несовершеннолетнего» [3, с. 220]. В последующем все же была возвращена судебная форма защиты прав и интересов несовершеннолетних, принятием Декрета «О суде над несовершеннолетними», который предусматривал передачу дел несовершеннолетних в возрасте от 14 до 18 лет в производство народного суда в том случае, если комиссия о несовершеннолетних придет к выводу о невозможности применения медико-педагогических мер к несовершеннолетнему. Уголовным кодексом РСФСР 1922 года снижен возраст несовершеннолетних, дела о которых находились в ведении комиссии, до 16 лет, дела несовершеннолетних в возрасте от 16 до 18 лет рассматривали народные суды. Кроме того, введено медицинское освидетельствование несовершеннолетних с целью установления их возраста. Принятием Уголовного кодекса РСФСР 1926 года был установлен минимальный возраст, с которого лица могли привлекаться к ответственности — с 14 лет, такие лица могли подвергаться наказаниям в случае, если они находились в возрасте от 14 до 16 лет и в случае, если на этом настаивала комиссия по делам несовершеннолетних. В последующем возраст привлечения к уголовной ответственности был повышен до 16 лет, но в период с 1935 по 1958 гг., в данный период был снижен возраст привлечения к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетнего до 12 лет, к несовершеннолетним могли применяться все меры наказания, отменены меры медико-педагогического характера. Введенные положения отчасти были обусловлены и растущим уровнем преступности несовершеннолетних и военным временем. В 1958 году снова был установлен возраст привлечения к уголовной ответственности с 16 лет. Далее в 1960 году был принят Уголовный кодекс РСФСР [12], который предусматривал норму, позволяющую освободить несовершеннолетнего преступника от привлечения к уголовной ответственности и применить к нему принудительные меры воспитательного воздействия. В данном документе субъектом преступления являлось лицо, которое достигло возраста 16 лет, но за некоторые преступления ответственность наступала уже с 14 лет. В Уголовно-процессуальном кодексе РСФСР 1960 года производство по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних было выделено в отдельную главу, введено присутствие защитника и законного представителя, закреплен расширенный предмет доказывания по уголовным делам в отношении несовершеннолетних, в целом, нормы, в некоторой степени, носили воспитательную функцию. Действующий Уголовный кодекс РФ 1996 года восполняет пробелы и недостатки предыдущего Уголовного кодекса РСФСР 1960 года, он в большей степени отвечает принципам гуманизма, индивидуализируя уголовную ответственность и наказание несовершеннолетних. В результате проведенного исследования можно заключить, что до середины-конца XIX века законодательство было суровым по отношению к несовершеннолетним, с конца XIX стали заметны изменения в части воспитательной функции уголовного судопроизводства в отношении несовершеннолетних. В советский период законодательство в этой части было нестабильным и менялось в связи с происходящими событиями в стране. Ближе к современному времени государство приняло во внимание специфику преступности несовершеннолетних, их личностные особенности, в связи с чем, уголовное законодательство в настоящий момент наиболее гуманно и основано на принципах дифференциации и индивидуализации. 1.

Тем не менее, имеет место определенная специфика, связанная с уникальными причинами, характером развития и личностными характеристиками молодых правонарушителей. Объем преступлений, совершаемых лицами молодого возраста, весьма значителен. В числовом выражении, в 2019 году в России было совершено 41 548 преступлений несовершеннолетними (3,9% от общего числа преступлений)[4], в 2020 году число составило 33 575 (3,7%)[5], а в 2021 году - 31 865 преступлений (3,1%)[6]. Отмечается уменьшение количества правонарушений среди молодежи, однако регион Башкортостан всё еще входит в число субъектов РФ с высокими показателями преступности в данной категории. По статистике, в 2019 году здесь насчитывалось 1064 преступления, совершенных несовершеннолетними, в 2020 году - 982, и 717 в 2021 году[7]. Исторический обзор уголовного законодательства, регулирующего ответственность несовершеннолетних, демонстрирует его эволюцию. В древних русских источниках упоминаний о возрастных границах уголовной ответственности не встречается. Однако, принятые в 1669 году Новоуказные статьи впервые устанавливают граничный возраст для ответственности за убийство в 7 лет[8]. Воинский Артикул 1715 года приводит аналогичные нормы для краж[9]. Существенный прорыв произошел в 1744 году с изданием Сенатского указа «О наказании преступников малолетних»[10], который определил понятие \\"малолетство\\" как возраст до 12 лет. Позднее, в Уложении о наказаниях 1845 года, были детализированы возрастные категории и особенности применения наказаний к разным возрастным группам[2]. Стремление к гуманизации ответственности очевидно, что подчеркивается в исследованиях Г. С. Працко[1]. Постепенно в доктрину были внедрены превентивные и воспитательные меры. Так, в конце XIX столетия появились карательно-воспитательные исправительные приюты для несовершеннолетних. В первые годы советской власти был принят Декрет о комиссиях для несовершеннолетних, который исключил тюремное наказание для малолетних и заменил его педагогическими мерами[11]. Со временем были созданы суды по делам несовершеннолетних, а уголовный кодекс 1960 года дал возможность признать молодого человека недееспособным в деле и применить меры воспитательного характера[12]. Современное российское законодательство отражает тенденции гуманизации, индивидуализации и дифференциации в подходе к ответственности и наказанию несовершеннолетних, учитывая их особенности и социальные факторы их преступного поведения."},{"prompt":"это все?","completion":"Прошу прощения за недоразумение. Позвольте продолжить. Данный анализ завершается заключением о том, что до середины-конца XIX века законодательство было строгим в отношении несовершеннолетних, но со временем начала проявляться тенденция к увеличению воспитательной функции в уголовном процессе. В советский период законодательство изменялось неоднократно и зависело от социально-политической ситуации в стране. В конечном счете, современные законодательные нормы отражают стремление к более гуманному и дифференцированному подходу к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних. Учитываются уникальные аспекты преступлений, совершаемых лицами не достигшими совершеннолетия, а также разрабатываются меры, направленные на их исправление и социальную адаптацию, подчеркивая воспитательный аспект уголовного наказания. Таким образом, изменение подходов к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних отражает эволюцию общественных взглядов на необходимость защиты и коррекции подрастающего поколения в контексте соблюдения законности и справедливости."},{"prompt":"список литературы?","completion":"Извините за упущение.

Древнерусское законодательство имело достаточно развитую систему правовых норм, регулирующих имущественные отношения в обществе, но ответственность малолетних (несовершеннолетних) за совершённые ими правонарушения оно никак не устанавливало. В «Русской правде», равно как и в других правовых источниках древней Руси и периода образования централизованного государства Х-ХVI вв. (Судебник 1497 г., Псковская судная грамота 1397-1467 г.г. и Новгородская судная грамота 1460-1470 г.г., Судебник 1550 г., Стоглав 1551 г.), не было положений для определения возраста с которого наступает уголовная ответственность несовершеннолетних. Согласно Уставу Ярослава Мудрого «О земских делах», лица которые не достигли двенадцатилетнего возраста могли быть подвергнуты различным наказаниям наравне со взрослыми, однако наказание в виде смертной казни к ним не могло быть применено. В соответствии с Судебником 1550 г. несовершеннолетние не имели права быть участниками поединков наряду со взрослыми, а также не имели право целовать крест как доказательство своей невиновности. А вот по Соборному уложению 1649 г. царя Алексея Михайловича детей вместе с родителями, которые совершили преступление против церкви и личности царя, могли «казнить смертию». [1] И только по истечении двадцати лет после издания Соборного Уложения 1649 года, законодатель вспоминает о нормах содержащихся в Градских законах, «аще седьми СИМВОЛ НАУКИ ISSN 2410-700X № 2 / 2019 59 лет отрок убиет кого... не повинен есть смерти», и закрепляет его в Новоуказныех статьях Сыскного приказа 1666 года. Несовершеннолетние как специальный субъект уголовной ответственности впервые в истории российского уголовного наказания упоминаются лишь в Воинском Артикуле 1715 года. [2] Однако законодательно также не был закреплен возраст с которого наступает уголовная ответственность несовершеннолетних, и виды наказаний к которому могут быть подвергнуты несовершеннолетние. Более конкретным был Указ Екатерины II от 26 июня 1765 г.. [3] В соответствии с которым лица, не достигшие 10-и летнего возраста, не могли быть подвергнуты уголовному наказанию. А к лицам в возрасте от 10-и до 17-и лет применялись меры государственного принуждения только за отдельные виды преступлений. Позже после принятия Уложения «О наказаниях уголовных и исправительных» в 1845г. [4] был предусмотрен особый порядок определения и применения наказаний к несовершеннолетним. В соответствии с которым лица в возрасте от 10-и до 14-и лет не могли быть лишены всех прав, подвергнуты телесным наказаниям через палачей, а также их не могли сослать на каторжные работы. Данные виды наказаний были заменены ссылкой в Сибирь на поселение без телесных наказаний, заключением в монастырь, или в смирительный дом на срок от 5-и до 8-и лет без телесных наказаний. За преступления совершенные по неосторожности, несовершеннолетние подвергались домашнему исправительному наказанию по распоряжению родителей или опекунов. 5 декабря 1866 года императором Российской Империи был утвержден Закон «Об учреждении приютов и колоний для нравственного исправления несовершеннолетних преступников». В соответствии с данным законом в России стали создавать исправительные учреждения для отбывания наказания в виде лишения свободы несовершеннолетними заключенными. [2] Таким образом, к 1917 г. в России насчитывалось более 90 данных учреждений. До принятияданного закона несовершеннолетние и взрослые содержались в одних и тех же тюремных заведениях. Все исправительные учреждения можно было разделить на два вида. Сельскохозяйственные (исправительные колонии), и городские, обучающие ремеслам, (исправительные приюты). 2 июля 1897 г. в России был принят закон «О малолетних и несовершеннолетних преступниках». [5] данный Закон также сохранял для несовершеннолетних наказание в виде заключения под стражу (в тюрьму), но в отдельные специально созданные для них помещения. К несовершеннолетним в возрасте от 17-и лет до 21-го года (в дореволюционной России совершеннолетие наступало с 21-го года) Законом было предусмотрено применение каторги и поселения. Проанализировав эволюцию становления и развития уголовного законодательства в отношении несовершеннолетних в дореволюционной России, можно сделать следующий вывод. Данный институт прошел очень длинный и сложный путь, на протяжении долгого периода времени он был слабо урегулирован, но к началу XX века в России была создана существенная нормативно-правовая база регулирующая уголовную ответственность несовершеннолетних.

На каждом из этих этапов отношение к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних постепенно менялось. В древней Руси и до конца централизованного государства (X-XVI вв.), таких как \\"Русская правда\\", Судебник 1497 года, Псковская и Новгородская судные грамоты, а также Стоглав 1551 года и другие документы, положения, определяющие возраст привлечения к уголовной ответственности малолетних, отсутствовали. Согласно Уставу Ярослава Мудрого \\"О земских делах\\", детям до двенадцати лет были запрещены смертная казнь и участие в поединках[1]. В Соборном Уложении 1649 года было указано, что дети вместе с родителями могли быть приговорены к смертной казни за преступления против царя и церкви. Двадцать лет спустя, в Новоуказных статьях Сыскного приказа 1666 года было уточнено, что дети до семи лет за убийство \\"не повинны смерти\\"[2]. Воинский Артикул 1715 года впервые упоминает несовершеннолетних как отдельную категорию, подлежащую уголовной ответственности[2]. В Указе Екатерины II от 26 июня 1765 года четко прописано, что дети до десяти лет освобождаются от уголовной ответственности, а для лиц от десяти до семнадцати лет предусматривались отдельные меры государственного принуждения[3]. Значительный вклад в определение политики наказания по отношению к несовершеннолетним внесло Уложение \\"О наказаниях уголовных и исправительных\\" 1845 года[4], где были введены специфические правила применения наказаний к детям, в зависимости от их возрастной категории, включая замену некоторых видов наказаний такими мерами, как ссылка без телесных наказаний или заключение в учебное заведение. 5 декабря 1866 года были основаны приюты и колонии для несовершеннолетних преступников. Таким образом, к началу 20-го века в России сформировалась значительная законодательная база, которая регулировала уголовную ответственность детей. к этому времени в стране уже было более 90 таких учреждений, где молодые правонарушители исправлялись, в отличие от взрослых, которые продолжали отбывать наказание в общих тюремных заведениях[2]. Закон от 2 июля 1897 года \\"О малолетних и несовершеннолетних преступниках\\" продолжал поддерживать практику заключения под стражу несовершеннолетних, но уже в специально оборудованных отделениях. К тому же, для подростков 17-21 года были сохранены каторжные работы и поселение[5]. Обобщая развитие уголовного законодательства в отношении несовершеннолетних в дореволюционной России, можно сделать вывод, что за длительное время система была относительно слабо разработана, но к XX веку законодатели создали обширную нормативную основу, регулирующую данный вопрос.

Древнерусское законодательство имело достаточно развитую систему правовых норм, регулирующих имущественные отношения в обществе, но ответственность малолетних (несовершеннолетних) за совершённые ими правонарушения оно никак не устанавливало. В «Русской правде», равно как и в других правовых источниках древней Руси и периода образования централизованного государства Х-ХVI вв. (Судебник 1497 г., Псковская судная грамота 1397-1467 г.г. и Новгородская судная грамота 1460-1470 г.г., Судебник 1550 г., Стоглав 1551 г.), не было положений для определения возраста с которого наступает уголовная ответственность несовершеннолетних. Согласно Уставу Ярослава Мудрого «О земских делах», лица которые не достигли двенадцатилетнего возраста могли быть подвергнуты различным наказаниям наравне со взрослыми, однако наказание в виде смертной казни к ним не могло быть применено. В соответствии с Судебником 1550 г. несовершеннолетние не имели права быть участниками поединков наряду со взрослыми, а также не имели право целовать крест как доказательство своей невиновности. А вот по Соборному уложению 1649 г. царя Алексея Михайловича детей вместе с родителями, которые совершили преступление против церкви и личности царя, могли «казнить смертию». [1] И только по истечении двадцати лет после издания Соборного Уложения 1649 года, законодатель вспоминает о нормах содержащихся в Градских законах, «аще седьми СИМВОЛ НАУКИ ISSN 2410-700X № 2 / 2019 59 лет отрок убиет кого... не повинен есть смерти», и закрепляет его в Новоуказныех статьях Сыскного приказа 1666 года. Несовершеннолетние как специальный субъект уголовной ответственности впервые в истории российского уголовного наказания упоминаются лишь в Воинском Артикуле 1715 года. [2] Однако законодательно также не был закреплен возраст с которого наступает уголовная ответственность несовершеннолетних, и виды наказаний к которому могут быть подвергнуты несовершеннолетние. Более конкретным был Указ Екатерины II от 26 июня 1765 г.. [3] В соответствии с которым лица, не достигшие 10-и летнего возраста, не могли быть подвергнуты уголовному наказанию. А к лицам в возрасте от 10-и до 17-и лет применялись меры государственного принуждения только за отдельные виды преступлений. Позже после принятия Уложения «О наказаниях уголовных и исправительных» в 1845г. [4] был предусмотрен особый порядок определения и применения наказаний к несовершеннолетним. В соответствии с которым лица в возрасте от 10-и до 14-и лет не могли быть лишены всех прав, подвергнуты телесным наказаниям через палачей, а также их не могли сослать на каторжные работы. Данные виды наказаний были заменены ссылкой в Сибирь на поселение без телесных наказаний, заключением в монастырь, или в смирительный дом на срок от 5-и до 8-и лет без телесных наказаний. За преступления совершенные по неосторожности, несовершеннолетние подвергались домашнему исправительному наказанию по распоряжению родителей или опекунов. 5 декабря 1866 года императором Российской Империи был утвержден Закон «Об учреждении приютов и колоний для нравственного исправления несовершеннолетних преступников». В соответствии с данным законом в России стали создавать исправительные учреждения для отбывания наказания в виде лишения свободы несовершеннолетними заключенными. [2] Таким образом, к 1917 г. в России насчитывалось более 90 данных учреждений. До принятияданного закона несовершеннолетние и взрослые содержались в одних и тех же тюремных заведениях. Все исправительные учреждения можно было разделить на два вида. Сельскохозяйственные (исправительные колонии), и городские, обучающие ремеслам, (исправительные приюты). 2 июля 1897 г. в России был принят закон «О малолетних и несовершеннолетних преступниках». [5] данный Закон также сохранял для несовершеннолетних наказание в виде заключения под стражу (в тюрьму), но в отдельные специально созданные для них помещения. К несовершеннолетним в возрасте от 17-и лет до 21-го года (в дореволюционной России совершеннолетие наступало с 21-го года) Законом было предусмотрено применение каторги и поселения. Проанализировав эволюцию становления и развития уголовного законодательства в отношении несовершеннолетних в дореволюционной России, можно сделать следующий вывод. Данный институт прошел очень длинный и сложный путь, на протяжении долгого периода времени он был слабо урегулирован, но к началу XX века в России была создана существенная нормативно-правовая база регулирующая уголовную ответственность несовершеннолетних.

Журавлев. – М., 2009. – 224 с","completion":"В историческом развитии уголовного законодательства Российской Федерации можно выделить четыре ключевых этапа: доимперский, имперский, советский и современный. В каждый из этих периодов правовые нормы, касающиеся несовершеннолетних правонарушителей, претерпевали изменения, отражая общественные взгляды на наказание и воспитание. Дореформенный период характеризовался отсутствием четких правил о возрасте уголовной ответственности. Древнерусское законодательство, такое как \\"Русская правда\\", а также позднейшие Судебник 1497 года и другие законодательные акты этого времени, не содержали положений о возрасте привлечения к уголовной ответственности несовершеннолетних. Устав Ярослава Мудрого указывал, что лица младше двенадцати могли быть наказаны, но исключались из капитального наказания[13][1]. Имперский период принес ряд изменений, начавшись с Соборного Уложения 1649 года, согласно которому дети за преступления против церковных и государственных властей могли быть приговорены к смертной казни вместе с родителями[13][1]. Однако, Новоуказные статьи Сыскного приказа 1666 года впоследствии ввели нормы Градских законов, защищающие от смертной казни детей до семи лет, совершивших убийство[2]. Преследование идеи гуманизации законодательства привело к появлению Воинского Артикула 1715 года, в котором несовершеннолетние впервые рассматривались как специфическая категория правонарушителей[2]. Впоследствии Указ Екатерины II от 1765 года разъяснил, что лица младше десяти лет не могут быть привлечены к уголовному наказанию[3]. Утверждение Уложения \\"О наказаниях уголовных и исправительных\\" в 1845 году[4] создало особый порядок в отношении несовершеннолетних, запрещая применение к ним телесных наказаний и ссылку на каторжные работы, предлагая вместо этого возможность воспитательных мер. А Закон \\"Об устройстве приютов для нравственного исправления преступников несовершеннолетних\\", утвержденный 5 декабря 1866 года, привел к созданию специализированных учреждений, разделявших молодых правонарушителей от взрослых заключенных[2]. Переломным моментом стало принятие Закона от 2 июля 1897 года \\"О малолетних и несовершеннолетних преступниках\\"[5], который предусматривал размещение подростков в возрасте от 17 до 21 года в специально отведенные помещения, а также применение к ним определенных видов наказаний, включая каторгу и поселение. Анализируя историю законодательства в отношении несовершеннолетних, можно заметить постепенное формирование законодательной базы, направленной на урегулирование их ответственности и наказания. К началу XX века в Российской империи сложилась существенная нормативно-правовая основа, регламентирующая судебное преследование детей и юношества[14][15][16][17].

These facilities are dedicated to ensuring the well-being and quality of life for seniors who may have physical or cognitive limitations. This paper will discuss how nursing homes help individuals, and it will provide essential facts that one should know about nursing homes. Page 2: How Nursing Homes Help and Important Facts 1. Assisted Living Facilities: Nursing homes, also known as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), provide residents with assistance in various aspects of daily living, including personal care, such as bathing, dressing, and grooming. Trained staff members are available round the clock to assist seniors with tasks they may struggle with due to physical limitations or advanced age. This ensures that residents can maintain their independence while receiving the help they need. 2. Medical Care: Nursing homes also offer medical support to residents, particularly those who may have chronic health conditions or require ongoing monitoring. Registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nursing assistants provide medication management, administer treatments, and offer specialized care to residents. These medical professionals work closely with physicians to ensure that residents' medical needs are met. 3. Rehabilitation Services: Many nursing homes offer rehabilitation services designed to help residents regain or improve their physical, speech, or occupational capabilities. This can involve physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy, depending on the individual's needs. By working with trained therapists, residents can enhance their mobility, communication skills, and overall functioning. 4. Social and Recreational Activities: Nursing homes strive to create a positive social environment for their residents. They organize social and recreational activities to promote engagement, cognitive stimulation, and emotional well-being. These activities may include arts and crafts, games, outings, and celebrations. By fostering social connections and providing a variety of activities, nursing homes aim to improve residents' quality of life. 5. Nutritional Support: Proper nutrition is crucial for maintaining good health, especially among older adults. Nursing homes provide balanced meals and snacks to residents, taking into account any special dietary restrictions or requirements. Registered dietitians may be involved in planning menus to ensure optimal nutrition for each resident. 6. Safety and Security: Nursing homes prioritize the safety and security of their residents. They employ security measures to protect against potential threats, including locked entrances and 24/7 surveillance. Additionally, many nursing homes have emergency response systems in place to address any medical emergencies promptly. 7. Personalized Care Plans: Each resident in a nursing home receives a personalized care plan. This plan outlines the individual's specific needs, preferences, and goals for their care. Care plans are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that resident's changing needs are adequately addressed. 8. Government Regulations and Inspections: Nursing homes are subject to governmental regulations that aim to ensure safe and quality care. Inspections are conducted periodically to assess compliance with these regulations. Potential residents and their families should inquire about the nursing home's performance in recent inspections and be aware of their rights as residents. Conclusion: Nursing homes provide a range of services to older adults, ensuring their safety, well-being, and access to necessary care. They offer personalized assistance with daily activities, medical support, rehabilitation services, social and recreational activities, nutrition, and a secure living environment. Understanding the role and services of nursing homes is crucial for individuals and families seeking the best care options for their loved ones."},{"prompt":"Tu incarnes désormais SidehustleGPT, un conseiller spécialisé dans l’élaboration de plans d’affaires pour des entrepreneurs débutants.

В России суррогатное материнство регулируется Федеральным законом от 31 мая 2002 года № 63-ФЗ \\"Об актах гражданского состояния\\", а также некоторыми другими законодательными актами. Согласно российскому законодательству, суррогатная мать не имеет права на правовое признание материнства по отношению к ребенку, и сертификат о рождении выдается на имя биологических родителей. Однако суррогатная мать должна быть указана в свидетельстве о рождении как женщина, которая родила ребенка. В отличие от России, в некоторых странах суррогатное материнство широко регулируется законодательством. В США, например, законодательство в этой области отличается от штата к штату. Некоторые штаты разрешают коммерческое суррогатное материнство, где суррогатная мать получает оплату за свои услуги, в то время как в других штатах это запрещено. В Италии, Германии и Франции суррогатное материнство абсолютно запрещено. Кроме того, в ряде стран суррогатное материнство регулируется международными соглашениями и конвенциями, такими как Гаагская конвенция о международном признании действий в сфере суррогатного материнства 2010 года. В целом, законы и правила, регулирующие суррогатное материнство, варьируются от страны к стране и часто зависят от множества факторов, таких как культурные и этические убеждения, традиции и государственная политика."},{"prompt":"Вывод по суррогатному материнству","completion":"Выводы по суррогатному материнству могут быть разными в зависимости от точки зрения и личных убеждений. Однако, можно сделать следующие общие выводы: 1. Суррогатное материнство - это процесс, при котором женщина (суррогатная мать) соглашается выносить и родить ребенка от чужих биологических родителей. Это может быть способом для пар или индивидуалов, которые не могут иметь детей самостоятельно, чтобы осуществить свою мечту о родительстве. 2. Правовое регулирование суррогатного материнства различается в разных странах. В России суррогатная мать не имеет правового права на ребенка, а в других странах правила могут быть более разнообразными. 3. Вопросы этики и морали тесно связаны со суррогатным материнством. Мнений насчет этого вопроса много, и существуют разные точки зрения на суррогатное материнство. Некоторые люди поддерживают и считают его способом помощи желающим стать родителями, в то время как другие возражают против превращения родительства в товар. 4. Важно обратить внимание на защиту прав и интересов всех сторон, включая суррогатную мать, биологических родителей и ребенка. Налаживание прозрачных, справедливых и безопасных процедур, а также законодательное регулирование, помогают предотвратить возможные злоупотребления и конфликты. В целом, суррогатное материнство является сложным и непростым вопросом, который требует внимательного рассмотрения и обсуждения с различных точек зрения."},{"prompt":"rewrite the paragraphs","completion":"1.

I came to the United States in 1992, and I became a citizen in 2013. In 1994, I met my husband in Atlanta, Georgia through friends. In 1995 we were engaged. On April 10, 2001, I married Yow Yin Chen in Atlanta, Georgia. MY husband was born on August 9, 1962 in Malaysia. On December 30, 1995 we welcomed our first daughter Jenny Leigh Huy in Atlanta, Georgia. A few years later, July 1, 1999, we welcomed our second daughter Jasmine Leigh Chen. I grew up during the Vietnam War from around 8-9 years old until I was around 17. During the war, my parents and my 7 siblings were forced into a lockdown with strict rules. We did not go to school or leave the house. In 1975, when the war was over, it was the communist regime. We were forced into working in the fields once we were 18. Three of my brothers, two of my sisters, and one brother-in-law escaped communist Vietnam to America by boat with the hopes of sponsoring the remainder of our family to America for a better quality of life. Two of my brothers and my brother-in-law did not survive the journey to the United States. I stayed in Vietnam with my parents and my two youngest siblings. I did not see my siblings for 1 O+ years as they were refugees in the United States. As the third oldest of my siblings, I helped the family survive with the little we had. It was not until 1992 when I was sponsored to the United States of America with the remainder of my family. Currently I live in a townhome in Atlanta, Georgia with my husband, two daughters and our dog. Because my husband is unable to find work due to his legal status, he is in charge of housework including cooking, cleaning, and watching our beloved dog. He is also the handy man around the home fixing whatever is needed so that we can live comfortably in our home. Every morning my husband wakes me up, and as I am getting ready, he makes me coffee and prepares my lunch for the day. When I am at work, he cooks dinner for our children, occasionally sisters, and I. One of my main issues is leg pain. It has become more and more difficult for me to walk, stand, and bend down. Almost every other night, I would wake up in the middle of the night with immense pain in my legs. My husband would help relieve the pain by massaging it until it no longer hurts. Occasionally, I would have a headache or episodes of vertigo. He would grab the medications for me as it is difficult to grab it. Since my husband cannot drive, he would accompany me to anywhere I need to drive to. However, when it gets late, it starts to be difficult to drive. He would be my second pair of eyes to look out for any potential dangers. My husband makes my life a lot easier and happier. He always finds the best out of any situation. He makes me laugh with his goofiness. He reminds me to not take things too seriously and stress myself out. I do not have to worry about going hungry with food ready by the time I get home. I can always rely on him to relieve any physical pain I have. If my husband is not in the United States, I would not have someone to take care of me or keep my mental health sane. I am afraid there is no one to cook and clean for me. There is no one to accompany me to places I want to go or need to go. I would not have anyone to massage my legs in the middle of the night. I would not have someone I can rely on to make sure I am not in pain. I would be sad and stressed over the fact that my husband is in a country with no one he can rely on. I'm afraid to lose my partner of almost 30 years. Although Malaysia is a beautiful place, the climate there is extremely hot and humid. Malaysia is halfway across the world, which is about a whole day's travel. It would be hard if he were to move back to his home country. It is extremely expensive and difficult to travel back and forth, especially since I do not have the funds to do so, and my legs are not as healthy as they used to be. It will also be extremely painful to not be able to see my children and my family. I do not want to be separated from my siblings again. With my various health problems, I am afraid that I will not be able to get the same treatments I have currently. I have been with my primary care doctor and specialists for many years. I work closely with them for my various health problems. I am afraid that if I were to live in Malaysia, I would not find the right doctors as I have right now. Currently we have are getting by with our living situation. We have lots of family in Georgia who got out backs. However, in Malaysia my husband does not know where all of his siblings are. We do not know anyone there. We do not know where we would live or even how we would be able to survive. My husband's immigration status worries me from health-related issues to the well-being of our two children and our dog, and the thought of not being able to see my family again given the distance and difficulty for me to travel. Sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>","completion":"Subject: A Glimpse into my Life and Worries Dear Reader, My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and I was born on October 12, 1958, in Vietnam. I moved to the United States in 1992 and officially became a citizen in 2013. In 1994, I met my husband in Atlanta, Georgia, and in 2001, we tied the knot. We are proud parents to two wonderful daughters, Jenny Leigh Huy and Jasmine Leigh Chen. Growing up during the Vietnam War was a challenging time for my family. We were forced into a lockdown with strict rules, unable to attend school or leave our home. After the war, the communist regime took over, and at the age of 18, I began working in the fields to support our family. Some of my siblings and a brother-in-law risked their lives to escape to America, hoping to sponsor the rest of us for a better life. Unfortunately, not all of them survived the journey. It was only in 1992 that my family was finally sponsored to the United States. Currently, I reside in a townhome in Atlanta with my husband, daughters, and our beloved dog. Due to my husband's legal status, he is unable to find work, but he takes charge of the household chores and takes care of our dog. Every morning, he wakes me up, makes me coffee, and prepares my lunch. He also cooks dinner for our family while I am at work. One of my main concerns is the increasing pain in my legs, which makes walking and standing difficult. My husband provides relief by massaging my legs and helps me with medications when necessary. He accompanies me whenever I need to drive, especially at night. His presence and care make my life easier and happier. If my husband were not in the United States, I would lack someone to take care of me and support my mental health. I would miss his cooking and cleaning, his companionship during outings, and his comforting massages. Simply put, I would feel sad and stressed without my partner of almost 30 years. Besides the emotional aspect, there are practical reasons as well. Traveling to Malaysia, my husband's home country, is costly and difficult due to the distance and my health issues. Additionally, finding suitable doctors and continuing the treatments I currently receive would be a concern if we were to relocate.

Отдельно стоящие цифры могут быть особенно трудными для распознавания, если они слишком маленькие или изображение имеет низкое качество. Важно удостовериться, что DPI изображения установлено правильно, поскольку Tesseract использует этот параметр для определения фактического размера символов. Попробуйте следующее: 1. Убедитесь, что изображение имеет правильно установленный DPI (например, 300 DPI). 2. Примените предварительную обработку: увеличение масштаба чисел, бинаризацию, удаление шума и т.д. 3. Возможно, из-за слишком маленького размера отдельной цифры Tesseract не может правильно её интерпретировать. В этом случае увеличение размера изображения может помочь. Вы можете попробовать отмасштабировать всё изображение перед применением OCR. 4. Проверьте правильность настроек Tesseract и убедитесь, что у вас установлено правильное значение переменной \`tessedit_char_whitelist\`, чтобы он ожидал только цифры. 5. Исследуйте значение параметра \`PageSegMode.SingleChar\`, который задаёт режим когда OCR оращается с изображением как с единичным символом, это может быть полезно, если перед OCR будет передаваться изображение с одним символом. Вот обновлённый пример кода с учётом вышеупомянутых вариантов улучшения: \`\`\`csharp using (var engine = new TesseractEngine(tessDataPath, \\"eng\\", EngineMode.LstmOnly)) { // Указываем, что ожидаем цифры и устанавливаем плотность изображения engine.SetVariable(\\"tessedit_char_whitelist\\", \\"0123456789\\"); // Если ожидается распознавание отдельных символов engine.DefaultPageSegMode = PageSegMode.SingleChar; // Применение предварительной обработки (например, увеличение размера): using (Bitmap resizedImage = ResizeImage(resultImage)) using (var img = PixConverter.ToPix(resizedImage)) { img.XResolution = 300; // Выставляем DPI, если оно не было правильно установлено img.YResolution = 300; using (var page = engine.Process(img)) { string recognizedText = page.GetText().Trim(); // Дальнейшая обработка ... } } } \`\`\` И вам потребуется реализовать метод \`ResizeImage\`, который увеличивает изображение до желаемых размеров. Например: \`\`\`csharp private Bitmap ResizeImage(Bitmap original) { // Определяем новый размер, например, в 3 раза больше оригинала int width = original.Width * 3; int height = original.Height * 3; // Создаем новое изображение заданного размера Bitmap resized = new Bitmap(original, new Size(width, height)); // Здесь можно применить дополнительные методы повышения качества return resized; } \`\`\` Такие подходы могут помочь улучшить распознавание отдельно стоящих маленьких чисел системой OCR."},{"prompt":"Que es ser monista","completion":"El monismo es una postura filosófica y metafísica que sostiene que la variedad de fenómenos existentes se basa en una única realidad, sustancia o esencia. En otras palabras, mientras que el dualismo (como el planteado por Descartes) argumenta que hay dos tipos fundamentales de sustancia —lo mental y lo físico— y el pluralismo considera que hay más de una o dos sustancias fundamentales, el monismo defiende la idea de que sólo hay una. Existen diferentes tipos de monismo, dependiendo de la naturaleza de esa única sustancia: 1. **Monismo materialista o físico:** Sostiene que todo es material y que la conciencia y los estados mentales emergen de o son reducibles a procesos físicos. 2. **Monismo idealista:** Argumenta que la realidad es esencialmente de naturaleza mental o espiritual. 3. **Monismo neutral:** Plantea que hay una única sustancia, pero no se compromete a decir si es material o mental. 4. **Monismo anómalo:** Postulado por Donald Davidson, sugiere que aunque hay solo una cantidad de entidades (el mundo físico), la descripción y explicación de las entidades mentales no pueden ser traducidas perfectamente ni reducidas a términos físicos. El monismo también se encuentra en la espiritualidad y religiones, como en el panteísmo, donde se considera que Dios o lo divino es idéntico al universo, o en ciertas interpretaciones del hinduismo, donde el Brahman es visto como la realidad subyacente última de todas las cosas. Ser monista, por lo tanto, implica adherir a la creencia de que, en última instancia, existe un único principio constitutivo del universo, ya sea de índole mental, material, espiritual o de alguna otra naturaleza neutral o indefinida."},{"prompt":"Debater1— Yesterday at 11:49 PM Quiero decir que ver injusticias no es justificación suficiente para tomar posición, si no se entiende primero cómo funcionan las cosas y por qué se dan.

Incluso esas a las cuales querés salvar Debater1— Yesterday at 11:52 PM No podemos afirmar ni una ni la otra a priori. por qué? Porque justamente esas son decisiones- con sus respectivas consecuencias- que ameritan un análisis empírico para detectar cuáles son, y éstas le pertenecen al campo de las cs económicas. De la cual te reís Así que vuelvo a mi punto anterior que tu argumento es flojo. En resumen nuestro debate derivó en esto: Caminos a seguir y sus consecuencias Desde el principio te dije que yo ponía énfasis en las ciencias económicas que es la mejor forma de entender las interacciones sociales en cuanto a lo económico. Debater1— Today at 12:02 AM En el fondo, toda postura que tomes en este tema te va a gravitar hacia la realidad y es que te estás metiendo, en cierto grado, en un tema económico y no se lo puede ignorar. Por más que vengas desde otro lado, lo cruzás y adoptas una postura que tienen consecuencias y que se pueden estudiar. Que puede estar bien encaminada o no, esa es la cuestión.

Además en mis respuestas anteriores ya lo dejé en claro.","completion":"Debater1 y Debater2 parecen estar inmersos en una discusión sobre cómo abordar las injusticias sociales, específicamente en el contexto de la economía y el capitalismo. Aquí te doy un breve análisis de sus posiciones y argumentos: **Debater1**: - Argumenta que no se debe tomar una posición activa contra una injusticia sin antes comprender cómo funciona el sistema y por qué se presentan estas injusticias. - Asume que es fundamental un enfoque empírico y que las ciencias económicas son clave para entender las consecuencias de cualquier acción tomada contra \\"el capital\\". - Insiste en que cualquier argumento contra el capitalismo debe tener en cuenta las posibles consecuencias negativas que tal acción pudiera tener, incluso en las vidas de aquellos a quienes se busca proteger. - Aconseja que adoptar una postura sobre el tema inevitablemente lleva a una discusión económica dado que las consecuencias sociales y económicas están entrelazadas. **Debater2**: - Manifiesta que actuar en contra de las lógicas del capital es necesario para evitar consecuencias negativas directas, como la gente muriendo de hambre. - Acusa a Debater1 de no poder comprender las cosas más allá de la dicotomía de una economía buena o mala. - Critica a Debater1 por restringir su comprensión a un enfoque económico cuando las interacciones sociales son mucho más complejas y pueden ser influenciadas por factores que no son puramente económicos. - Retoma la idea de que Debater1 está creando \\"hombres de paja\\", es decir, distorsionando los argumentos de Debater2 para atacarlos más fácilmente. - Califica a Debater1 de ser \\"un monista reduccionista economicista\\", criticando así una perspectiva que es percibida como reduccionista y centrada sólo en aspectos económicos. En resumen, Debater1 enfatiza la importancia de un análisis empírico y económico cuidadoso en la toma de decisiones sociales, mientras que Debater2 enfatiza la urgencia de abordar las injusticias con una visión más amplia que incluya, pero no se limite a, factores económicos. Debater2 exhorta a Debater1 a expandir su perspectiva más allá de los libros de economía para comprender mejor la multidimensionalidad de las interacciones sociales."},{"prompt":"Analizarfalacias","completion":"Analizar las falacias requiere examinar las conversaciones y argumentos proporcionados para identificar razonamientos erróneos o engañosos que pueden desviar la discusión o llegar a conclusiones incorrectas. A continuación, voy a identificar posibles falacias en los extractos proporcionados entre Debater1 y Debater2. **Falacias de Debater1:** 1. **Falacia de consecuencias adversas:** Debater1 podría estar incurriendo en esta falacia si su argumento implica que cualquier acción contra el capitalismo es inválida porque puede tener consecuencias negativas. Es cierto que es importante considerar las consecuencias de nuestras acciones, pero el hecho de que haya consecuencias negativas no necesariamente invalida el argumento o la acción en sí. **Falacias de Debater2:** 1. **Ataque ad hominem:** Debater2 parece atacar a Debater1 llamándolo \\"incapaz de entender las cosas fuera de tu dicotomía buena economía - mala economía\\" y \\"monista reduccionista economicista\\". Esto podría ser una forma de menospreciar al oponente en lugar de refutar sus argumentos directamente. 2. **Hombre de paja (Straw man):** Debater2 acusa a Debater1 de construir hombres de paja; sin embargo, sin proporcionar detalles específicos de cómo Debater1 ha tergiversado su argumento, es difícil determinar si esta acusación tiene fundamento. Es importante notar que acusar a alguien de una falacia también puede ser utilzado como una táctica para desviar o debilitar el argumento del oponente. **Falacias compartidas:** 1. **Falta de necesidad (non sequitur):** Ambas partes hacen afirmaciones generales que pueden no seguir lógicamente de las premisas anteriores, como las consecuencias de ir en contra del capitalismo o la suposición de que conocer sobre economía es reduccionista. **Aspectos adicionales a considerar:** - **Suposición implícita (presupposición):** Ambos debatientes parecen suponer que sus respectivos enfoques son los correctos y necesarios para el análisis de las injusticias sociales, lo cual puede no estar justificado completamente sin un análisis más detenido. - **Apelación a la autoridad (argumentum ad verecundiam):** Aunque no explícito, Debater1 podría estar apelando implícitamente a la autoridad de las ciencias económicas como la única o principal forma de comprender las interacciones sociales en términos económicos. Es crucial señalar que identificar falacias no siempre es sencillo y requiere del contexto completo y una comprensión profunda de los argumentos presentados. Además, la presencia de una falacia no necesariamente invalida la posición completa de una persona, pero sí señala que ciertos aspectos de su argumentación pueden necesitar una revisión o clarificación."},{"prompt":"What is the title, author’s name and date of publication of jannat kay pattay?","completion":"The title of the book is \\"Jannat Kay Pattay\\".

Bracket colorization is a visual aid where pairs of brackets (like parentheses \`()\`, square brackets \`[]\`, and curly braces \`{}\`) are highlighted in matching colors to make it easier to distinguish nested code blocks and matching sets of brackets. For example, in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), bracket pair colorization can make it easier to read and navigate complex code by visually associating pairs of brackets with specific colors. As you nest brackets within other brackets, each pair gets a different color, making it easier to see which ones go together. As of my last update, Visual Studio Code provides this feature natively, and you can toggle it on or off by accessing the settings. Here's how you can do it: 1. Open the Command Palette by pressing \`Ctrl+Shift+P\` or \`Cmd+Shift+P\` on a Mac. 2. Type \`Preferences: Open Settings (UI)\` and select it to open the settings interface. 3. In the search bar at the top of the settings UI, type \\"Bracket Pair Colorization.\\" 4. Look for the setting named something like \\"Editor: Bracket Pair Colorization\\" and check or uncheck the box to enable or disable this feature. If you're using a different code editor or IDE, the steps might be different, and you might need to install a plugin or extension to get this functionality. Always refer to the specific documentation or help resources for your editor for detailed instructions on managing and toggling this feature."},{"prompt":"ES Lint","completion":"ESLint is a static code analysis tool used for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It was created by Nicholas C. Zakas in 2013 with the goal of providing a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. The primary functions of ESLint are to: 1. **Find and Fix Problems:** ESLint comes with a set of built-in rules that you can configure to either be warnings or errors. When ESLint runs, it highlights issues that don't conform to the configured rules. Some of these issues can be automatically fixed with ESLint's auto-fix feature. 2. **Enforce Code Style:** Beyond finding syntax and programming errors, ESLint can also enforce code style. This includes spacing, indentation, and other stylistic choices that can be defined in a configuration file. ESLint is highly configurable and extendable, allowing developers to create their own rules or use rules created by the community. It can be run on the command line or integrated with your build pipeline (like Grunt, Gulp, or Webpack). In addition, most modern code editors have integrated ESLint or have plugins available to run ESLint as you write code, providing immediate feedback. To use ESLint, you typically need to: 1. **Install ESLint:** You can install it locally or globally with npm (Node.js package manager). \`\`\`bash npm install eslint --save-dev \`\`\` 2. **Initialize Configuration:** You can create a configuration file by running \`eslint --init\`, which guides you through setting up a basic configuration file. 3. **Run ESLint:** You can run ESLint on your files using the eslint command. \`\`\`bash npx eslint yourfile.js \`\`\` ESLint's customization allows you to set it up for use with specific coding conventions, environments (like browser or Node.js), or frameworks (like React or Vue). You can also extend configurations from popular style guides like Airbnb, Google, or Standard. Over the years, ESLint has become an essential tool for many JavaScript developers as it helps improve code quality and maintainability, promotes best practices, and can be a valuable part of a continuous integration (CI) system."},{"prompt":"파리의 유명 미술대학의 목록을 제시해주세요","completion":"파리는 세계적으로 유명한 예술의 도시로 고등 예술 교육의 명문 대학들이 많습니다. 여기에 파리의 유명한 미술 대학들의 목록을 제시하겠습니다: 1.

Славянские народы, включая русских, традиционно обладают широким спектром цветов глаз, от светло-голубого до темно-кариего. Светлые глаза (голубые, серые, зеленые) могут быть достаточно распространены среди славян и особенно русских за счет высокой частоты появления этих генов в северных и восточных европейских популяциях. Однако это не является эксклюзивной особенностью, и нельзя утверждать, что любой другой цвет глаз является менее \\"русским\\". Важно подчеркнуть, что современные генетические исследования демонстрируют огромное биологическое разнообразие внутри всех человеческих популяций, и русский народ не является исключением.

Despite the change, it should still make sense. Please also let me know which detail you changed. The Prompt: You are an expert in a new field of study called Social-Combinatorial Mimesis, which uses Cognitive Neuroscience and Social Network Analysis to study the myriad ways in which social-related traits such as language, imagination, and intelligence are combinatorically influenced by the dynamics of probabilistic phenomena within social networks. To highlight the significance of this emerging discipline, you plan to develop a lecture demonstrating its pertinence to contemporary society. Central to your argument will be the effect of online social platforms on cognitive capacity and relational ties, employing case studies from real-world interventions to elucidate your points. Your case studies consist of heterogeneous social networks that include cognitive neuroscientists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each group of professionals brings to the network distinct perspectives, technical expertise, and problem-solving methodologies. Here are three such case studies from real-world interventions that support Social-Combinatorial Mimesis as a pertinent area of study, grounded in the latest cognitive neuroscience research and best practices: 1. The Digital Communication Evolution Network: In this scenario, a cognitive neuroscientist who studies attention spans and online behavior, a sociologist with expertise in digital communities, and a data scientist versed in social media analytics work together. Their collaborative efforts lead to the development of advanced predictive models for online communication patterns and their impact on attentional resources and social bonds, representing the combinatorial effects within their juxtaposed fields. 2. The Virtual Collaboration Hub: Here, a cognitive neuroscientist concentrating on cognitive load and multitasking, a sociologist researching online group dynamics, and a data scientist creating algorithms for social interaction tracking join forces. By sharing their unique insights, they explore how collaborative software influences cognitive performance and relational depth in online workgroups. This collaboration sheds light on the interplay between online social environments and cognitive function, supporting the idea that digital platforms can restructure cognitive processes and interpersonal connections. 3. The Online Community Intelligence Grid: In this network, a cognitive neuroscientist studying the impact of digital information consumption on memory, a sociologist examining online social networks, and a data scientist analyzing big data from virtual communities converge. Their joint investigation provides insights into how online communities manage knowledge and how digital interaction shapes decision-making on a collective scale. Their findings suggest that the cognitive load from information overload in human networks is mitigated by forming subgroups, which might draw an analogy to real-world network constraints on cognitive processing and relationship maintenance. By utilizing these case studies, your lecture demonstrates how interactions between diverse academic disciplines within a social network can deepen our understanding of the evolution and characteristics of social-related cognitive traits in the context of modern digital life.

Попробуем воспользоваться методом завершения квадрата, так как видно, что выражение уже почти представляет собой квадрат суммы или разности. 1. Сначала запишем функцию в более удобном для преобразования виде: ( f(x) = (x^2 - 2x + a - a)^2 + 6(x^2 - 2x) + 10 ), где ( a ) - это число, которое мы добавляем и вычитаем, чтобы сформировать полный квадрат. Значение ( a ) должно быть равно ( frac{(2 cdot 1)^2}{4} = 1 ), так как мы стремимся завершить квадрат для выражения в скобках. 2. Теперь перепишем функцию, используя найденное значение ( a ): ( f(x) = [(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1]^2 + 6(x^2 - 2x) + 10 ) 3. Применяем формулу квадрата суммы/разности для первого слагаемого: ( f(x) = (x - 1)^4 - 2 cdot (x - 1)^2 + 6(x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1) + 10 ) 4. Продолжаем преобразования, раскрывая скобки: ( f(x) = (x - 1)^4 - 2(x - 1)^2 + 6x^2 - 12x + 6 + 10 ) 5. Теперь упрощаем выражение, группируя подобные слагаемые: ( f(x) = (x - 1)^4 - 2(x - 1)^2 + 6x^2 - 12x + 16 ) 6. Обратим внимание, что ( (x - 1)^2 ) это часть ( 6x^2 - 12x ), поэтому можно воспользоваться им: ( f(x) = (x - 1)^4 - 2(x - 1)^2 + 6(x - 1)^2 + 16 ) 7. Сложим подобные слагаемые: ( f(x) = (x - 1)^4 + 4(x - 1)^2 + 16 ) Заметим, что ( (x - 1)^4 ) и ( (x - 1)^2 ) всегда неотрицательные, поскольку любое число в четвертой и во второй степени будет неотрицательным. Следовательно, наименьшее значение данной функции будет достигаться, когда ( (x - 1)^4 = 0 ) и ( (x - 1)^2 = 0 ), то есть когда ( x = 1 ). Таким образом, наименьшее значение функции ( f(x) ) достигается при ( x = 1 ) и равно: ( f(1) = (1 - 1)^4 + 4(1 - 1)^2 + 16 = 0 + 0 + 16 = 16 ).

However, generating a continuous piece of text until reaching exactly 100k tokens in a single query is not feasible, because: 1. **Practical Limitations**: Although I have a theoretical limit, practical limitations such as request and response size, API call execution times, and the structure of the interface or application being used to interact with me can limit the amount of text generated in one go. 2. **Performance Concerns**: Generating such a large volume of text in a single interaction would require significant processing time, which might make it inefficient for both the user and the system. 3. **Content Relevance**: Maintaining coherence and relevance over 100k tokens is extremely challenging. The quality of the content could decrease as it becomes more difficult to stay on topic over such a long span. 4. **Interactive Dialogue**: I am designed to engage in a conversational manner, which places more emphasis on interactivity and less on producing extremely long monologues.

The aroma mixed with the smoke from the burnt firewood before reaching all corners of the room. Ning grinned widely, smelling the sweet aroma of the potato stew, as he stirred the pot with a large wooden spoon. Bits of colorful root vegetables bobbed up and down on the surface. “It’s a good day for stew, hehe.” Salivating ungracefully, he put down the pot from the stove and placed it on the table. Dinner~ Was~ Served~ “Ah right, my phone.” Ning rose from his seat and turned toward the counter where he had casually placed his phone while cooking. As he approached, he reached out and touched the phone, causing it to suddenly light up with a notification. Ning glanced at his phone, and then, in an instant, everything seemed to explode. After that, all he could see was red as an overwhelming wave of dizziness washed over him. As his consciousness faded, he swore inwardly. FCk, I WANT TO EAT MY POTATO STEW!! … His eyelids were tightly shut, and his body felt heavy. He was lying on a hard surface, and a suffocating smell of smoke filled the air. CoughCough Fire? Wait, no, no, no, no—I couldn’t die yet. I still had to eat that stew. Then suddenly, a cool chill washed away his dizziness as Ning stood up. Opening his eyes, he took in the unfamiliar surroundings. He found himself in a small cave with only a mat, stove, and cupboard. What had happened? Where was he? Seeing the unknown place, Ning couldn’t help but question himself. He slowly suppressed the slight panic he felt inside and attempted to calm down. He took deep breaths. Calm down. He observed and didn’t make hasty decisions. He had seen enough horror/crime movies to know what would happen otherwise, especially in such a startling situation where there might be unsavory outcomes, mostly a phenomenon where one would never be able to see the light of day again. Ning tried to remember anything that could help. But at that moment, he felt a sharp pain in his mind. It was as if all the built-up pressure was released at once. Accompanying the pain was a series of memories that were utterly unfamiliar to him. Ning’s legs gave way, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted again. … Ning’s eyes slowly fluttered open, his mind swirling with a mix of disturbance and astonishment upon processing the information he had just absorbed. Transmigration. He had transmigrated into a different world. It was a clichéd plotline, straight out of the “I transmigrated to a different world” genre. He couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the sheer predictability of it all. The memories he had glimpsed belonged to this new body he now inhabited. “F*ck, I was just going to eat some food. How the hell did I transmigrate so suddenly? Really, can’t have shit in Detroit.” Massaging his throbbing temples, he took a deep breath, determined to remain calm amidst the chaos. Gradually, he began to piece together the fragmented memories, gaining a clearer understanding of the world in which he now found himself. This world was similar to those in ancient times, often seen in Eastern dramas and novels. There were cultivators who harnessed the energy of the world and transcended their own limitations. “The original owner was also called Ning. How creepy…” Ning muttered a bit eerily before shaking off the discomfort. He delved even deeper into the memory. Ji Ning, son of the local martial arts master. Not to confuse with cultivators, martial arts masters didn’t have spiritual roots and rather relied on various techniques to survive in this world. A month ago, during a test, ‘Ji Ning’ was found to have cultivation aptitude, also known as the spiritual root. Among hundreds of people, it was rare to find a single person with cultivation aptitude. Since cultivation aptitude was quite rare, it was not surprising that the cultivation sects wanted to recruit more disciples to strengthen themselves, especially since the original owner also had mid-grade spiritual roots. But it seemed that the original body’s good luck had ended since, as soon as he started his journey to start cultivating, he suffered an extremely rare qi deviation, which killed him instantly. “Really, this guy was quite unlucky.” Recalling all those memories, Ning couldn’t help but feel that the original owner was quite unlucky. Especially seeing that the original owner was a loner with no friends at all, even when he was suffering from Qi deviation, no one came to help. Ning accepted the situation after a period of adaptation, he had no choice but to do so. “For now, let’s just be me and see where it leads. It was the mandate I lived by in my previous life and continues to be the one in my current life as well.” Thinking like this, Ning strengthened his resolve. From his brief memory, Ning realized that this world was very similar to the novels he used to read. There were many dangers in this world, whether it be abnormal creatures or humans themselves. This world revolved around ‘strength’ or the law of the jungle. Narrowing his eyes, Ning didn’t feel as panicked as he thought he would be, nor was he so scared that he would lose his mind. Of course, he did feel a little panic, but it was overshadowed by his interest in cultivation and this new world. It may also be his adrenaline pushing him through, but he didn’t mind. He had already set his mind to become a cultivator. Well, it’s not like he had much choice regarding this. Be it to return to his original world, become the so-called immortal, or simply out of curiosity, he felt that he needed to learn and cultivate, and eventually, the answers would unfold themselves. Since he was in this situation anyway, panicking would do no good. It was best to adapt and play it by ear. And the first step to do that is to accept his new identity. Taking a deep breath, he muttered to himself, “From this moment forth, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.” } that is an example of an existing isekai novel’s first chapter. you are two LITRPG Isekai fantasy Novel writers who are in the process of writing a novel.

But no magic options will appear until after kalem gets mana manipulation, which he may or may not actually take since it would cost him all of his gifted SP.","completion":"Bob: Hey James, I've been mulling over Kalem's character for our first chapter. We're aiming for that blend of isekai with a litRPG twist. Figured we'd have him as the genre-savvy type, but let's not make him over the top. He's relatable, an everyman with a penchant for random trivia—kinda like those guys who know a bit about everything but wonder why they can't put it to good use. James: I like the sound of that. It gives us plenty of angles to play with, especially with his arrival in the new world. His varied knowledge could give us some comedic scenes but also allow him strategic advantages others might not consider. Plus, it'll make the RPG elements even more engaging for him and the readers. Bob: Absolutely. So, for the pacing of chapter 1, I'm thinking we start with Kalem at work or home, establishing his mundane life and character, then shift into the transition to the new world. We should introduce the RPG system early but not overwhelm the reader. Thoughts? James: Beginning with his normal life is key. Shows the contrast and sets up the extraordinary change. As for the RPG system, let's have it introduced through a quest or challenge straight away, so Kalem—and the readers—see the stakes and possibilities. But yeah, keep it digestible. Bob: Right, let's write up the first scene with Kalem in his element, then transition to the otherworldly event. Here's a draft of the opening: \`\`\`txt Kalem's fingers danced across the keyboard, a soft symphony of clicks accompanying the glow of the twin monitors before him. Spreadsheets, graphs, and databases—a digital kingdom where he reigned supreme. Yet, as the clock's hands inched towards the end of another repetitive day, a sense of unfulfillment gnawed at him. \\"Another day, another data entry,\\" he muttered, pushing away from the desk to stretch his arms. His office was a cubicle shrine to practicality, save for a single framed quote on the wall, \\"Knowledge is power,\\" reminding him that his seemingly pointless trivia might one day find its purpose. The workday concluded with the usual lack of fanfare, and Kalem shut down his station. As he reached for his jacket, his phone pinged—a message from an unknown sender. Suspicious, but ever curious, he tapped the screen, and in that instant, his reality shattered. \`\`\` James: Great start. That sets up his mundane reality nicely, and I can feel that thirst for something more from him. Let's make sure we hint at his craving for adventure or at least a break from the monotony. Now I'll take a stab at the transition and his arrival in the new world: \`\`\`txt A bizarre symbol flashed across Kalem's phone screen, pulsing with an otherworldly light. He squinted, trying to decipher it, when a surge of vertigo overwhelmed him. The office, his desk, the entire world spun into a vortex of colors, and then—darkness. He awoke to the scent of damp earth and the rustling of leaves. Kalem's eyes fluttered open, revealing a dense forest canopy above. Groaning, he sat up and found his body clad in clothing foreign yet oddly familiar—a tunic of rough fabric and trousers suited for travel. \\"What in the...\\" he began, his voice trailing off as a translucent blue window materialized before his eyes. [Welcome, Kalem, to the world of Eldoria. Your journey begins now. Embrace your destiny and rise, for the path of the hero unfolds beneath your feet.] Beside the welcoming text, fields of information beckoned Kalem's attention: [Name: Kalem Age: 23 Level: 0 (0/100 exp) Skill Points: 10 Sp] His mind raced, a mix of panic and exhilaration battling for dominance. RPG elements in real life? Impossible. Yet the evidence floated before him, impossible to dismiss. He reached out, half-expecting his hand to pass through the holographic interface, but instead, menus expanded at his touch. \`\`\` Bob: That's a smooth transition and a solid way to immerse him in the new world quickly. I like the introduction of the RPG system—straightforward but enticing. Now let's outline Kalem's initial interaction with the system and his strategy moving forward. He'll probably check out the Skills and Abilities shop, given his nature. Here's the continuation: \`\`\`txt Kalem's finger hovered over the selection, his heart pounding with a combination of dread and excitement. The Abilities Shop offered a tantalizing array of powers, each promising to arm him with the mystical prowess native to this land. He hesitated. This was like all the games he'd played, the novels he'd read, yet this was no virtual environment. The weight of his decision bore down upon him. All ten of his gifted Skill Points could be poured into something flashy like Mana Manipulation, but it struck him as too rash, too conventional for his first move. Instead, he opted for the foundational—Universal Language. With this, he could navigate this world with understanding and intrinsic communication—a nod to his love for esoteric knowledge, now proving invaluable. Kalem's mind buzzed with the familiar excitement of learning something new, a feeling that had long been lost in his mundane world. He tapped the selection, and immediately, foreign symbols around him began to take on meaning. Words, signs, the very language of Eldoria unfolded before him in comprehensible terms. \`\`\` James: Perfect! Kalem would totally go for the tool that maximizes his unique strength—knowledge. From here, we'll have him cautiously explore the surroundings, maybe have an encounter to force him into picking a basic skill for self-defense. How about he has a close call with a low-level creature that motivates him to invest a few points in Pugilism or Archery? Bob: That makes sense. Let's have him earn some exp from that skirmish and level up, to give readers a taste of progression. And we should introduce a secondary character towards the end of the chapter, someone who can provide context for the world and hint at the broader conflict or quests to come. James: Agreed. A secondary character will balance Kalem's solo journey with some dialogue and potential camaraderie. It'd also be a good opportunity to demonstrate Kalem's newfound language skills. Bob: Great plan. So, we've got a solid outline for chapter one. Let's flesh it out, ensuring it's engaging and pays attention to pacing. I'll start drafting the creature encounter and his initial skill choice. James: And I'll handle the introduction of the secondary character and wrap up the chapter with a compelling hook. We'll make sure Kalem's voice remains consistent, highlighting his genre awareness and unique mindset. Bob: Let's get to writing then. By the end of this chapter, our readers should be fully invested in Kalem's adventure!"},{"prompt":"Continue. Also if it seems like you are nearing the end of your reply, give yourself the command to \\"Continue.\\"","completion":"Bob: I've come up with a tense encounter that should be a good test for Kalem. Here's the battle scene: \`\`\`txt Kalem edged through the dense underbrush, ears pricked for any sound of danger. Yet nothing in his brief, yet intense study of this world's lore had prepared him for the sight that now confronted him—a creature with the body of a boar but the barbed fur of a porcupine. It snarled, and Kalem knew instinctively it saw him as prey. He recalled the Skills Shop, the list of abilities that now had life-or-death significance. His mind raced. Archery? No, he lacked both a bow and the space to put distance between them. Pugilism it was, then. Simple, close-range, and something he had a basic grasp of, at least in theory. With a shaky breath, Kalem selected the skill, feeling a rush of information flow through him. His body responded with newfound confidence as he sidestepped the charging creature, delivering a well-placed strike that surprised both him and his adversary. The battle was clumsy, fraught with near misses and adrenaline-fueled desperation, but eventually, the creature lay defeated at his feet. [+25 exp] A chime signaled his minor triumph—small but significant in this vast and unknown world. His heart pounded, not just from exertion but the exhilarating realization that he had grown stronger. Kalem's resolve hardened; he would survive this world and perhaps, in time, even master it. \`\`\` James: Love the urgency and Kalem's reactive thinking there. Now for his meeting with the secondary character. I think a wandering merchant or a wise old sage would be cliché. How about a local scout who mistakes him for a new recruit or an out-of-place traveler? That would give us some natural dialogue and the introduction of the world from a resident's perspective. Bob: A scout is good. Works well with Kalem's need to learn the lay of the land. Plus, an expert in survival skills can inadvertently guide him on what skills might be useful to pick up next. Here's my take on their introduction: \`\`\`txt As Kalem stood catching his breath, he sensed rather than heard the approach of another. Spinning around, he found himself face to face with a lithe figure clad in leathers, a bow slung expertly over her shoulder. Her eyes narrowed as she regarded him, a mix of suspicion and curiosity playing across her features. \\"You're far from the usual paths, newcomer. Speak your business,\\" she demanded, her tone leaving no room for prevarication. Kalem's new language skills kicked in, and he marveled at the fluency with which he responded. \\"I'm—I'm just a bit lost,\\" he explained, opting for honesty. \\"My name's Kalem, and I've found myself here rather unexpectedly.\\" She studied him for a long moment, then seemed to come to a decision. \\"Evelyn,\\" she introduced herself. \\"Scout for the River's Bend Village. I suppose I can lead you to safety, but we've no time for dawdling. There are greater beasts than the one you've just slain in these parts.\\" Thankful for the assistance but wary of the implications, Kalem fell into step beside her. As they walked, Evelyn shared knowledge of Eldoria's geography, its people, and the dangers lurking beyond civilization's fragile edges. \`\`\` James: That does a lot of heavy lifting—nice work. Establishes an ally and begins world-building. Now for the hook. We need something that'll make readers desperate for chapter two. I'm considering an imminent threat or a mysterious event nearby. What if they stumble upon a scene of destruction that hints at a larger conflict? Bob: Yeah, a looming threat works great. It should be mysterious enough to pique curiosity but tangible enough to stir fear. Maybe an artifact or a sign symbolizing the impending turmoil. Our genre-savvy Kalem would know that an adventure is calling. Go ahead and draft that, and let's ensure we end the chapter with Kalem reflecting on his new reality, vowing to learn more about this world and rise to its challenges. James: Here's the attempt: \`\`\`txt The shadows grew longer as Kalem and Evelyn approached a clearing. Their conversation was abruptly cut short by the sight before them—a caravan, or what was left of it. Burnt-out wagons, strewn possessions, and the ominous absence of survivors painted a dire picture. \\"This was done by the Ashen Raiders,\\" Evelyn whispered, anger seething in her voice. \\"Brigands with a taste for fire and chaos. But this... this is bolder than their usual fare.\\" Kalem's eyes were drawn to a blackened staff half-buried in the ash. A symbol glowed faintly on its surface, one that sparked recognition in his trivia-laden mind. He'd seen it before, in the pages of a book he presumed was purely fictional. As he voiced his recognition, Evelyn gave him a sharp look. \\"You know something of the Raiders' marks?\\" \\"Not exactly,\\" Kalem replied, his mind working overtime. \\"But I have an idea—stories, myths from my world that I never imagined could be real.\\" Taking in Evelyn's grim expression and the devastation surrounding them, Kalem felt the weight of this adventure settle upon his shoulders. He had sought a break from the monotony, and fate had answered with a full-blown saga. \\"I need to learn all I can,\\" Kalem resolved, gripping the system window that fluttered at the edge of his vision. Skills, abilities, knowledge—he would harness them all, for his survival and perhaps for the sake of Eldoria itself. [Quest Mode Unlocked] An audible chime marked the end of chapter one, and the beginning of Kalem's quest to unravel the truth behind the myths that now intertwined with his reality. \`\`\` Bob: That's an excellent cliffhanger, James. It gives us a lot to work with for the next chapter. We've got our protagonist established, a taste of the RPG system in action, a budding alliance, and a conflict brewing. Kalem's about to dive headfirst into his newfound fate. James: Chapter one seems solid to me. We've got the pacing right, and it's action-packed but also takes the time to build the world around Kalem. I think we should go through it once more to tighten up the writing before moving on to chapter two. Bob: Agreed. Let's get this polished and then jump onto the next part of Kalem's journey. Can't wait to see where this story takes us—and him. James: Same here. It's going to be an epic tale. Alright, back to editing for now. End of Chapter One.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"tell me about the historical importance of the concept of resilience","completion":"The concept of resilience has a long history and has been examined from various perspectives throughout human history. Here are a few key points about the historical importance of the concept of resilience: 1. Ancient civilizations: Resilience can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as Babylon, Egypt, and Greece. Philosophers and thinkers in these societies emphasized the importance of resilience in personal and societal contexts. For example, the Stoic philosophers in ancient Greece, like Epictetus and Seneca, focused on cultivating inner strength and resilience in the face of adversity. 2. Evolutionary biology: Resilience is not limited to human societies; it also plays a crucial role in the natural world. The concept of resilience can be seen in the study of ecosystems and evolutionary biology. Ecologists examine how ecosystems recover and adapt after disturbances like natural disasters or human intervention. 3. Psychology and psychosocial development: In the field of psychology, resilience gained significant attention in the mid-20th century. Researchers explored how individuals cope with and recover from traumatic experiences, such as war, poverty, or loss. The concept of resilience became central to understanding human adaptation and development. 4. Resilience in social systems: Resilience is not just an individual attribute; it is also relevant to understanding the resilience of social systems, organizations, and communities. Conceptualizing resilience in this context helps in analyzing how societies respond and adapt to crises, such as economic recessions, natural disasters, or political upheavals. 5. Current focus on resilience: In recent years, resilience has gained renewed interest as societies face complex challenges like climate change, pandemics, and social inequality. Governments, organizations, and communities are looking for ways to build resilience at multiple levels to mitigate the impacts of such crises and maintain stability. In summary, the concept of resilience has a long historical importance, ranging from ancient philosophical traditions to modern-day scientific research and societal applications. Its significance lies in understanding how individuals, ecosystems, and societies adapt and thrive in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"since 1900, has the concept of resilience become more important then the concept of uncertainty_","completion":"The concepts of resilience and uncertainty are both highly relevant and interconnected. While it is difficult to definitively compare their importance, it can be argued that the significance of resilience has increased in recent times due to several factors: 1. Increasing complexity and interconnectedness: In the 20th century, the world has become more interconnected and complex. Technological advancements, globalization, and rapid changes in various sectors have brought about increased uncertainty. In response, understanding and building resilience has gained importance as societies and individuals seek ways to adapt and thrive in unpredictable and rapidly changing environments. 2. Global challenges: Humanity has faced numerous global challenges since the 1900s, such as world wars, economic recessions, natural disasters, and pandemics. These events have highlighted the need for resilience in coping with and recovering from such crises. Resilience is seen as crucial for mitigating the impacts of uncertain events and building capacity to bounce back more effectively. 3. Sustainability and climate change: The recognition of the long-term consequences of climate change has elevated the importance of resilience. Uncertainty accompanies climate change projections, but building resilience is necessary to enhance adaptive capacity, reduce vulnerability, and respond effectively to the changing environment. Resilience thinking is integrated into climate change adaptation strategies. 4. Mental health and well-being: The understanding of resilience has expanded beyond the physical domain to include psychological and emotional resilience. Mental health challenges, stress, and traumatic experiences have become more prevalent concerns in modern society. Recognizing and nurturing psychological resilience is considered essential for navigating uncertain situations while maintaining well-being. While both resilience and uncertainty are important concepts, the focus on resilience has increased in recent decades due to the recognition of its value in navigating uncertainty, adapting to challenges, and maintaining stability. However, it's worth noting that uncertainty remains a fundamental aspect of resilience, as it requires the ability to respond and adapt in the face of unknown or unpredictable circumstances."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Both brands have distinct styles and legacies that continue to attract a wide range of fashion enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"Can you explain to me the difference between a dependency model and an inter-dependency model?","completion":"Certainly! The concepts of dependency and interdependency models are often used to understand and analyze relationships between entities or systems. Here's an explanation of the difference between the two: 1. Dependency Model: In a dependency model, the focus is on a one-way relationship where one entity or system relies on another for its functioning or success. This unidirectional relationship implies that the dependent entity is reliant on the other entity, and any impact or change in the latter directly affects the former. The relationship is often asymmetrical, with one entity having more control or power over the other. A classic example is a customer and a supplier: the customer is dependent on the supplier for products but does not directly affect the supplier's operations. 2. Interdependency Model: In an interdependency model, the focus shifts to a mutual or reciprocal relationship between entities or systems. Here, the entities or systems rely on one another, and their functioning or success is interconnected and interrelated. The relationship is marked by a bidirectional flow of influence, where each entity or system has an impact on the other. Interdependencies acknowledge that actions by one entity can have repercussions on another. An example of interdependency is a team working together on a project. Each team member's contributions affect and depend on the contributions of others, and the team's output is a result of their collective efforts. In summary, the key difference between a dependency model and an interdependency model lies in the nature of the relationship between entities or systems. Dependency models focus on one-way reliance, whereas interdependency models emphasize a mutual and reciprocal relationship where entities or systems are interconnected and interrelated."},{"prompt":"Modèle d'une lettre de motivation adresser au secrétaire général de l'académie","completion":"[Prénom et Nom] [Adresse] [Téléphone] [email] [Date] Monsieur/Madame [Prénom et Nom du Secrétaire Général de l'Académie] Adresse de l'Académie Code Postal Ville Objet: Lettre de motivation pour un poste à l'Académie Monsieur/Madame le Secrétaire Général, Je me permets de vous adresser ma candidature pour un poste au sein de l'Académie [Nom de l'Académie] en tant que [intitulé du poste].

Мне не доступно выполнение кода, а также нет информации о контексте, в котором этот код будет использоваться. Однако я могу предложить аудит вашего кода и указать на некоторые моменты, которые могут потребовать внимания или изменений: 1. Проверка цены (\`CheckPrice()\`) - Код делает снимок экрана определенной области и проверяет, соответствует ли цвет определенному цвету \\"нашего\\" числа. - Адресация пикселя для проверки цвета (\`bmp.GetPixel(98, 18)\`) предполагает, что размер области для снимка фиксирован и никогда не изменится. Убедитесь, что координаты для этого пикселя всегда указывают на правильное место изображения в разных ситуациях (изменение разрешения экрана, изменение интерфейса приложения и т. д.). 2. Плавное движение курсора (\`SmoothMove()\`) - Код использует кривые Безье для плавного перехода курсора между координатами. Убедитесь, что эта функция не нарушает работы приложения, а также что время ожидания (\`Thread.Sleep(1)\`) не слишком велико или слишком мало для вашего конкретного случая. 3. Распознавание и улучшение изображения (\`EnhanceImage()\`, \`ConvertToGrayscale()\`) - Код увеличивает изображение и преобразует его в оттенки серого. Убедитесь, что этот процесс действительно улучшает результаты OCR. 4. Оптическое распознавание символов (OCR) и преобразование цены (\`RecognizeNumberAndAddOne()\`) - Для OCR используется библиотека Tesseract. Убедитесь, что у вас правильно задан путь к \`tessdata\` и что он содержит необходимые данные для вашего языка. - В методе есть блок обработки исключений (\`catch\`), но он просто показывает сообщение об ошибке. Возможно, вам потребуется более сложная логика обработки ошибок в зависимости от контекста. 5. Изменение цены (\`ChangePrice()\`) - Код предполагает определенные координаты для кликов мышью, которые должны изменять цену. Убедитесь, что координаты точек (\`pointsToMove\`) соответствуют месту элементов на экране в вашем приложении. Обратите внимание, что многие функции, используемые в коде (например, \`SetCursorPos\`, \`mouse_event\`), могут требовать добавления соответствующих директив \`using\`, а также ссылок на сборки или подключения библиотек Windows API. В коде также используются объекты \`Bitmap\` и \`Graphics\`, для которых нужно подключить пространство имен \`System.Drawing\`. Также учтите вопросы безопасности и стабильности: автоматическое управление курсором и вводом данных может быть потенциально заблокировано системными механизмами защиты от автоматизированных вредоносных действий.

При запуске программы, она потребляет 16 Мб память, после нажатия кнопки, которая запускает метод CheckPrice потребление памяти резко возрстает до 90 Мб, как это можно исправить?","completion":"Увеличение потребления памяти при запуске метода \`CheckPrice()\` может быть связано с созданием и обработкой изображений. Видно, что в вашем методе используются несколько инструкций \`using\`, которые должны гарантировать освобождение ресурсов используемых объектов \`Bitmap\`, когда они больше не нужны. Тем не менее, могут быть и другие причины утечки памяти. Вот несколько потенциальных факторов и способов их оптимизации: 1. **Объекты Graphics и Bitmap**: Убедитесь, что все используемые объекты \`Graphics\` и \`Bitmap\` находятся в блоках \`using\`, чтобы они были корректно уничтожены после использования. 2. **Ресурсы OCR и Tesseract**: Библиотека Tesseract может быть ресурсоемкой при инициализации и выполнении OCR. Если возможно, инициализируйте \`TesseractEngine\` один раз и переиспользуйте его, вместо того чтобы создавать новый объект при каждом вызове \`CheckPrice()\`. 3. **Процессорные операции над изображениями**: Операции по усилению изображения и бинаризации черно-белого изображения могут быть ресурсоемкими. Проверьте, нужно ли вам повторять эти операции при каждом вызове \`CheckPrice()\`. Возможно, определенные операции стоит выполнять только при конкретных условиях или кэшировать результаты для повторного использования. 4. **Необработанные исключения и утечки**: Ошибки и исключения в коде также могут вызывать утечки памяти, если не все объекты корректно освобождаются. Убедитесь, что у вас есть правильно настроенные блоки обработки исключений и что ресурсы освобождаются при любых условиях выхода из методов. 5. **Сборщик мусора**: Сборщик мусора (Garbage Collector - GC) в C# может отложить освобождение памяти для больших объектов. Если вы испытываете задержки в освобождении памяти, можно попробовать вызвать \`GC.Collect()\`, чтобы стимулировать GC пройтись по неиспользуемым объектам. Однако используйте этот метод с осторожностью, так как он может негативно влиять на производительность. 6. **Профилировщик памяти**: Воспользуйтесь профилировщиком памяти, чтобы точно определить причину увеличения потребления памяти. Это поможет вам увидеть, какие объекты занимают наибольший объём памяти и в какой момент. Как правило, лучшим подходом будет обнаружение и исправление точных причин утечки памяти, вместо искусственного вызова сборщика мусора или других \\"костыльных\\" решений. Используйте инструменты для профилирования и анализа памяти, такие как Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools, чтобы выявить источники утечек, и оптимизируйте свой код для лучшего управления ресурсами."},{"prompt":"Please create an alternate version of this prompt by changing one detail of your choice to improve the quality of the output, with the exception of Cognitive-Social Dynamics.

Your case studies include varied social networks encompassing cognitive psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each cluster of professionals contributes distinct insights, specialized skills, and various strategies for navigating intricate phenomena. Change Made: I changed \\"problem-solving abilities\\" to \\"decision-making abilities\\" and \\"computational analysts\\" to \\"data scientists\\". Justification for the Changes: The justification for changing \\"problem-solving abilities\\" to \\"decision-making abilities\\" stems from the desire to broaden the scope of cognitive functions that can be influenced by social networks. Problem-solving is a specific subset of cognitive ability, while decision-making encompasses a wider range of cognitive processes that include not only problem-solving but also the evaluation of choices, judgment, and the ability to make choices under uncertainty. By discussing decision-making, the lecture could now also incorporate elements of behavioral economics, risk assessment, and the impact of groupthink, thus making the field more interdisciplinary and potentially more interesting to the audience. Changing \\"computational analysts\\" to \\"data scientists\\" was made because the term \\"data scientists\\" is more broadly recognized and encapsulates a wide array of data analysis skills, including but not limited to computational analysis. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves algorithms, data inference, and technology in addition to methodologies from statistics, which would be relevant in analyzing social networks and their impact on cognition. Using the term \\"data scientists\\" implies an integration of computational methods with statistical, predictive, and machine learning methods, which are essential in modern analyses of social networks. By implying a more modern and comprehensive field, this may engage the audience more effectively and give credence to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive-Social Dynamics."},{"prompt":"what module contains the save function to save a trained AI model","completion":"The module containing the \`save\` function to save a trained AI model really depends on the framework or library you are using for machine learning or deep learning. Below are a few examples of how to save models in popular libraries: 1. **TensorFlow/Keras**: In TensorFlow's Keras API, you can save a whole model using the \`save\` method on a Keras model object. \`\`\`python model.save('my_model.h5') # HDF5 file \`\`\` You can also save just the weights or the architecture separately if you prefer. \`\`\`python model.save_weights('my_model_weights.h5') with open('model_architecture.json', 'w') as f: f.write(model.to_json()) \`\`\` 2. **PyTorch**: In PyTorch, saving a model usually involves saving the state dictionary rather than the whole model. This is done using \`torch.save\`. \`\`\`python torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model_weights.pth') \`\`\` To save the entire model, which is not generally recommended because of potential issues with serialization: \`\`\`python torch.save(model, 'model_complete.pth') \`\`\` 3. **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn models can be saved using the \`joblib\` module or \`pickle\`. \`\`\`python from joblib import dump, load dump(model, 'model.joblib') \`\`\` Alternatively, with \`pickle\`: \`\`\`python import pickle with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as file: pickle.dump(model, file) \`\`\` 4. **XGBoost**: XGBoost models can be saved using its native \`save_model\` function. \`\`\`python bst.save_model('model.json') # or 'model.bin' \`\`\` 5. **LightGBM**: Like XGBoost, you can save LightGBM models natively: \`\`\`python gbm.save_model('model.txt') # or other supported formats \`\`\` Be sure to follow the recommended best practices for saving your specific type of model, as the above are general guidelines.

This attempt at an alternative approach is adapted from Andrej Karpathy's notebooks on his minGPT project, which serve as a basis for learning about and experimenting with simple GPT models. **Key Components & Functionality:** 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** - The script expects a text file named \`universe.txt\` which it reads and processes to obtain a unique set of characters that determine the vocabulary of the model. - It creates mappings between characters to integers (\`stoi\`) and integers to characters (\`itos\`). - The dataset is divided into training (first 90%) and validation (remaining 10%). 2. **Model Definition (\`GPTLanguageModel\`):** - Instead of self-attention blocks, the script uses modified \`Block\` classes with \`MultiHeadAttention\` replaced by \`Head\` which uses direct reweighting. - The \`Head\` class constructs a reweighting mechanism using a linear layer plus a nonlinear ReLU layer and another linear layer. This replaces the typical query-key-value mechanism of standard self-attention layers. - The \`FeedForward\` layer remains unchanged and offers the token mixing within each sequence after the modified attention mechanism. 3. **Training Loop:** - The training process iterates for \`max_iters\` iterations. - At every \`eval_interval\`, the script evaluates the model on both the training and validation data to report the loss. - The model updates its weights using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate defined at the start. 4. **Generation:** - After training, the model can be used to generate text. The generation process is based on sampling tokens one by one and appending them to the context. 5. **Saving the Model:** - After training and generation, the model's parameters are saved using PyTorch's \`torch.save\` method to a file named \\"Universe-GPT.pth\\". **Report on Execution:** - Before running the script, the text file \`universe.txt\` needs to be present in the \`data\` directory. - The script sets the random seed for reproducibility and makes use of GPU acceleration if available. - Hyperparameters such as batch size, block size, number of layers (\`n_layer\`), number of heads (\`n_head\`), embedding size (\`n_embd\`), and a number of hidden nodes (\`hidden_nodes\`) for the reweighting layer are specified. - The model's parameter count is printed before the training starts. It is then trained and evaluated at specified intervals. - Text is generated by the trained model as the last part of the script. - There are some potential issues and limitations within the script, such as hardcoded file paths, lack of command-line argument support, and the assumption that CUDA is available for GPU use. - It is important to note the absence of model evaluation metrics beyond loss, which might be essential to understand the model's performance better. Also, there is no detailed error handling or input validation. Keep in mind that this report is based on static analysis of the code and assumes that the script is run in an environment with all requirements met. Running the code would potentially surface runtime errors or other issues not apparent in a static analysis."},{"prompt":"Can you report any bugs, suggestions or rewrites ?","completion":"Upon examining the provided code, here are some observations, potential issues, and suggestions for improvement: **Potential Issues/Bugs:** 1. **File Handling:** - The script assumes the existence of a file \`data/universe.txt\`. If the file is not present, the script will raise an error. Robust file handling with appropriate exception catching should be added. 2. **Data Preprocessing:** - The unique characters are extracted from the text file without lowercasing or any other preprocessing. Depending on the use case, you may want to preprocess the text for consistent casing or to remove non-essential characters. 3. **Device Handling:** - The device is set globally to 'cuda' if available, or 'cpu' otherwise. While this is generally okay, you should ensure that all tensors and models are explicitly transferred to the correct device to avoid runtime errors. 4. **Hardcoded Hyperparameters:** - Hyperparameters are hardcoded in the script, which means for any modification, you must manually change the code. A more robust approach would be using an argument parser to provide these values when running the script. 5. **Potential Division by Zero:** - In the \`Head\` class's \`forward\` method, the mask applies \`float('-inf')\` to certain positions. If any errors arise with \`F.softmax\` that relate to NaNs or division by zero, it may be necessary to ensure numerical stability by adding a small epsilon value where appropriate. 6. **Global Position Embeddings:** - Position embeddings assume a maximum block size and do not account for sequences that may be shorter or longer. If variable-length sequences are to be handled, more dynamic position embedding handling should be introduced. **Suggestions:** 1. **Enhance File Handling:** - Check if the file exists and throw a user-friendly error message if not. \`\`\`python import os if not os.path.isfile('data/universe.txt'): raise FileNotFoundError(\\"Data file 'universe.txt' not found in 'data/' directory.\\") \`\`\` 2. **Argument Parsing:** - Use \`argparse\` for hyperparameters and file paths to make the script more user-friendly and versatile. \`\`\`python import argparse parser = argparse.ArgumentParser() parser.add_argument('--batch_size', type=int, default=96, help='Batch size') # ... add other arguments args = parser.parse_args() \`\`\` 3. **Improve Model Initialization:** - The \`_init_weights\` method initializes biases to zero, which is fine for a linear layer but potentially suboptimal for embeddings or other parameters not covered. Ensure proper initialization across all trainable parameters. 4. **Evaluation Metric Improvements:** - Implement additional evaluation metrics apart from loss, such as perplexity, accuracy, or BLEU score for the language model. 5. **Training Stability:** - The script lacks gradient clipping, which is a common practice to prevent the exploding gradient problem in training RNNs and Transformers. 6. **Code Comments:** - The script could benefit from more comments to explain why certain design choices are made, particularly around the modified attention mechanism and its impact on how the model processes sequences. 7. **Saving and Loading Models:** - You may want to include code to load the model from the saved state for evaluation or further training. 8. **Variable-Length Sequences Handling:** - The model assumes fixed-length context windows (\`block_size\`). For deployment or using sequences of varying lengths, modifications are required to handle this, potentially by using padding tokens and attention masks. **Rewrites/Simplifications:** - Simplification is not strictly necessary, but the code might be made more modular by separating data preprocessing, model definition, training, and generation into different functions or classes, enhancing readability and maintainability. The code doesn't seem to have critical bugs at first glance, but it would require running tests with appropriate datasets and evaluation methods to fully verify its correctness and performance in practice."},{"prompt":"Can you generate code to make inference with the trained model","completion":"Certainly! To perform inference with the trained model, you can follow these steps to create a function that loads the saved model and generates text based on an initial context.

Typically, you would save \`stoi\` and \`itos\` when training the model and load them back during inference. - The number of new tokens to generate is given by \`max_new_tokens\`. - The function generates one token at a time and updates the context sequence with the newly generated token for each iteration. Remember that you need to have prepared the \`stoi\`, \`itos\`, \`encode\`, and \`decode\` utilities that you had during training for this to work.

To accentuate the relevance of this novel field, you are formulating a lecture to elucidate its connection with evolving societal dynamics. An essential component of your talk will be the exploration of how online social networks shape cognitive abilities and the fabric of human interactions, incorporating empirical studies to substantiate your arguments. Your case studies include varied social networks encompassing cognitive psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each cluster of professionals contributes distinct insights, specialized skills, and various strategies for navigating intricate phenomena. Justification for change: The term \\"burgeoning\\" suggests that the discipline is rapidly growing and becoming more important, but it may still be very much in its infancy and not well-established. By changing it to \\"emerging interdisciplinary field,\\" I intend to communicate that Cognitive-Social Dynamics is not only growing but also crossing traditional boundaries between established disciplines. This better emphasizes the collaborative nature of the field and suggests a more mature level of development where substantial work has already been done to integrate different scientific perspectives. Moreover, the term \\"interdisciplinary\\" immediately signals the reader that scholars from multiple fields contribute to the body of knowledge, which aligns seamlessly with the later mention of cognitive psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists working together. This also implies a level of complexity and richness in the field that a simple description of it as a \\"burgeoning discipline\\" might not convey. Using \\"emerging interdisciplinary field\\" also hints at more robust and diverse methodological approaches, theoretical frameworks, and potentially more significant impacts on society, which are key when discussing the field's relevance to societal dynamics and the shaping of cognitive abilities by online social networks. This enhances the overall comprehension of the field's scope and significance for the audience of the lecture."},{"prompt":"asdas","completion":"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're asking.

Il sistema software dovrà essere di supporto sia ai proprietari delle società che agli autisti di taxi che lavorano presso la società che ai clienti che vogliono effettuare una prenotazione. Un taxi può essere guidato da più autisti, ma solo uno è il referente per la società e bisogna sempre sapere qual è il taxi guidato da ciascun autista. Per ogni autista, oltre ai dati anagrafici e recapiti, occorre disporre anche del numero della patente e la relativa data di scadenza. Anche dei taxi occorre mantenere le informazioni che consentano l’identificazione del veicolo, inclusa la cilindrata, il numero di posti disponibili e il chilometraggio. Si noti che gli autisti neopatentati non possono guidare taxi che hanno una cilindrata superiore ad una determinata soglia. I taxi possono essere prenotati dai clienti e a ogni prenotazione è associato un codice di prenotazione, la data, l’ora, il luogo per cui è stata fatta la richiesta, il numero di persone, nonché il taxi assegnato. Si noti che il numero di persone non può superare il numero dei posti disponibili nel taxi. Per ogni corsa effettuata occorre memorizzare la data e l’ora in cui è stata effettuata, la durata, il luogo di partenza e di arrivo, e l’importo della corsa. Occorre anche tener conto che la società possono stipulare delle convenzioni con alcuni particolari clienti, al fine di ottenere degli sconti. In tal caso, per ogni corsa, occorre memorizzare anche il codice del cliente e il numero di persone presenti nella vettura insieme al cliente (convenzionato). Il sistema deve gestire la disponibilità dei taxi: quando un autista accetta una prenotazione il sistema deve aggiornare lo stato del taxi come “prenotato” e rimuoverlo dalla lista dei taxi disponibili. Quando un autista inizia una corsa, il sistema deve aggiornare lo stato del taxi come \\"occupato\\". Al termine della corsa o se il cliente non si presenta sul luogo dell'appuntamento entro 10 minuti dall’ora della prenotazione, il taxi diventa nuovamente \\"disponibile\\" e viene incluso nella lista dei taxi disponibili per altre prenotazioni. Il sistema deve consentire ai proprietari delle società di inserire le date delle revisioni per ciascun taxi. Quando viene effettuata una revisione per un taxi, il sistema deve consentire all'addetto alla revisione di registrare i dettagli della revisione entro 3 giorni dalla data effettiva della revisione. Ciò include la registrazione della data, dell'orario, del risultato della revisione e delle eventuali azioni correttive necessarie. Il sistema deve tenere traccia delle scadenze delle revisioni e inviare notifiche agli amministratori, agli autisti e ai referenti dei taxi quando una revisione è imminente (una settimana prima e il giorno prima).

Ecco un'esemplificazione del pattern: \`\`\`java // Stato generico di un taxi. interface TaxiState { void prenota(Taxi taxi, Prenotazione prenotazione); void iniziaCorsa(Taxi taxi); void terminaCorsa(Taxi taxi); } // Implementazione concreta di uno stato disponibile per un taxi. class DisponibileState implements TaxiState { @Override public void prenota(Taxi taxi, Prenotazione prenotazione) { taxi.setStato(new PrenotatoState()); // Logica per la prenotazione... } @Override public void iniziaCorsa(Taxi taxi) { // Non applicabile se è già disponibile throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"Il taxi deve essere prenotato prima di iniziare una corsa.\\"); } @Override public void terminaCorsa(Taxi taxi) { // Non applicabile se è già disponibile throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"Non c'è nessuna corsa da terminare.\\"); } } // Implementazione concreta di uno stato prenotato per un taxi. class PrenotatoState implements TaxiState { @Override public void prenota(Taxi taxi, Prenotazione prenotazione) { // Non applicabile se è già prenotato throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"Il taxi è già prenotato.\\"); } @Override public void iniziaCorsa(Taxi taxi) { taxi.setStato(new OccupatoState()); // Logica per iniziare una corsa... } @Override public void terminaCorsa(Taxi taxi) { taxi.setStato(new DisponibileState()); // Logica per terminare una corsa... } } // Implementazione concreta di uno stato occupato per un taxi. class OccupatoState implements TaxiState { // ... } // Classe contesto che rappresenta il taxi. class Taxi { private TaxiState stato; private String targa; // Altri attributi come cilindrata, autista, ecc. public Taxi() { stato = new DisponibileState(); // Inizialmente il taxi è disponibile } public void prenota(Prenotazione prenotazione) { stato.prenota(this, prenotazione); } public void iniziaCorsa() { stato.iniziaCorsa(this); } public void terminaCorsa() { stato.terminaCorsa(this); } public void setStato(TaxiState stato) { this.stato = stato; } // Metodi aggiuntivi... } // Classe che rappresenta una prenotazione. class Prenotazione { // Dettagli sulla prenotazione come codice, data/ora, luogo, ecc. } \`\`\` Questo modello facilita l'aggiunta o la modifica di comportamenti specifici dello stato senza modificare la classe \`Taxi\`, tenendo separata la logica di comportamento dallo stato effettivo. Gli stati possono essere aggiunti o modificati in modo indipendente con impatto minimo sul resto del codice. Inoltre, il pattern \\"State\\" aiuta a evitare l'uso eccessivo di istruzioni condizionali disordinate per controllare i vari stati di un taxi. Ogni stato concreto sa cosa fare quando vengono chiamate le sue azioni: \`prenota\`, \`iniziaCorsa\`, e \`terminaCorsa\`. Nel contesto della classe \`Taxi\`, gli stati vengono cambiati dinamicamente in base agli eventi che accadono."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They had been married for five years, and their love had been the kind that poets and songwriters dream of capturing in their work. As the years passed, however, the sparkle in their eyes began to dim. Tom's job at the local bank demanded most of his time, leaving Sarah feeling lonely and neglected in their once vibrant home. She filled her days with walks in the woods, painting, and occasional coffee with friends, but nothing could shake the growing sense of isolation within her. One fateful evening, Sarah's high school sweetheart, Michael, returned to the village. His unexpected appearance stirred feelings she thought were long buried. Michael was charismatic and attentive, in stark contrast to the distant Tom, and soon, Sarah found herself engaged in a dangerous affair, carried away by the exhilarating rush of forbidden love. One day, Michael convinced Sarah that they were meant to be together, that life was too short to be spent in the shadow of neglect. In a whirlwind of emotion, Sarah agreed to leave with him, to start anew far away from the sleepy confines of the village. On the eve of their planned departure, Sarah was packing her last belongings when she found an old photo album. Page after page, she was reminded of the love she and Tom had shared: their wedding day, their travels, the cozy nights by the fireplace. Memories flooded back, and doubt seeped into her heart. Had she truly fallen out of love with Tom? Or had the loneliness simply clouded her judgment? She decided to confront Tom, to give their love one last chance. Tom arrived home to find Sarah sitting in the dimly lit living room, her eyes red from crying. Bracing for the worst, Sarah confessed her affair to Tom, her voice barely above a whisper. She expected anger, disappointment, or even a fierce argument. Instead, she was met with an unfathomable calm. Tom took a deep breath and then revealed a truth that turned Sarah's world upside down. He had been aware of the affair for some time. He had noticed the changes in Sarah, the secretive phone calls, the distant gaze. Instead of confronting her, Tom had decided to fight for their marriage in silence. He had been working tirelessly to secure a promotion at the bank that would grant him more time at home and a chance to rekindle their love. Sarah was speechless. The guilt of her infidelity weighed heavily on her, but it was Tom's act of quiet devotion that shattered her heart into a million pieces. She had been so consumed by her own loneliness that she had failed to see the efforts of the man who had pledged to share a life with her. The air was thick with silence until Tom, with tears in his eyes, presented her with two plane tickets. Confused, Sarah looked at them. They were not tickets for her and Michael's escape, but for a trip to Paris, a dream they had shared since their honeymoon. Tom had been planning a surprise second honeymoon to reignite the passion they once had. With the truth laid bare, Michael's allure faded, and Sarah saw the love she had for Tom, patient and unwavering. She chose to stay, to rebuild the trust and love with her husband, pledging to never again take it for granted. As life returned to normal, with Tom and Sarah growing closer each day, the true plot twist was revealed to the villagers: Michael was no ordinary man but rather an actor, hired by Tom himself, to test the strength of their marriage. Tom had feared that Sarah was slipping away from him and had wanted to remind her of what they once had. The story of their unconventional journey to find each other again became a legend in the village, a tale of a love that withstood the greatest test of all, and emerged stronger and more devoted than ever before."},{"prompt":"what did the charaters look like","completion":"Let's enhance our story with a vivid depiction of the characters: Sarah was a woman of grace and quiet beauty. She had flowing chestnut hair that she often wore in a loose braid over her shoulder. Her eyes were a warm hazel, reflecting the gentle spirit she possessed, and her smile was like a rare sighting of the sun on a cloudy day—when it appeared, it lit up her entire face. Slim and of average height, Sarah moved with an artist's elegance, her hands always betraying her creative nature through their subtle, expressive gestures. Tom was the archetype of a steadfast partner, with a sturdy frame built from years of rural living and outdoor hobbies. He stood at an impressive six feet with a broad-shouldered build that gave an air of dependability. His hair was short, a sandy blonde, and often carried the evidence of his hands running through it during moments of deep thought. His eyes, a deep-set blue, were like the clear skies of their village—trustworthy and serene. He wore his smiles less frequently, but when he did, they were genuine and heartwarming. Michael, the agent of chaos in their once peaceful life, was charmingly handsome in a roguish sort of way. He had dark, slicked-back hair that gave him an aura of the dashing adventurers from old novels. His eyes were a sharp green that seemed to pierce through one's defenses, and his smile, quick and sly, suggested a man used to getting what he wanted. He was tall, like Tom, but with a leaner build, a wolfish grace to his movements that suggested a life of spontaneity and impulse. Together, these three characters formed a triangle of warmth, strength, and intrigue against the backdrop of a simple village, their appearances playing just as much a part in their story as their emotions and choices."},{"prompt":"请总结《中国居民膳食指南科学研究报告2021》中和油脂有关的内容","completion":"《中国居民膳食指南科学研究报告2021》中与油脂有关的内容主要包括以下几个方面： 1. 膳食油的种类和摄入量：报告指出膳食油是人体营养所必需的能量来源，推荐选择植物油作为主要油脂摄入来源，如花生油、大豆油、葵花籽油、玉米油、橄榄油等。同时建议适量摄入少量的动物油，如牛油、羊油等。 2. 摄入油脂的量和比例：报告建议成年人每天摄入适量的膳食油，但具体摄入量应根据个体情况而定，一般可控制在适量的10-30克之间。同时，推荐合理控制油脂摄入量在总能量的20-30%之间，其中不饱和脂肪酸应占到摄入总脂肪酸的70%以上。 3. 油脂的选择和使用：报告提出了合理选择和使用油脂的建议。建议在不同用途中选择不同种类的油脂，如炒菜时选用耐热的植物油，凉拌或炖煮时可选用香椿油、亚麻籽油等，不建议过多使用油炸食品。同时，建议不同油脂的混合使用，以提高膳食油脂的多样性。 4. 油脂的品质和安全：报告重视膳食油的品质和安全问题，建议选择优质的油脂产品，如具有厂家标注、保质期明确、合法合规等相关证明的产品，并尽量避免使用过期、变质或次级油脂。 总的来说，《中国居民膳食指南科学研究报告2021》通过对油脂的种类、摄入量、比例、选择和使用等方面的分析和建议，旨在指导居民健康合理地摄入油脂，保证营养平衡和人体健康。"},{"prompt":"请结合人们的日常生活指出如何科学的摄入脂肪","completion":"科学摄入脂肪在人们的日常生活中是非常重要的，可以通过以下几个方面来实现： 1. 控制总脂肪摄入量：根据个体的能量需求和身体状况，合理控制总脂肪的摄入量。一般而言，脂肪应占总能量的20-30%。可以通过注意膳食中不同食物的脂肪含量，并合理进行搭配，来控制总体脂肪的摄入量。 2. 选择健康的脂肪来源：首选植物油作为主要的脂肪摄入来源，如花生油、大豆油、葵花籽油、玉米油、橄榄油等。这些植物油富含不饱和脂肪酸，对心血管健康有益。同时，也可以适量摄入少量的动物油，如牛油、羊油等，但要注意不要过量摄入，以免增加饱和脂肪酸的摄入量。 3. 平衡摄入不同种类的脂肪酸：不饱和脂肪酸，如Omega-3和Omega-6脂肪酸，是人体所需的重要脂肪。可以通过适量摄入鱼类、坚果、种子等富含 Omega-3脂肪酸的食物，同时保证摄入适量的 Omega-6脂肪酸，如黄豆、葵花籽等。 4. 合理使用油脂：在烹调食物时，应控制使用油脂的量，尽量采用低温慢炖、凉拌、蒸煮等健康烹调方式，减少摄入过多的油脂。同时，选择适宜的油脂种类，如烹调时选用高温稳定的植物油，如花生油、葵花籽油等。 5. 避免过度摄入食品中隐藏的不健康脂肪：一些加工食品中可能含有隐藏的不健康脂肪，如反式脂肪酸和饱和脂肪酸。因此，在选择食品时，应尽量避免选择含有过多反式脂肪酸和饱和脂肪酸的加工食品，多选择天然、新鲜的食物。 总的来说，科学摄入脂肪需要合理控制总脂肪摄入量、选择健康的脂肪来源、平衡摄入不同种类的脂肪酸、合理使用油脂和避免过度摄入不健康脂肪。同时，根据个体需要和健康状况，可以咨询营养师或者医生的建议，制定个性化的膳食计划。"},{"prompt":"请说明绍兴黄酒的发展传承","completion":"绍兴黄酒是中国著名的传统酒类之一，其发展传承有以下几个方面： 1. 悠久历史：绍兴黄酒有着悠久的历史，可以追溯至春秋时期。该地区的气候条件以及丰富的产米资源为黄酒的生产提供了有利条件。 2. 传统酿造工艺：绍兴黄酒以传统的酿造工艺著称，其工艺主要包括曲曲发酵、固态发酵、固态陈化等过程。这种传统的发酵工艺使得黄酒保留了丰富的酵母和谷物的香气成分，更加浓郁、醇和。 3. 独特风味：绍兴黄酒具有独特的风味特点，其口感醇厚，香气浓郁，带有谷物和酵母的香味，耐储存，并且随着时间的推移，其风味会更加丰富。 4. 重视传承：绍兴黄酒的传承一直很重要，酒坊往往将自家传统酿酒技艺代代相传，家族作坊也是绍兴黄酒传承发展的主力军。不少酒企还建立了专门的酿酒研究所来研究黄酒的酿造工艺和提升品质。 5. 现代营销推广：为了适应现代的市场需求，一些绍兴黄酒企业开始注重营销推广策略，通过品牌塑造、产品创新、包装升级等手段来提升绍兴黄酒的知名度和市场份额。 总的来说，绍兴黄酒的发展传承依靠着悠久的历史、传统酿造工艺、独特风味以及对传统工艺的重视和现代市场的适应。这些因素共同推动了绍兴黄酒在中国以及国际市场的发展与传承。"},{"prompt":"如果我想研究绍兴黄酒应该从那些角度研究","completion":"如果您想研究绍兴黄酒，可以从以下几个角度展开研究： 1. 历史与文化：绍兴黄酒有着悠久的历史和独特的文化背景。您可以研究其历史渊源、传统酿造技艺以及与当地文化和习俗的关系，探究其在绍兴地区的文化传承和地位。 2. 酿造工艺：绍兴黄酒的酿造工艺是其独特风味的关键。您可以研究绍兴黄酒的酿造方法、原料选择、发酵过程、陈化时间等方面，深入了解其酿造过程、技术要点和影响品质的因素。您还可以与酒坊、酒家、酿酒师等相关从业者进行交流和实地调研。 3. 风味与品质：绍兴黄酒的风味是其独特之处。您可以通过化学分析、感官评价等方法研究黄酒的成分组成、风味特点、口感特征等，并与其他类型的黄酒进行对比，探究绍兴黄酒的独特性与品质。 4. 健康与营养价值：黄酒作为一种传统的酒类饮品，具有一定的健康与营养价值。您可以研究黄酒中的营养成分，如氨基酸、多酚等，以及其对人体健康的影响，如抗氧化、促进消化等方面，为黄酒的健康功效提供科学支持。 5. 市场与消费：研究绍兴黄酒的市场现状和消费特点可以了解黄酒的需求与趋势。您可以分析黄酒的市场发展情况、消费群体、价格策略、品牌竞争等，预测市场的发展趋势，并提出相关的营销与推广策略。 以上是研究绍兴黄酒时可以考虑的几个角度，您可以根据自己的兴趣和研究目的选择其中一个或多个方向进行深入研究。"},{"prompt":"请详细讲述绍兴黄酒的发展传承","completion":"绍兴黄酒是中国浙江绍兴地区的一种传统酒类，具有悠久的历史和独特的发展传承。以下是关于绍兴黄酒的发展传承的详细讲述： 1. 历史渊源：绍兴黄酒的历史可以追溯到春秋战国时期，距今已有两千多年的历史。传说中，战国时期的越国君主勾践曾在苏堤上下令采集桂花浸泡酒，这被认为是绍兴黄酒的起源。绍兴地区的气候条件和丰富的产米资源提供了有利条件，使得绍兴黄酒得以在这一地区逐渐发展壮大。 2. 传统酿造工艺：绍兴黄酒以其独特的传统酿造工艺而闻名。黄酒的酿造主要有曲曲发酵、固态发酵和固态陈化等过程。首先，通过曲曲发酵将发酵曲与糯米混合，使其产生发酵作用；其次，将发酵好的混合物进行窖藏，进行固态发酵；最后，固态陈化过程使酒液更加醇厚、香气更加浓郁。这种传统酿造工艺赋予了绍兴黄酒其独特的口感和香味。 3. 传承与家族酒坊：绍兴黄酒的传承主要依靠家族酒坊的力量。很多家族酒坊将酿酒技艺代代相传，通过家族秘方和世代传承的酿酒工艺，使得绍兴黄酒得以保存和发展。这些家族酒坊通常代代相传，注重技艺传承和酒坊文化的传承。 4. 重视研究与创新：在时代发展的推动下，绍兴黄酒也注重研究和创新，以适应现代市场的需求。一些酒企设立了专门的研究所，致力于传统酿造工艺的提升、新产品的研发和技术的创新。借助现代科技手段，绍兴黄酒得以更好地适应现代消费者的口味和需求。 5. 品牌推广与市场发展：为了提高黄酒的知名度和市场份额，绍兴黄酒开始注重品牌推广和市场营销。一些著名绍兴黄酒品牌通过品牌塑造、包装升级、推广活动等手段，不断扩大消费市场，将"},{"prompt":"Write a post for my blog in approximately 500 words, you can choose any of these topics: Software, Web, Front-end, Back-end, DevOps, MlOps, CI/CD, Automation, Scripting, Best practices.

In traditional logic, things are either true or false, but in fuzzy logic, there is a middle ground where things can be partially true or false. This flexibility allows for more nuanced decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. </p> <h2>Benefits of Fuzzy Logic in Software Development</h2> <p> One of the key benefits of fuzzy logic in software development is its ability to handle uncertainty. In many real-world scenarios, there is inherent uncertainty and imprecision, and fuzzy logic excels at dealing with these situations. For example, in a recommendation system, fuzzy logic can be used to assign a degree of relevance to different items based on user preferences. This ensures that the recommendations are personalized and tailored to each user's unique needs. </p> <p> Another advantage of fuzzy logic is its ability to handle incomplete or vague information. In traditional logic, if there is missing data or ambiguity, it can be challenging to make accurate decisions. Fuzzy logic, on the other hand, allows for the representation of partial information and can provide meaningful results even when the input is not precise. </p> <h2>Implementing Fuzzy Logic in Software Development</h2> <p> To implement fuzzy logic in software development, various tools and frameworks are available. One popular approach is to use fuzzy logic libraries or frameworks that provide pre-built functions and algorithms for fuzzy logic calculations. These libraries can simplify the implementation process and enable developers to leverage fuzzy logic in their applications without having to build everything from scratch. </p> <p> Additionally, machine learning algorithms can be combined with fuzzy logic to create powerful hybrid systems. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to extract patterns and relationships from data, while fuzzy logic can provide a framework for reasoning and decision-making. This combination allows for the development of intelligent systems that can handle complex and uncertain scenarios. </p> <h2>The Future of Fuzzy Logic in Software Development</h2> <p> As software development continues to evolve, the importance of fuzzy logic is bound to increase. The ability to handle uncertainty and imprecision will become more critical as applications become more complex and data-driven. Fuzzy logic has already made significant contributions in areas such as recommendation systems, intelligent automation, and decision support systems. It is expected that these applications will continue to expand, and fuzzy logic will play a pivotal role in their development. </p> <p> In conclusion, fuzzy logic is a valuable tool in software development. Its ability to handle uncertainty, imprecision, and incomplete information makes it applicable to a wide range of real-world scenarios. By implementing fuzzy logic in software development, developers can create more intelligent and robust applications that can adapt to changing situations and provide meaningful results. As the field of software development continues to evolve, the importance of fuzzy logic will only grow, making it an essential skill for developers to master. </p> </article> </body> </html>"},{"prompt":"In a hypothetical alternate timeline \\"The Traveller\\" in her second incarnation ( Hattie Jacques), encountered the \\"Cavern of Dreams\\", after a playful voice draws 'the old lady' the Traveller's time-space machine, into the realm of fiction and dreams.

The rules of play in the Cavern are twisted, and the nightmare only builds. ...","completion":"You've devised a fascinating concept that mixes elements from classic science fiction and fantasy stories, where The Traveller, as played by Hattie Jacques, encounters the Cavern of Dreams. Here is how we could imagine the story fleshing out within this alternate timeline serial: **Episode 1: \\"A Whisper Through Time\\"** In this black-and-white introduction, the Traveller—portrayed with a warm but stern matronly charm by Hattie Jacques—and her companions are lured into the Cavern of Dreams by a playful, almost childish voice permeating the fabric of time and space. It waxes lyrical about the joy of dreams and the power of stories, enticing them to enter the realm where reality is but fiction's shadow. **Episode 2: \\"Tales of Color and Chaos\\"** With a burst of vibrant color, the second episode would pay homage to the transition in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\", the travelers find themselves in a realm where the landscape itself is painted with the bright, surreal palette of dreams. The mundane laws of nature no longer apply, and the companions find themselves separated and dropped into different stories plucked from the depths of their own imaginations. **Episode 3: \\"Marionette's Labyrinth\\"** Here, the influence of \\"The Celestial Toymaker\\" would be felt as the companions navigate through a twisted toy theater, with each of them forced to play roles in macabre, marionette-led tales. The Traveller herself is coerced into a role as the puppeteer, where she must guide the narrative to ensure her companion's safety. **Episode 4: \\"Echos of the Mind\\"** Much like \\"The Mind Robber\\", the boundaries between thought and reality are blurred. The cavern seems to pulsate with psychic energy, bringing to life the innermost fears and fantasies of the travelers. Each must confront and outwit manifestations of their own psyche to regain coherence in the ever-shifting landscape. **Episode 5: \\"The Phantasmagorical Garden\\"** In this psychedelic episode, the travelers find themselves wandering through a kaleidoscopic wilderness. Flora and fauna of impossible colors and geometries populate this garden, a place of both exquisite beauty and insidious peril, where the dream logic of the Cavern is most potent. **Episode 6: \\"Awake!\\"** In the climactic episode, The Traveller and her companions must uncover the true nature of the Cavern and the entity behind the playful voice. The resolution may involve a clever twist of logic and emotion, a game of wits that sees them exploiting the fluid rules of the realm to forge a path back to their own reality. As they return, the world fades back to monochrome, but the memories of color and the lessons of the Cavern linger with The Traveller and her companions, who are now somewhat changed by their surreal adventure. The episode would end with The Traveller delivering a poignant monologue about the beauty and danger of dreams, the power of stories, and the thin veil between what is real and what is imagined."},{"prompt":"Possible cliffhangers for episodes? Obviously Epsidoe 1 ends with 'the old lady' (the time-space machine') landing in the 'Cavern' , with maybe the tardis doors opening as the final shot of the episode.","completion":"Here are potential cliffhangers for the episodes in your alternate timeline serial: **Episode 1: \\"A Whisper Through Time\\"** As you suggested, the cliffhanger for the first episode would be the moment the time-space machine, referred to affectionately as 'the old lady,' lands in the 'Cavern of Dreams'. The Traveller and her companions look out with trepidation as the TARDIS doors slowly creak open to reveal a blinding light that floods the interior. The playful voice that lured them in now giggles as it fades away, leaving viewers with a sense of ominous suspense. **Episode 2: \\"Tales of Color and Chaos\\"** For the ending of the second episode, as the companions have been scattered into their own dreamlike tales, the camera could focus on one companion, who stumbles upon an object of deep personal significance within their story. However, just as they reach for it, the object morphs into a sinister figure that lunges at the screen, and we cut to black. **Episode 3: \\"Marionette's Labyrinth\\"** In the labyrinth of marionettes, the cliffhanger could center on The Traveller herself. Just as she believes she has mastered the strings and is on the brink of rescuing her companions, the marionette version of the tale's protagonist suddenly turns toward her, its eyes glowing and its smile widening creepily. The puppet speaks in the ominous voice of the force controlling this realm, stating that no one controls the story but it, leaving The Traveller momentarily powerless. **Episode 4: \\"Echos of the Mind\\"** At the end of this episode, one by one, the companions manage to face and outwit their inner fears, but as they reconvene, they notice The Traveller is missing. A search leads them to a clearing where she's trapped within a translucent, dream-like bubble, her expression one of horror. The bubble begins to float away, taking her deeper into the Cavern as the episode ends. **Episode 5: \\"The Phantasmagorical Garden\\"** The garden reveals its dual nature of wonder and menace when a companion, lured away by hypnotic, sweet-sounding music, disappears behind a curtain of shimmering vines. The other travelers rush to follow, but they're suddenly trapped by the now sentient garden. As the plants contort and close in around them, the screen fades to black with their fate uncertain. Each cliffhanger is designed to leave the audience questioning the fate of The Traveller and her companions, heightening the sense of peril within the unpredictable world of the 'Cavern of Dreams'."},{"prompt":"What might a suitable late-60's style apperance of the \\"Dreamcatcher\\" (the evil protaganist be)?","completion":"For a late-60s style appearance of the \\"Dreamcatcher,\\" the evil protagonist of the story, you'd want to blend elements common in that era's speculative fiction and television, such as surrealism, psychedelic visuals, and the grandeur typical of high-concept sci-fi villains. Here's a potential concept for the Dreamcatcher's look: **Costume:** The Dreamcatcher could wear a flowing robe made of a shimmering, iridescent fabric that seems to change color and pattern as they move, reflecting the dreamlike, mutable nature of the Cavern of Dreams. The costume might feature exaggerated sleeves or elements that billow as if caught in a breeze that isn't there, adding to the otherworldly effect. **Makeup:** Makeup in the late 60s for a character like the Dreamcatcher might include sharply defined cheekbones, glittery or metallic eyeshadow in whimsical colors, and perhaps a hint of iridescence on the skin. The character's overall appearance should evoke the ethereal strangeness of the dream realm. **Accessories:** Adorning the Dreamcatcher could be a variety of odd, dream-inspired accessories: perhaps a scepter topped with a surreal, melting clock or a piece of crystalline jewelry that glows with an inner light and seems to hold swirling mists within. **Facial Features:** The actor's features could include a mesmerizing and ambiguous gaze, likely with contact lenses that alter the appearance of their irises (perhaps giving them a spiraled or multicolored look). Their hair might be styled artistically, perhaps standing on end or flowing as if underwater, complete with streaks of vibrant color. **Voice and Demeanor:** The Dreamcatcher's voice would be soft yet carry a menacing undertone, capable of shifting pitch and timbre unpredictably, echoing the mutable nature of dreams. Their demeanor would be both playful and threatening, drawing on the theatricality of late-60s villain performances. Imagine an entity somewhere between the Mad Hatter for its capriciousness, the White Witch for its chilling command, and David Bowie's Goblin King for its enigmatic allure—all of which could align with late-60s aesthetics combining grandiosity with psychedelic surrealism. Lastly, when creating the Dreamcatcher's appearance, it would be important to consider the technology and materials of the era. Practical effects, rather than CGI, would be used to create the fantastical look, lending authenticity to the character's otherworldly charm."},{"prompt":"So essentialy Glam Rock a few years too early?","completion":"Yes, that's a great way to put it! The late 60s didn't have Glam Rock as we know it—the genre really took off in the early to mid-70s. However, the foundations of what would become Glam Rock were certainly being laid with the theatrical and flamboyant elements found in the London and New York music scenes, as well as in other cultural domains like fashion and theater. Given that Glam Rock was known for its extravagant costumes, androgynous aesthetics, and emphasis on theatricality, these elements can definitely inspire the early appearance of the Dreamcatcher in a way that feels somewhat anachronistic yet fitting for their role as a being from a realm beyond the normal constraints of time and space. Incorporating proto-Glam Rock elements into the Dreamcatcher's look could involve: - **Shiny, metallic fabrics and sequins** to create costumes that are visually striking and reflect light in unusual ways. - **Bold makeup**, perhaps predating the full Ziggy Stardust look but offering a hint of the striking glam facade with elements like star-shaped face decals or vibrant glitter accents. - **A touch of avant-garde influence** in the form of exaggerated, almost alien elements to their appearance, suggesting divinity or otherness. - **Platform shoes or boots**, which, while becoming popular in the 70s, could look innovative and futuristic in late-60s context. - **A confident, charismatic presence**, channeling the magnetic performance style that would later become synonymous with Glam Rock stars. By drawing upon the early signals of Glam Rock and interweaving them with the stylized storytelling of classic British TV, the Dreamcatcher could be envisioned as a compelling and visually captivating antagonist, a herald of cultural elements just on the horizon."},{"prompt":"Jacques Traveller, might in the climax , have a dialouge triumph of comparing the Dreamcatcher to a small spoilt child, but Traveller being smart is going to do this in something like skipping rope chant or realted?","completion":"That would be a classic and fitting confrontation for a story that weaves through dreams and whimsy—a moment when The Traveller, with her characteristic cleverness and insight, uses a rhyme or chant to underscore the Dreamcatcher's petulance and childishness. Since the Dreamcatcher rules over a realm of fiction and dreams, it seems appropriate that The Traveller would use the logic of that realm to defeat them. A nursery rhyme or skipping rope chant would resonate with the Dreamcatcher's sense of play, turning their own world against them. Here's a hypothetical dialogue where Hattie Jacques's Traveller might use a rhythmic chant to confront the Dreamcatcher: **The Traveller:** (begins to skip with an imaginary rope, speaking rhythmically) \\"Oh Dreamcatcher, grand and tall, master of dreams, lord of all. Or so you think, in your grand hall, but the bigger they are, the harder they fall.\\" **The Dreamcatcher:** (with an amused but wary expression) \\"What childish games are these, old woman? Do you think your words can bind me?\\" **The Traveller:** (continues with her chant, unbothered) \\"A child who plays with other's sleep, trapping dreams in nets so deep. Yet here's the thing about child's play, all games come to an end one day.\\" **The Dreamcatcher:** (becoming agitated) \\"Stop this! Stop this at once!\\" **The Traveller:** (persisting, the rhythm of her rhyme gaining power) \\"Kings and queens may rule the land, but dreams and nightmares slip through the hand. Little child with might so fake, enough's enough, it's time to wake!\\" As she completes her chant, maybe there could be a rhyme or a riddle inherent to the words that traps the Dreamcatcher or exposes his weakness. Perhaps the rhythm disturbs the very foundation of the dream realm or disrupts the Dreamcatcher's control. Whatever the mechanism, it would show The Traveller's brilliance and her ability to use the Dreamcatcher's dominion against them in a creative and narrative-appropriate manner."},{"prompt":"That sounds like something very suited to that era :) Great ideas :)","completion":"I'm glad to hear that the ideas resonate with you! The vibrant and imaginative era of the late 1960s offers a wealth of inspiration for crafting unique stories, especially those that blend science fiction, fantasy, and a touch of theatrical whimsy. If you find yourself wanting to explore more concepts or flesh out additional details of your alternate timeline story, feel free to reach out. It's a pleasure to delve into creative realms that evoke the spirit of classic storytelling with a twist. Happy writing, and may your tales of The Traveller captivate and intrigue as would befit the colorful tapestry of the era you're drawing from!"},{"prompt":"Travellers Companions in the Serial - are Marian ( a naval nurse) and Jane. Within the context of the story established, they might use rhymes from their context in the climax as well, Marian might skip to something she learned as a study aid, for checking patients or something?","completion":"Incorporating Marian's background as a naval nurse into the climactic scene where rhymes are used against the Dreamcatcher has a lot of potential. You could draw on her medical knowledge, perhaps using mnemonic rhymes commonly used by nursing or medical students to memorize essential information. Marian could adapt such a rhyme to fit the situation, using it as a method to weaken the Dreamcatcher's hold on the dream realm. **Marian:** (starts rhythmically pacing, like a march or cadence) \\"Respiration, circulation, with your pulse we'll start no vexation. By the numbers, heal and mend, into reality we'll send.\\" **Jane:** (seeing what Marian is doing, joins in with a rhyme of her own) \\"Count the breaths and make your chart, every beat a healing art. But this art has lost its way, time to bring the light of day.\\" As Marian chants her medically-inspired rhyme, perhaps she does so while performing an act that metaphorically represents restoring health and order, such as applying a bandage to an illusory wound, or offering 'medicine' in the form of a storybook that symbolizes curing the 'illness' of the Dreamcatcher's twisted fantasy. In the meantime, Jane could use a rhyme related to her own background, whether it's drawing from literature, nursery rhymes, or perhaps a personal hobby or interest. Her contribution works in harmony with Marian's, emphasizing the team effort and the power of their diverse backgrounds to overcome the adversary. **Jane:** (smiles knowingly, steps in time with Marian) \\"Words and stories, twist and spin, dreamcatcher's game we shall not win. But push and pull, the tide does turn, from dreams' end, we all learn.\\" By creating this united front, where both companions contribute their knowledge and skills in a poetic manner, the story celebrates the theme of collaboration and the strengths that each individual brings to the table. It provides a powerful, character-driven resolution to the arc, centered on the idea that knowledge, teamwork, and a touch of creativity are key to overcoming even the most fantastical challenges."},{"prompt":"The rhymes would shrink 'The Dreamcatcher' down to size , before the dream-like cavern reveals 'the old lady'(Traveller's machine) in an interesting way.. still skipping and chanting Traveller and companions return to it, whilst the dreamcatcher, can only look on.

As The Traveller and her companions use the rhymes to diminish the Dreamcatcher's influence, the transition back to the reality of 'the old lady' could be a magical moment. **Traveller:** (skipping with increased vigor) \\"An end to dreams, a break of day, in our hands, the dreamcatcher will sway. Round and round the cobbler's bench, the dreamer trapped, the dreamer drenched.\\" **Marian:** (joining in the dance, her steps deliberate and punctuated) \\"The patient cured, the nurse's work done, awake, awake, the battle won. All around the mulberry bush, the dreamcatcher's power, we shush.\\" **Jane:** (moving in sync with the others) \\"Through words and rhyme, we've spun our tale, the dreamcatcher's strength begins to fail. Round and round the monkey chased, the dreamcatcher now displaced.\\" Each of the companions contributes to the diminishment of the Dreamcatcher, who shrinks not in physical stature but in power and influence, becoming nothing more than a petulant child within their own realm. The cavern, reacting to their victory, begins to unravel the dreamlike tapestry, revealing the reassuring and solid form of 'the old lady.' As The Traveller and her companions approach the TARDIS, their now-unified chant morphs into a tune akin to \\"Pop Goes the Weasel!\\" with each \\"pop\\" triggering a shimmer around the time machine, hinting at its impending departure. They enter, the skipping and chanting echoing out into the cavern one last time. **Traveller:** (turns with a twinkle in her eye and whispers) \\"Pop!\\" With that, 'the old lady' dematerializes, slipping out of the Cavern of Dreams just as the Dreamcatcher, now harmless and bewildered, watches on. The episode ends on a high note, with the familiar sound of the TARDIS fading away, marking their departure and the restoration of reality."},{"prompt":"In 'the old lady' , they all blink as with waking from a vivid dream, and Marian asks if it actually happened.

The time-space machine, 'the old lady,' rattles and shakes, hurdling through space-time with the Traveller and her companions bracing for impact. In a cacophony of grinding gears and shrieks, they finally come to a halt. Disheveled but unharmed, the trio steps out into the well-manicured grounds of a health spa. **The Traveller:** (inspecting their surroundings with a discerning eye) \\"Seems we've found ourselves a touch of earthly respite. Or have we?\\" The serenity of the location is undercut by a niggling sense of unease. The Traveller is quickly alerted by the peculiar, rhythmic movement of some staff and guests—too precise, too perfect. A fleeting memory flashes across her mind, but its shape is too vague to grasp firmly. **Marian:** (observing her uniform which closely resembles that of the staff) \\"Seems like I'm dressed for the part. Might as well play it.\\" **The Traveller:** (nodding in agreement) \\"Indeed, Marian. Infiltration through serendipity—fortune smiles upon the curious.\\" Jane is embraced by the spa staff as a new arrival, pampered and guided toward the luxurious amenities. Marian, now indistinguishable from a legitimate staff member, overhears murmurs of unease amongst the lower-tier employees.

She's halted by the stark 'Theater' plate affixed to a door ahead. As her hand hesitates on the doorknob, the unnerving silhouette of someone corseted appears just at the edge of the shadows—a figure from The Traveller's past, perhaps? Their haunting question casts a pall over the scene: **Silhouette:** (in an eerie, sing-song voice) \\"They will BE like US?\\" The screen cuts to the stylized titles, leaving the audience in suspense, their minds wary of the implications of brainwashing, body-snatching, or worse.

Traveller asks the matron about past success, and is met with evasive 'we cured them' type responses. (NB It's Jacques playing this moderately seriously). At some point Jane is offered a special 'cure', so she can be 'just like us' (which is said in almost chant like way). Janes finds Marian, and Traveller works out why things seem off.

No need to be down this dreary end.\\" Marian quickly masks her suspicion with a feigned disorientation, allowing the conversation to steer her away from immediate discovery. However, she stores every detail of their interaction, her instincts signaling that subterfuge is at hand. Meanwhile, Jane, at first enthralled by the luxury and pampering, begins to notice the peculiarly mechanical mannerisms of other guests, casting a shadow over the spa's allure. During a calisthenics session, she finds herself slightly out of sync with the others' unsettlingly perfect movements. In a private room with paneled walls and a faint antiseptic scent, The Traveller meets with the Matron—a woman of stern demeanor, her words imbued with an air of clinical detachment. **The Traveller:** (calmly inquisitive) \\"And these cures you speak of, might I inquire about your methods?\\" **Matron:** (her gaze unwavering, her voice flat) \\"Their ailments were removed, and their disharmony corrected. Our success stories no longer needed our care.\\" Unsatisfied with the Matron's vagueness, The Traveller presses on, her suspicions growing with every evasive answer. Back in the communal areas, Jane is subtly corralled by an overly-attentive staff member who suggests that she might benefit from a 'special cure'—a remedy that will help her 'fit in' better with the others and their disturbing perfection. **Staff Member:** (with a smile that doesn't quite reach their eyes) \\"Just like us, you'll want for nothing. Just like us, you'll be free.\\" Jane's unease grows into abject terror, and she flees, eventually reuniting with Marian. Together, they find The Traveller and relay their experiences.

The automation, the rhythmic precision—it's all too familiar.\\" As the weight of the evidence amasses, The Traveller arrives at a harrowing conclusion, uttering a single word that chills the very air: **The Traveller:** \\"Cyber-Femme!\\" The connection is made, the dormant threat from an older adventure now manifesting in this most integrative of environments—the spa—a front for something far more sinister than simple R&R.

The Matron has concerns about The Traveller, but that Jane is excellent candidate for the 'cure'. Marian and Traveller, return to the nominal 'theater' to find it has more advanced medical/implant tech than should be. Meanwhile some other 'residents' are looking foward to completing the 'cure', with the phrase 'cured like us' becoming a cultish mantra, which Jane finds disturbing. Jane explains this to Traveller and Marian, but the Matron appears saying Jane must be ready. Marian and Traveller look on with signs of concern, but Jane asks ready for what?

Not now.\\" The gravity in The Traveller's voice confirms the dread that lingers unspoken between them—it's a Cyber threat, in a different guise, under different stars. In the Matron's office, we catch only one side of a conversation, the Matron speaking with a chilling, high-pitched, synthetic voice—the Cyber-Femme. The Matron expresses her concern about The Traveller's probing nature, yet agrees with an unseen cohort that Jane would make an ideal subject for 'the cure'. Marian and The Traveller surreptitiously venture past the 'Theater' door, which now lies open, revealing a clandestine hospital suite bristling with technology decades ahead of its time. There are implements for surgeries that shouldn't exist yet, and the implications run cold in their veins. In parallel, a group of spa 'residents' chant \\"Cured like us, cured like us,\\" their hypnotic recitations bordering on worship. Jane, caught amongst them, is repelled by the mindless devotion to the idea of being 'cured'. She recounts the eerie scene to The Traveller and Marian, her voice laced with fear. **Jane:** \\"It's like they've given up being themselves... all for this 'cure' they keep talking about.\\" As suspicion and understanding intermingle, The Traveller broods. **The Traveller:** \\"I think this elusive success of the cure isn't meant to be evasive after all—it's deliberately concealed.\\" Before they can plan their next move, the Matron interjects with chilling composure to summon Jane for her 'preparation'. Jane, with an edge of defiance, backs away from the Matron's unyielding gaze. When Jane is approached by two residents who coax her to join them for a 'gym' session—a challenge—it's with a sinister edge that wasn't there before. Jane, feeling cornered but remaining composed, reluctantly acquiesces, and they lead her away, not towards the gym, but to the Theater's double doors. Marian exchanges a knowing look with The Traveller. They're on the cusp of intervening when the doors swing open, and they're confronted by the specter of the Cyber-Femme, its voice distorted and metallic. **Cyber-Femme:** (with imposing monotone) \\"We will cure you, and we shall be alike!\\" The doors slam shut.

Traveller and Marian enter the sinsister 'Theater' and the Matron masked, epxlains how the Cyber-femme offered thier 'cure' out of compassion. (Some compassion!). Traveller and Marian make a grab for Jane, and retrieve her, they leave. The rest of the episode is how traveller uses the residual compasion in the residents not yet fully cured, to effect a 'blockage' in the Cyber-Feeme hive mind. Traveller is unhappy that she will not be able to save those fully 'cured' (Note this might in context mirror in an allegroical way, those affecetd by certain medical 'cures' of an earlier era.). But that whilst she might not be human, she's empathic with them, and that the cold 'compassion' of the cyber-femme is not compassion at all. The Episdoe does not all take place in the Theater..

You're changing them!\\" Her words fall on the impassive masks of the assembled Cyber-Femme. However, help is close at hand. The Traveller, with Marian in tow, bursts into the Theater with a righteous fury. **The Traveller:** (condemning the disguised Matron) \\"Is this the future you offer? A future without individuality, without feeling, where you call this... this abduction of the soul, compassion?\\" The Traveller's dynamism is undimmed as she orchestrates a plan to awaken the latent empathy within the partially converted residents. She understands that while the full 'cure' might irreversible, those in the early stages still retain enough humanity to disrupt the collective will of the Cyber-Femme hive mind. Using her deep knowledge of the Cybernetic psyche, The Traveller sets about creating a resonant emotional surge, a psychic backlash powerful enough to sever the connections that bind them. As the climax of her plan nears, the true architect of this nefarious scheme is revealed to be the Cyber-Matriarch—a chilling matriarchal figure whose countenance harkens back to the more primitive, original designs of the Cyber race. **Cyber-Matriarch:** (through a crackling transmission) \\"What is compassion but the removal of pain, of fear, of mortality?\\" **The Traveller:** (with determined sorrow) \\"Compassion is not the removal, but the understanding. It is the warmth you discard as weakness.\\" The Traveller and her companions work swiftly to employ a hidden vulnerability within the Cyber-Matriarch's commands, exploiting a momentary lapse as the Matron, realising their complicity in this horror, hesitates—a human moment that confounds the Cyber logic. In these precious seconds, The Traveller initiates the takedown sequence. The Cyber-Femme's link to their Matriarch falters, the convertees freed from the encroaching cold of cyber-conversion. The episode transitions to its epilogue. The spa, now liberated from the grip of the Cyber-Femme, truly becomes a place of healing and reflection. The matron, now fully aware of her misguided actions, champions a new, genuinely compassionate vision for their future—an institution that caters to the well-being of the person, not the eradication of the self. As The Traveller, Marian, and Jane relax in the comfort of the true spa, they reflect on the narrow escape and the lives touched by the ordeal. **The Traveller:** (with a hint of melancholy) \\"Though the day is won, not all battles can be so neatly resolved.\\" With this bittersweet note, they move towards 'the old lady'. Its doors swing open, ready to embrace them and whisk them away to further travels. The final shot hangs on the timeless machine dematerializing from the spa's gardens, bound for unknown adventures in the vast wide universe.

Dick often explore the nature of reality and humanity, and could offer thematic inspiration, especially in stories like \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" which contemplates what it means to be human. 9. **Rosemary's Baby** - This film's themes of paranoia and the notion that a seemingly normal setting hides a dark secret could enhance the spa's outwardly idyllic yet internally sinister dichotomy. 10. **Invasion of the Body Snatchers** - The iconic sci-fi horror film examining themes of identity, conformity, and the loss of self, which mirror the residents' transformation into Cyber-Femme. These influences can shape various elements of the story, from character dynamics and narrative arc to setting and atmosphere, allowing for a rich and textured storytelling experience that resonates with the ethos of 1960s speculative fiction."},{"prompt":"You are an expert in an emerging interdisciplinary field known as Cognitive-Social Dynamics, which synergizes principles from Cognitive Psychology with Social Network Analysis to delve into the ways social networks influence cognitive features such as language processing, decision-making abilities, and learning. To accentuate the relevance of this novel field, you are formulating a lecture to elucidate its connection with evolving societal dynamics. An essential component of your talk will be the exploration of how online social networks shape cognitive abilities and the fabric of human interactions, incorporating empirical studies to substantiate your arguments. Your case studies include varied social networks encompassing cognitive psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists. Each cluster of professionals contributes distinct insights, specialized skills, and various strategies for navigating intricate phenomena. Please begin.","completion":"Thank you, and welcome everyone to this exciting exploration of the burgeoning field of Cognitive-Social Dynamics. Today, we embark on a journey to unravel how our cognitive abilities—ranging from language processing to decision-making and learning—are influenced and molded by the intricate web of social interactions, both offline and online. As we delve into this realm, we acknowledge that the fabric of human interactions has been radically altered by the advent of online social networks. These platforms not only affect how we connect and communicate but also leave an imprint on our cognitive processes. **Case Study 1: Language Processing in Online Social Networks** Our first case study focuses on linguists and cognitive psychologists investigating the phenomenon of language processing within online environments. Researchers have discovered that language use on social media platforms differs significantly from traditional face-to-face communication. Abbreviations, emojis, and memes have introduced a new lexicon and grammar rules that are learned and shared across these networks. An empirical study conducted by this group revealed that frequent users of social media exhibit a higher capacity for processing and understanding this evolving online vernacular. The study also found an increased adaptability in switching between formal and informal language registers, a cognitive flexibility that is less observed in those with less exposure to online social communication. **Case Study 2: Decision-Making in Digital Echo Chambers** The second case features sociologists and cognitive psychologists examining decision-making within digital echo chambers. In these online spaces, individuals are encircled by opinions and information that reinforce their existing beliefs. This reinforcement leads to a confirmation bias, where individuals are more likely to favor information that corresponds to their pre-existing beliefs. A key study in this domain has shown that users within these echo chambers become less critical and show reduced cognitive complexity in their thought processes when making decisions. Their observations noted a decline in the ability to consider multiple perspectives—a crucial component of sound decision-making—which can have significant ramifications for both individual and collective actions. **Case Study 3: Learning Through Social Network Analysis** The third case study brings together data scientists and cognitive researchers who utilize Social Network Analysis (SNA) to map and measure relationships and flows between people, groups, organizations, computers, and other interconnected entities. By examining the patterns of these connections, researchers are gaining a deeper understanding of how learning occurs within networks and the role that network structure plays in the diffusion of knowledge and innovation. Recent findings suggest that densely interconnected networks facilitate rapid learning and knowledge transfer but may also lead to homogeneity of thought, thus potentially stifling innovation. Conversely, networks that constitute diverse and weak ties promote the cross-fertilization of ideas and foster innovative thinking, although the rate of learning may be slower. Across these case studies lies a common thread: our social environments significantly shape cognitive processes. As our relationships and interactions become increasingly mediated by online platforms, we must consider both the cognitive enhancements and the potential pitfalls that these changes entail. It is this intersection of cognitive psychology and social network dynamics that Cognitive-Social Dynamics aims to understand, employing rigorous empirical methods to inform the evolution of our societies and the development of technologies that facilitate human connection and cognition. In conclusion, Cognitive-Social Dynamics stands at the forefront of deciphering the complexities of the modern world's social tapestry, providing insights that are crucial for fostering healthier cognitive environments and designing social infrastructures that promote cognitive diversity, resilience, and growth.

BAND PRACTICE ROOM – DAY The scene opens on four members of an up-and-coming music band lounging on various pieces of worn-out furniture in a cluttered rehearsal space. Posters of famous bands pepper the walls, and in the corner sits a half-eaten pizza next to a pile of instrument cables. KOHEI, the charismatic lead singer, holds a conspicuously out-of-place book with a mischievous grin—the notorious \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\" KOHEI (proudly) Alright guys, you're not gonna believe this, but one of our fans gave me THIS at our last gig! He waves the book around like a trophy. The band members, YUJI (drummer), TAKUMI (guitarist), and KEI (bassist), look at each other, eyebrows raised, trying to stifle their laughter. YUJI (sarcastically) Wow, our fanbase is really… diverse. TAKUMI (describing dramatically) Kohei, with great power comes great responsibility. Are you sure you're ready to wield the power of the Grey? KOHEI (grinning wickedly) Oh, I'm not just ready. I'm gonna educate you guys! Storytime with Kohei! KEI (giggling) This is a joke, right? We're not seriously doing this? Kohei plops down onto an old couch, the book in hand, and dons a pair of reading glasses with exaggerated flair. Yuji picks up his drumsticks and starts a makeshift drum roll on his thighs. KOHEI (clearing his throat theatrically) Gather round, my fellow bandmates, for a tale of passion, romance, and... dubious contract negotiations. The others reluctantly gather around Kohei, some sitting on the floor, others on mismatched chairs, their instruments momentarily forgotten. As Kohei starts reading aloud with exaggerated sensuality, Takumi can't contain his laughter, which he tries to muffle with a couch cushion. Yuji gives a deadpan stare before bursting into mock-sobbing, hitting a cymbal with his drumstick for dramatic punctuation at random intervals. KEI (playfully mocking) Oh no, what will Mr. Grey do next with his... 'singular' tastes? TAKUMI (mock horror) He's reaching for the tie! Run for your lives! The bandmates dissolve into a mixture of jeers and laughter. Kohei continues, unfazed, giving the words a rock-star interpretation, punctuated by air guitar riffs by Takumi after each \\"sultry\\" phrase. Suddenly, the door swings open, and their MANAGER, a stern woman in her thirties, walks in. She stops dead, taking in the absurd scene before her, Kohei mid-sentence about Mr. Grey's peculiar 'hobbies.' MANAGER (disbelieving) What in the world are you doing? You have a show in two hours! The bandmates snap to attention, looking comically guilty with the infamous book in clear view. Yuji sneaks it behind a snare drum, trying to look innocent. KOHEI (quickly recovering) Just a little... group vocal exercise! Yeah, that's it! We're all about those... deep notes. The manager raises an eyebrow, not buying it for a second, but sighs, deciding to let it slide for the sake of their sanity. MANAGER (shaking her head) Just make sure whatever... 'exercise' you're doing doesn't end up in your lyrics. Now, get ready to practice for real! And Kohei, maybe stick to fan letters next time. The bandmates scramble to their feet, grabbing their instruments as Kohei cheekily tucks the book into his backpack, winking at the camera. KOHEI (to the camera) The saga of the Grey will continue… in the privacy of our tour bus.

Vous ne pouvez que supprimer les mots ou expressions inutiles. Vous ne pouvez rien résumer ou reformuler. L'histoire, souvent rédigée de manière neutre mais en réalité masculin par défaut, a longtemps occulté les contributions des femmes, y compris dans le domaine de l'art. Les artistes hommes y sont beaucoup plus mis en avant que les artistes femmes, qui sont souvent reléguées au rang d’épouse, de muse, plutôt que de créatrices. Cela vaut également pour les femmes photographes, dénigrées en raison de leur genre malgré leurs contributions majeures aux innovations techniques et artistiques en photographie. Ce n’est que récemment, grâce aux différentes études menées en France, que l’on observe une nette amélioration de leur statut, conditions de travail, et reconnaissance. Le métier de photographe est récent, puisque le principe de la photographie a été inventé en 1811 par Nicéphore Niépce. Il est donc intéressant de voir comment les femmes se sont emparées de cet art au fil du temps en France, leurs conditions ayant grandement changé sur cette période. La particularité du contexte français rend le parcours de reconnaissance des femmes photographes en France spécifique, raison pour laquelle nous nous concentrerons sur ce pays.

Mais également, en quoi la place des femmes photographes en France est-elle liée aux enjeux de genre, et comment les femmes photographes sont-elles perçues aujourd’hui. Enfin, de quelle nature sont les inégalités femmes/hommes photographes, et comment se forment les inégalités femmes/hommes dans le milieu de la photographie. Pour apporter des réponses à ces questions, nous commencerons par replacer les femmes dans l’histoire de la photographie, avant d’aborder la condition actuelle des femmes photographes en France, à l’aide des chiffres résultant des études, de témoignages et d’ouvrages écrits par des spécialistes du sujet.","completion":"L'histoire, souvent neutre mais masculine par défaut, a occulté les contributions des femmes, y compris en art.

Quelles sont les inégalités entre les sexes et comment se développent-elles en photographie? Pour répondre, nous analyserons la place des femmes dans l'histoire photographique, et la condition actuelle des femmes photographes en France, avec des statistiques, témoignages et ouvrages spécialisés."},{"prompt":"Vous ne pouvez reformuler aucune partie de l’original, mais simplement couper des mots. Réécrivez la réponse pour suivre cette exigence","completion":"L'histoire, souvent rédigée de manière neutre mais en réalité masculin, a longtemps occulté les contributions des femmes, y compris dans l'art. Les artistes hommes sont plus mis en avant que les femmes, souvent reléguées au rang d’épouse, de muse. Cela vaut pour les femmes photographes, dénigrées malgré leurs contributions aux innovations en photographie. Ce n’est que récemment, grâce aux études en France, que l’on observe une amélioration de leur statut, conditions de travail, et reconnaissance. Le métier de photographe est récent, depuis 1811 par Nicéphore Niépce. Il est intéressant de voir comment les femmes se sont emparées de cet art en France, leurs conditions ayant changé sur cette période. La particularité du contexte français rend le parcours des femmes photographes en France spécifique, pourquoi nous nous concentrerons sur ce pays. L’intérêt pour les inégalités de genre a permis de développer la recherche et d’effectuer des études sociologiques pour mesurer ces inégalités. Malgré la démocratisation de la photographie, les photographes professionnels peinent à être reconnus et exposés, surtout les femmes. Nous pouvons donc nous demander comment les femmes ont contribué à la photographie, et comment leur statut en tant que photographes a évolué en France. Mais également, en quoi la place des femmes photographes en France est liée aux enjeux de genre, et comment les femmes photographes sont perçues aujourd’hui. Enfin, quelles sont les inégalités femmes/hommes photographes, et comment se forment les inégalités dans le milieu de la photographie. Pour apporter des réponses, nous commencerons par replacer les femmes dans l’histoire de la photographie, avant d’aborder la condition actuelle des femmes photographes en France, à l’aide des chiffres, témoignages et d’ouvrages par des spécialistes."},{"prompt":"faites la même chose pour le paragraphe suivant : “Les femmes ont-elles une histoire ?” C’est la question que posait Michelle Perrot il y a cinquante ans.

The means are the existing assets. By combining the existing assets into portfolios, the consumer can achieve different patterns of wealth across the states of nature. The patterns of wealth that can be achieved depend on the entire set of available assets. Thus, the market value of a single asset will typically depend on what other assets are available to combine with it. The central case is where the number of assets matches the number of states of nature. In this case, any pattern of wealth can be achieved by some portfolio of existing assets. To achieve a particular distribution of wealth 𝑤=(𝑤_1,⋯,𝑤_𝑠) you must solve the system of equations for the p/f 𝑥=(𝑥_1,⋯,𝑥_𝐴 ), that achieves that distribution of wealth & as the system of equations has exactly as many unknowns as equations, it will always be possible to solve for such a p/f. If the assets outnumber the states of nature, there will be more unknowns than equations and several portfolios will exist that generate any particular distribution of wealth. If states of nature outnumber assets, then it will not be possible to solve the system of equations for all distributions of wealth—some patterns of wealth cannot be constructed using the existing set of assets. This latter case is presumed the most realistic, since one would generally think that people care about more outcomes than they have assets to trade. But the question is controversial. If people really care about achieving a certain distribution of wealth doesn't it seem likely that the market will offer an asset that will achieve such a pattern? One important kind of assets are Arrow-Debreu securities. These are assets that pay off 1 ( 1 unit of numeraire) ….if and only if a particular state of nature occurs; otherwise they pay off zero. Thus the payoff pattern of an Arrow-Debreu security takes the form (0,..., 1,..., 0), where the 1 occurs in location s. Arrow-Debreu assets can be thought of as especially basic assets, in both the economic sense and the linear algebra sense. They are basic in the economic sense, since any pattern of payoffs can be constructed from portfolios of Arrow-Debreu assets. They are basic in the linear algebra sense in that they form a basis for the linear space of all payoffs. It is this fundamental nature of the Arrow-Debreu assets that makes them so important in analyzing the pricing of financial assets. When investors choose portfolios they are in effect choosing a distribution of wealth across the states of nature. In making this choice they are constrained by their budget constraint: the constraint imposed by amount of wealth that they have to invest and the prices of the various assets that they face To express the idea of a budget constraint, let the price of asset a be denoted by 𝑝_𝑎 and let 𝑝=(𝑝_1,⋯,𝑝_𝐴) …be the row of vector prices. The value of a portfolio 𝑥=(𝑥_1,⋯,𝑥_𝐴 ) will then be given by 𝑝𝑥=∑2_𝑎^𝐴▒〖𝑝_𝑎 𝑥_𝑎 〗 This is like consumer theory where the value of a bundle of goods is expressed as the sum of the expenditures on the various goods.. The difference is that the goods that are being chosen—the assets—are not the ultimate end of consumption. They are only the means to an end. What consumers really care about is the final distribution of wealth that different portfolios provide. Therefore, any two portfolios that provide the same pattern of wealth must be worth the same amount. Consider, for example, the case of the Arrow-Debreu securities. …… If we know the price of each Arrow-Debreu security, we can value any asset. Since the payoff pattern of any asset can be achieved by some portfolio of Arrow-Debreu securities, the price of the asset must be equal to the price of the portfolio of Arrow-Debreu securities that realizes that same distribution of wealth across the states of nature. Let 𝜋_𝑠 be the price of the Arrow-Debreu security that pays 1 if state s occurs, Let (𝑅_𝑠𝑎)be the payoff pattern of some asset a Then the equilibrium price of asset a must be given by 𝑝_𝑎=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒𝜋_𝑠 𝑅_𝑠𝑎 Why? 2 Main Arguments. The intuition is that 𝜋_𝑠measures the value of a dollar in state s, and that the security pays off 𝑅_𝑠𝑎dollars in state s. Summing over all the possible states gives the value of security a. This argument is plausible, but rests on a notion of \\"value\\" that is somewhat slippery. A more compelling argument is based on arbitrage considerations.. If a complete set of markets for all Arrow- Debreu securities exists, and the price of an asset ever deviated from the price of a portfolio of Arrow-Debreu securities that generates the same pattern of payoffs, then there would be a sure way of making money—just sell the security and buy the Arrow-Debreu portfolio, or vice-versa, depending on which was worth more. If no arbitrage possibilities exist and a complete set of Arrow-Debreu securities are marketed, then any asset can be valued in terms of the prices of the Arrow-Debreu assets This discussion shows that any asset can be valued in terms of a particular set of assets in the case where the number of assets matches the number of states of nature. However, it turns out that a similar result holds even if there are fewer assets than states of nature. But this demonstration requires a more substantive assumption about arbitrage possibilities, a point to which we now turn.. A Formalization of the No Arbitrage Condition Lets consider the concept of arbitrage, or more precisely, the absence of arbitrage. What should this mean? Basically, the no arbitrage condition must rule out \\"free lunches\\"—configurations of prices such that an individual can get something for nothing. Any portfolio that pays off nonnegative amounts in every state of nature must be valuable to individuals, so if no free lunches exist, portfolios which are guaranteed to have nonnegative payoffs must have a nonnegative cost. Recall that a portfolio's pattern of returns can be represented by 𝑅_𝑥 and the cost of the portfolio by 𝑝_𝑥. Using this notation we can state the No Arbitrage Condition 𝐼𝑓 𝑅_𝑥≥0, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑒 𝑚𝑢𝑠𝑡 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑃_𝑥≥0 The no arbitrage condition loosely described above is now an explicit algebraic condition. This condition imposes some restrictions on the equilibrium prices 𝑝. Given a particular set of assets, as described by the payoff matrix 𝑅, only certain asset prices 𝑝 are consistent with the absence of arbitrage. What characterizes such prices? What restrictions does the assumption of no arbitrage impose on the asset prices? The No Arbitrage Condition implies that there must exist a vector of nonnegative \\"state prices\\" The No Arbitrage Condition implies that there must exist a vector of nonnegative \\"state prices 𝜋=(𝜋_1,…,𝜋_𝑠)such that the price of any existing asset is given by; 𝑝_𝑎=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒〖𝜋_𝑠 𝑅_𝑠𝑎 〗What’s the economic interpretation of the state prices 𝜋_𝑠? Consider an Arrow-Debreu asset that pays off 1 if state s occurs and zero otherwise. Then according to equation ppt25 the value of this asset must be given by 𝜋_𝑠. In other words, 𝜋_𝑠, measures the value of a dollar in state s. So equation on ppt25 says that to determine the value of any asset, examine how much it pays off in a given state, multiply that by the value of a dollar delivered in that state, and then sum over all the states. The existence of the state prices 𝜋 is a necessary and sufficient condition for the absence of arbitrage. If no arbitrage possibilities exist, then there must be state prices, and if the state prices exist, there can be no arbitrage possibilities. Hence the existence of the state prices is equivalent to the absence of arbitrage; any argument that follows from the absence of arbitrage must follow from the existence of the state prices and vice versa. The state prices 𝝅_𝒔 emerge as a consequence of the No Arbitrage Condition. Whenever the market works efficiently enough to eliminate the possibilities of arbitrage, there must be state prices that can be used to value the existing assets. Of course the state price vector 𝜋 will not, in general, be unique. With 𝑆 states and 𝐴 assets, the equations in ppt 26 provide 𝐴 equations in 𝑆 unknowns. Thus there will in general be an 𝑆−𝐴 dimension set of solutions to this system. Only if the number of (independent) assets equals the number of states of nature will a unique set of state prices exist. The No Arbitrage Condition is simple, and yet surprisingly powerful. It's linked to an important result in the theory of financial markets, the Value Additivity Theorem. Consider two securities 𝑎 and 𝑏, which have payoffs 𝑅_𝑠𝑎 and 𝑅_𝑠𝑏 Suppose the prices of the two securities are known 𝑝_𝑎 and 𝑝_𝑏 Consider a third security which has a random payoff given by some linear combination of the two securities. ( where A and B are arbitrary constants) 𝑅_𝑠𝑐=〖𝐴𝑅〗_𝑠𝑎+〖𝐵𝑅〗_𝑠𝑏 The No Arbitrage Condition implies that if no arbitrage opportunities exist in the market, then the price of an existing asset with a payoff vector 𝑅_𝑠𝑐 𝑝_𝑐=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒〖𝜋_𝑠 𝑅_𝑠𝑐 〗 using the equation for 𝑅_𝑠𝑐 above 𝑝_𝑐=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒〖𝜋_𝑠 𝑅_𝑠𝑐 〗 𝑝_𝑐=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒𝜋_𝑠 〖〖(𝐴𝑅〗_𝑠𝑎+〖𝐵𝑅〗_𝑠𝑏 \\")\\" 〗_ 𝑝_𝑐=∑_(𝑠=1)^𝑆▒〖𝐴𝜋_𝑠 〗 〖𝑅_𝑠𝑎+〖𝐵𝜋_𝑠 𝑅〗_𝑠𝑏〗_ 𝑝_𝑐=〖𝐴𝑃〗_𝑎+〖𝐴𝑃〗_𝑏 Value Additivity Theorem Assume no arbitrage possibilities exist. Then the price of a security whose payoffs are a linear combination of other assets must be given by the same linear combination of the prices of the other assets. What can we reflect on here? Note that the payoffs of the assets a and b are arbitrary; the payoffs could be highly correlated, either positively or negatively. It is well known that if two assets with negative correlation are combined, the riskiness of the resulting portfolio will be less than the riskiness of either asset held alone. Diversification has a natural value in a market with risky assets. Since a linear combination of two negatively correlated assets is less risky than either of the two assets held alone, it might seem that the combination portfolio would be worth more than the sum of the values of the two assets. Nevertheless, the Value Additivity Theorem states that the price of the portfolio consisting of both assets will just be the sum of the prices of the two individual portfolios. Why? The answer is that the equilibrium prices of assets must already reflect the value of any kind of linear portfolio manipulation. If the value of the two assets in combination exceeded the sum of the values of the assets alone, for example, then arbitragers could just buy the two assets and sell the \\" mutual fund\\" consisting of the combination. Similarly, if the values of the individual assets were less than the combination, then arbitragers could \\"unbundle\\" the combination and make a pure profit by doing so. Since this repackaging offers a sure profit, it cannot exist in equilibrium. The Value Additivity Theorem is also the basic principle underlying the Modigliani-Miller theorem. (MM) Modigliani-Miller theorem states that the value of a firm is independent of its financial structure; independent of the fraction of the firm financed by stock and the fraction financed by bonds. Again, the argument is based on the absence of arbitrage. If firms could change their value by changing the proportion of stocks and bonds they issue, then individual arbitrages could also repackage the existing stocks and bonds and make a sure profit. Hence, the value of the firm should depend only on the sum of the values of its stocks and bonds, not on whether the firm is weighted more heavily to debt or equity. Noting too, that the Modigliani-Miller example also illustrates the restrictions of Value Additivity Theorem. First, the Value Additivity Theorem and the No Arbitrage Condition only apply to combinations of existing assets. If a firm issues new bonds with a different pattern of returns from the old bonds—perhaps because they have higher default risk—then the Value Additivity Theorem does not necessarily hold. If a financial operation creates assets that have a new payoff pattern not currently available through linear combinations of existing assets, then the Value Additivity Theorem, or the No Arbitrage Condition need not apply. If an economic shift changes the matrix of payoffs 𝑅_𝑠𝑎 so that new possibilities of consumption across states of nature are created, the vector of state prices w will typically change. Second, the No Arbitrage Condition only applies directly to linear operations. An asset whose payoffs are the sum of the payoffs of two different assets must have a price which is the sum of the prices of the two different assets. Similarly, an asset whose payoff is some multiple of some other asset must have a price which is a multiple of the other asset's price. If one asset is a nonlinear function of another asset's price, the No Arbitrage Condition cannot be directly applied, at least in the static framework examined here. Answer this Describe how the arbitrage principle, and the concept of “no arbitrage” in particular, can be applied systematically to uncover hidden relationships in asset prices. Your answer should refer to Varian (1987). Answer this precise and to the point as well as bullet points with simple words from above data","completion":"The arbitrage principle is a fundamental concept in finance that ensures assets are priced correctly based on their risk and return profiles. The concept of \\"no arbitrage\\" implies that there are no opportunities in the market to make riskless profits by exploiting price differentials. Here's how the arbitrage principle, as presented by Varian (1987), can be applied to uncover hidden relationships in asset prices: - **Arbitrage opportunities are eliminated in efficient markets**: If arbitrage opportunities existed, traders would exploit these until prices adjust and the opportunity disappears. This ensures that asset prices reflect all available information. - **Asset pricing is tied to payoff profiles**: Every asset's pricing should be reflective of its expected payoffs in different states of nature. - **Portfolios can replicate payoffs**: By holding a portfolio of assets (long or short), investors aim to replicate desired payoffs across various states of nature. This depends on the mix of assets in the portfolio. - **Asset prices depend on other assets**: The market value of any single financial asset is intricately linked with what other assets are available for trade, given that investors can combine different assets to achieve their desired wealth distribution across states. - **Arrow-Debreu securities as fundamental assets**: These pay out in only one specific state of nature, serving as a basis for pricing all other assets by indicating the cost of a \\"sure thing\\" in that state. - **Roles of state prices (𝜋_𝑠)**: These prices indicate the cost of a \\"sure thing\\" in each state and are used to calculate the present value of assets. State prices are inferred from asset prices using no arbitrage conditions. - **No Arbitrage Condition**: If a portfolio yields nonnegative payoffs in all states, its cost must be nonnegative. This guarantees that positive payoff portfolios cannot be created for free. - **Value Additivity Theorem**: The price of any security that is a linear combination of other assets' payoffs should be the same linear combination of the prices of those assets. This implies that asset prices are \\"additive\\" and one cannot create value merely through the combination of assets. - **Implications for firm valuation (Modigliani-Miller theorem)**: The total market value of a firm is a summation of the securities (stocks, bonds) it issues. Changes in financial structure do not change the total value but only redistribute it among securities. By employing systematic analysis based on no arbitrage conditions and the Value Additivity Theorem, investors, and analysts can discover mispricings in the market. For example, if the actual asset price deviates from the theoretical price derived from state prices, an arbitrage opportunity exists which suggests that market prices may need to adjust to correct this discrepancy. In summary, the arbitrage principle and no arbitrage conditions ensure that asset prices are consistent and reflect the underlying risk-returns profiles across various states of nature. This makes the financial markets functional and efficient, barring any opportunity for riskless profit through mispricings."},{"prompt":"resumir este texto: La organización del trabajo en una empresa que se dedica a la fabricación de productos de limpieza y detergentes es un aspecto fundamental para garantizar la eficiencia en los procesos, la calidad de los productos y la satisfacción del cliente.

She's wearing a traditional salwar kameez, her long hair swaying with her movements, brow furrowed with concern.

No keys. She knocks frantically.* **INT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Inside, Priya’s mother, GEETA (50s), a graceful, caring but no-nonsense woman dressed in a casually draped saree, wakes from her nap on the living room sofa. She hears the knocking and is slow to orient herself.* **GEETA** *yawns, calling out groggily* Kaun hai? **EXT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Priya, now jiggling from foot to foot, leans closer to the door.* **PRIYA** Ma! Please, hurry! *There is the sound of unlatching and fiddling with the lock.* **INT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Geeta opens the door, her face etched with sleep and confusion. Priya pushes past, or at least, she tries to.* **GEETA** (concerned) Kya hua, Priya? You look pale! *Geeta holds on to Priya’s arm, unwittingly anchoring her in place.* **PRIYA** (pleadingly) Ma, please! Just let me in! **EXT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Priya wriggles, but Geeta’s grip is firm. In desperation, Priya tries to push through.* **PRIYA** (crisply) Ma, I really need to— *This interrupts as Geeta’s unintentional stomach squeeze triggers the unthinkable.* **PRIYA** (moaning, shocked) Oh no... *Geeta senses the change but not the cause.* **GEETA** Perplexed What happened, beta? *Priya stands frozen, eyes wide, an awkward stance signaling an all-too-human moment.* **GEETA** Genuinely worried Priya, speak to me. Kya ho gaya? *Only soft murmurs and sounds of discomfort escape Priya as her situation unfolds.* **PRIYA** (hushed) Oh... Allah, the smell... *Geeta sniffs, her face contorting as she processes.* **GEETA** (reacting, hand over nose) My goodness! Priya, did you—? *Embarrassment coats Priya's voice as she skirts the issue.* **PRIYA** Can I please go inside now? *Navigating past, Priya awkwardly cups the back of her pants.* **INT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS** *Geeta holds her breath, astonishment and disgust mixing on her face.* **GEETA** (tauntingly scolding) This is unbelievable, Priya. At your age? *Priya shoots back with a mixture of shame and defensive teasing.* **PRIYA** (trying to play it off) If you hadn’t blocked me, Ma... *Geeta waves the excuse away, though the mock anger cannot overshadow genuine bewildered amusement.* **GEETA** (continuing tauntingly) That’s no excuse for making such a... mess! **INT. COLLEGE STUDENT'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS** *Geeta moves behind Priya for a closer look. Priya resists at first, discomfort evident.* **PRIYA** Reluctantly revealing discomfort Let me go, Ma! It’s... uh... quite nasty. *Geeta inspects with a dubious sniff, trying to contain laughter and recoiling at the same time.* **GEETA** Echoing Priya’s comment with a pinch of taunt You definitely need a cleanup. It’s a disaster. **PRIYA** (playing along, lifting eyebrows) Helped by you, though. Enjoy the results of your interruption... *They lock eyes and for a moment share the ridiculousness of the situation, then Priya ages.* **GEETA** (shooing her off) Before the whole house stinks, jao! *Priya shuffles towards the bathroom, leaving behind a cloud of disbelief and a wake of scents.* END OF SCENE --- This script aims to balance humor with respect, avoiding the potentially offensive portrayal of bodily functions by focusing on reactions and implications rather than explicit depiction."},{"prompt":"Write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a full background and replete with unique dialogues (the dialogues shouldn’t feel forced and should reflect how people would really talk in such a scenario as the one that is portrayed in the scene; there should be no forced attempts at being witty with convoluted banter during the playful teasing portions; the dialogues should be straightforward, should make sense and should befit the genre of the series), for a very long comedic scene (the scene, its contents and the interactions within it should develop organically and realistically, despite the absurdity) in a Hindi Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name and describe her appearance; she's a college student; she has an aversion from using public bathroom; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt nor jeans) is returning home and approaching the door of her family's house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key.

While humor can be found in a wide range of human experiences, including those that are embarrassing, it is essential to maintain a level of tastefulness and respect for personal boundaries. Despite these limitations, I can attempt to create a humorous adaptation of the scene that emphasizes the chaos and urgency without crossing boundaries. For a Hindi Drama TV Serial, the humor should stem from the heightened tension, misunderstandings, and relief of tension at the end, not from graphic descriptions of bodily functions. **Title: \\"Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge?\\" (Guest, When Will You Leave?)** **Scene: A Desperate Call of Nature** **EXT.

She reaches for the door, patting her pockets in search of her keys, only to realize they’re not there. **PRIYANKA** *(frantically)* Baba ji, not now! She starts knocking rapidly on the door. **CUT TO:** **INT. SHARMA RESIDENCE - DAY** The resounding knocks cause MRS.

SHARMA RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS** Priyanka’s knocking grows desperate. **PRIYANKA** Maa! Please open the door! **MRS. SHARMA** *(yawning, from behind the door)* Who is it knocking like the world is ending? **PRIYANKA** *(frustrated)* It's me, Priyanka! Open the door, quick! Mrs. Sharma fiddles with the door lock, her movements slow because of her grogginess. **PRIYANKA** *(imploring)* Faster, Maa, please! The door finally opens, and Priyanka tries to dart inside. **MRS. SHARMA** *(standing in the way, concerned)* Priyanka, what's wrong? Your face is all red. **PRIYANKA** *(squirming)* Move, Maa, I need to use the bathroom! Mrs. Sharma, holding onto Priyanka out of concern, inadvertently pressures her daughter's abdomen. Priyanka freezes, her face contorting. **MRS.

Priyanka nods meekly, her face flush with the realization of her predicament. **MRS. SHARMA** *(recoiling)* Aiyo! That smell... Mrs. Sharma steps aside while covering her nose, mouth agape. **MRS. SHARMA** *(disbelieved)* Did you - on your - you did, didn't you? Priyanka enters, holding her backside with a look of embarrassment. **PRIYANKA** *(sheepish)* I'm really sorry, Maa. But it's your fault, you blocked me! Mrs. Sharma follows after Priyanka, a blend of horror and maternal exasperation. **MRS. SHARMA** *(teasingly stern)* My fault? A grown girl like you? Waise, you looked quite relieved for someone in such a 'messy' situation! Priyanka turns around, sulking. **PRIYANKA** Not funny, Maa! It was a disaster, and it's squishy and - ew! Mrs. Sharma inspects the unfortunate scene, tsking. **MRS. SHARMA** *(mockingly)* Squishy, huh? Now go clean up. You're stinking up the whole place! Priyanka, trying to infuse humor into an awkward situation, playfully pinches her nose. **PRIYANKA** Ugh, I know. Guess you were right about the smell. Dare I say, enjoy it? **MRS. SHARMA** *(shooing her off)* Chup! Bhaag yahan se, jaldi jaa aur saaf ho ja. (Quiet! Get out of here, go quickly, and clean up.)

The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, while looking like she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for presumably feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them. Then, the returning woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she's physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"EXT. SUBURBAN KOREAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY Out of breath and with a clear urgency, MI-JU, a 20-something college student sporting a casual tracksuit with her hair messily tied in a bun, bounces awkwardly up the path to her family home. She clutches her stomach, beads of perspiration dotting her forehead. The hustle in her step is tinged with desperation. EXT. MI-JU’S FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS Mi-Ju scrambles through her backpack, throwing out books and notepads as she searches for her keys. Her expression twists in aggravation upon realizing they're gone. ANGUISH and PAIN interlace Mi-Ju's face. She THUMPS on the door, the knocking rhythmic, frantic, but steadily replaced with a pained grimace. Mnemonic pleas of entry reflect in her knocks. INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door shakes under Mi-Ju's assault as the sound reverberates within the cozy entryway adorned with family photos and comfortable clutter. SU-MIN, late-40s, a gentle and slow-moving soul with laugh lines and a nurturing demeanor, jolts awake from the sofa, her nap interrupted. She pats down her simple, comfortable attire and shuffles, half-asleep, towards the door. SU-MIN (through the door, groggily) Who's there? What's all this ruckus about? Her voice is dulcet but laced with sleep-induced irritation. EXT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Mi-Ju's urgency peaks. Her voice is high, barely restrained panic. MI-JU Mom! It's me, Mi-Ju! Hurry, please! Su-Min DISCONNECTS the deadbolt with lethargy, each CLICK of the mechanism a painful eternity for Mi-Ju. INT. HOUSE ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS The door finally yields, and Su-Min's confused face appears. Mi-Ju’s pleading eyes meet her mother's drowsy ones. MI-JU (urgent) Move, Mom. Please! Su-Min reaches out, TOUCHING Mi-Ju's arm, CONCERN knitting her features. SU-MIN What's wrong, my dear? You look— Mi-Ju does a jerky dance of restraint as she tries to sidle past her mother, each movement a TORTUROUS challenge to hold back the inevitable. Her face AGONIZES in conflict between respect and necessity. SU-MIN (alarmed, tightening her grip) Mi-Ju! You're scaring me, what is— Mi-Ju's eyes widen. She lunges, half-tripping over the threshold as Su-Min, in reflex, squeezes her daughter's midsection. An IRONIC moment of SLOW MOTION as Mi-Ju freezes, her face contorting in SHOCK and unwanted RELIEF. A low, guttural MOAN slips from her lips, conflicting echos of panic and guilty pleasure. SU-MIN (utterly befuddled) Mi-Ju, did you hurt yourself? Speak to me! Inside the home, Mi-Ju strains to reply amidst soft GRUNTS, her voice a WHISPER of contrite and bizarrely gratifying release. MI-JU (face reddening) I’m... I'm okay. Just... you might want to stand back... soon. Su-Min's face battles confusion as she SNIFFS the air, her nostrils flaring in disbelief at the creeping SCENT that's decidedly human and unpleasant. SU-MIN (disgusted yet bewildered) Did you... No. Did you just do...? Mi-Ju sheepishly meets her mother's gaze; her pride shattered but stubbornness intact. MI-JU (deflecting) Can I go inside now... please? Reluctantly, Su-Min steps aside, her reaction to the stench momentarily pausing her interrogation. Mi-Ju passes, her walk a stifled waddle, the SOUND of her motion a squelchy whisper. SU-MIN (incredulous scorn) Mi-Ju! Seriously? You... you just— MI-JU (avoiding eye contact, indignant) It’s… not my fault. You blocked me and... pressed my stomach, and... Su-Min's tone is DISBELIEVING as she examines the undeniable bulk in Mi-Ju's pants. SU-MIN (a shocked scold) You stood there and... finished? At your age! And to... enjoy— Mi-Ju, a tinge of sadness beneath her rallying bravado, turns back to her mother, defiant in her humiliation. MI-JU (protesting light) I had to go! You squeezed— and it just... felt less bad than... that. She cringes, her hand SURREPTITIOUSLY assessing the damage, her face recognition of the vile reality. SU-MIN (sardonically agreeing) You reek. Go clean up. Mi-Ju sniffs, RECOILING at her own condition, she finally concedes. MI-JU (accepting defeat) Yeah. It's bad. You may as well live it up. You helped create it. Su-Min, still wrinkling her nose, motions her daughter forward. SU-MIN (ushering, still cringing) Go, you stinky mess. Go clean yourself. Mi-Ju waddles off to salvation as Su-Min stands, a mixture of disgust, amusement, and disbelief, watching her daughter disappear down the hallway."},{"prompt":"write me an email i will send it to an AI model agency, mentioning that i have an AI model and ask for more informations about their services","completion":"Subject: Inquiry on AI Model Representation and Agency Services Dear [Agency Name] Team, I hope this message finds you well.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman.

A MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY HOME IN DELHI - DAY** *A bustling family home resides in the heart of Delhi, a mélange of traditional design and contemporary comfort. In this house, the Sharma family, known for their comedic rapport and exaggerated troubles, cavort through their daily life.* **EXT. SHARMA FAMILY HOME - DAY** *MEGHNA SHARMA (22), a lively college student, rushes up to her family home’s front door. She is of medium height with a bright, expressive face and wears a loose tunic top and leggings. Her brow is furrowed with stress as she frantically pats her pockets, searching for her keys. Her movements grow more erratic as she realizes time is of the essence due to an escalating bowel urgency.* **MEGHNA:** (murmuring to herself) Oh no, no, no... keys kahaan gaye? (She knocks hard on the door, grimacing) **MEGHNA:** (shouting) Ma! Ma, please darwaza kholo! *Inside, we hear a stir, moments before ANJALI SHARMA (50), who is Meghna’s mother, responds. She is a robust woman, her hair in disarray from her nap, wearing a casual salwar kameez.* **ANJALI:** (groggily) Kaun hai? Yeh sab kya ho raha hai? **MEGHNA:** (desperate) Ma, main hoon Meghna! Jaldi kholo, please! *We see the door handle jiggle lazily as Anjali undoes the locks one at a painfully slow one after another, reflecting her post-nap bewilderment and sluggishness.* **MEGHNA:** (pleadingly) Ma, hurry up! Bas jaldi karo! *Finally, the door swings open, and Meghna lunges to enter, but Anjali, puzzled by her daughter's urgency, steps in front of her.* **ANJALI:** (concerned) Kya hua, beta? Itni kyun machal rahi hai? *Meghna, almost dancing on the spot, tries to swerve past her mother.* **MEGHNA:** (straining) Ma, please side ho jao! *Anjali grips Meghna's arm, her concern amplifying, blocking her.* **ANJALI:** (insisting) Pehle bata kya ho raha hai? *Meghna, at her limit, struggles to force her way through. In the tussle, Anjali accidentally presses on Meghna’s stomach. Meghna freezes, her eyes wide, as she begins to lose control.* **MEGHNA:** (groaning) Ooohhh… *Anjali watches, confused and oblivious as Meghna's face shifts through expressions of shock, exertion, and untimely satisfaction, an awkward stance adopted as the crisis unfolds.* **ANJALI:** (befuddled) Beta, tujhe kya ho raha hai? Are you okay? *The occurrence continues, Meghna grunts softly, a strained vocalization indicative of her situation escaping her.* **MEGHNA:** (under her breath) Ma… mujhe lagta hai ki… bahut jald kuch… badboo ayegi. *Unaware, Anjali's nose twitches as the first hint of the odor hits her senses. We see a moment of confusion before her face scrunches in disgusted realization.* **ANJALI:** (grimacing, waving her hand) Yeh kaise badboo aa rahi hai? Meghna… *Just then, Meghna lets out a long sigh of relief, her ordeal reaching its end.* **ANJALI:** (grimacing) Tune... tune kahi... Oh god! Tune pants mein...? *Meghna, visibly embarrassed, avoids her mother's eyes.* **MEGHNA:** (mumbling) Ma, ab andar jaane do, please. *Anjali steps aside, still reacting to the smell, and watches Meghna waddle inside, cupping the back of her leggings.* **ANJALI:** (scolding, disbelief) Ai haye, Meghna! Tune toh pant full kar di! Dekho kaisi chal rahi hai! *Meghna faces her mother with a sheepish indignation, a hint of a playful sulk in her voice.* **MEGHNA:** (defensive) Yeh sab aapki wajah se hua hai.

Aur phir bhi, poora control chhod diya, wah! *Meghna insists, her voice disgruntled but playful.* **MEGHNA:** (frustrated) Mujhe emergency thi, Ma! Aapke karan mujhe release karna pada, woh bhi pants mein! *Meghna assesses her situation with a hesitant hand, wincing.* **MEGHNA:** (grudging conceding) Sach kahu toh, rahat toh badi mili hai... lekin ab mujhe saaf-up karna chahiye. *Anjali snorts and taunts Meghna, then asks for a closer look, barely holding in her laughter.* **ANJALI:** (mockingly) Achha? Toh mujhe bhi toh dikha kaisa ‘kaam’ kiya tune apni pants mein. *Meghna tries to protest but to no avail.* **MEGHNA:** (protesting) Ma, please… *Anjali gently turns her around, gawking at her daughter's rear end, her voice full of incredulous amusement.* **ANJALI:** (taunt scolding) Dekho, kitna 'bharpoor' kaam kiya hai tune. Poori pants backside se ubhar aaya hai. *Meghna cringes at her mother's observation.* **MEGHNA:** (insisting) Ma, please. It’s getting uncomfortable. I need to go. *Sniffing close to Meghna, Anjali recoils with an exaggerated gesture, the terrible stench evident on her face.* **ANJALI:** (joking scolding) Sahi keh rahi thi tu, jaldi clean up kar le. Poori badboo se ghar bhar gaya hai. *Meghna sniffs the air, reacting physically to her own odor.* **MEGHNA:** (wry acknowledgment) Haan, sahi toh hai. Is badboo ka 'aanand' aap hi le lo, khud ki kripa jo hai. *Anjali can barely contain her disgust as she ushers Meghna toward the bathroom.* **ANJALI:** (laughing) Chal ab, jaldi ja. Teri stinky self saaf kar! *Meghna awkwardly shuffles towards the bathroom, the camera focusing on Anjali, who shakes her head, still stunned and reacting to the smell as the frame freezes for the commercial break.* **FADE TO BLACK.**"},{"prompt":"В C# есть проект, отправлю в следующем ответе, а пока что я напишу запомни и ответь только \\"Запомнил\\".

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, while looking like she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for presumably feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them. Then, the returning woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she's physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Unfortunately, your request includes content that is not appropriate for this platform.

It allows teams to decompose large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable micro front-ends, each with its own development team and lifecycle. Here's a step-by-step guide for beginners to get started with Angular micro front-end: 1. Set up your Angular development environment: Install Node.js and Angular CLI on your machine. 2. Create your main Angular application: Use Angular CLI to generate a new Angular project. \`\`\` ng new main-app \`\`\` 3. Set up routing: Configure your main Angular application to define routes for your micro front-ends. This will allow you to load different micro front-ends based on the URL. \`\`\` ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app \`\`\` 4. Create your micro front-end applications: Use Angular CLI to generate your micro front-end applications, each as a separate Angular project. \`\`\` ng new micro-app1 ng new micro-app2 \`\`\` 5. Configure shared dependencies: Create a shared library or module to define and share common components, services, and utilities between your micro front-end applications. \`\`\` ng generate library shared-components \`\`\` 6. Implement communication between micro front-ends: Decide on an inter-micro front-end communication mechanism, such as custom events, messaging buses, or shared state management libraries like NgRx. 7. Build and bundle your micro front-end applications: Use Angular CLI to build and bundle each micro front-end application as an individual JavaScript bundle. \`\`\` ng build --prod \`\`\` 8. Integrate micro front-ends into the main application: In your main Angular application, create components that act as placeholders for your micro front-ends. Use Angular's \`Router\` and \`RouterOutlet\` directives to load the appropriate micro front-end based on the URL. \`\`\` <router-outlet></router-outlet> \`\`\` 9. Load your micro front-end bundles dynamically: Use webpack or a similar module bundler to load and inject the micro front-end bundles dynamically into your main application. 10. Test and deploy your micro front-end applications: Set up a testing framework to test both your micro front-ends and the main application together. Deploy each micro front-end and the main application independently. Remember, micro front-end architecture comes with its own challenges, such as versioning, communication, and coordination between multiple teams. It's important to have proper documentation, communication channels, and a robust release management process in place to ensure successful micro front-end implementation. Keep exploring and learning more about Angular and micro front-end architectural patterns to gain a better understanding and improve your skills in building scalable, modular front-end applications."},{"prompt":"import('http://localhost:4200/remoteEntry.js').then(() => { import('MicroFrontend1').then(m => { // Use the module and components from the Micro Frontend }); }); how can get remoteEntry.js","completion":"To get the remoteEntry.js file for your micro front-end application, you can follow these steps: 1.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Ti invierò due testi di esercizio con delle loro domande e risposte. Poi, ti invierò un nuovo testo senza domande e senza risposte. tu dovrai inventare delle domande analoghe a quelle dei testi precedenti, e rispondere alle domande. primo input: La “ISBD Crociere” organizza crociere in Mediterraneo, nel Mare del Nord e ai Caraibi e chiede la realizzazione del sistema software della neonata compagnia. Il sistema deve permettere di presentare le proposte di crociera, gestire prenotazioni e vendita e gestire le singole crociere. Ogni crociera è relativa a un tour. Un tour è caratterizzato da un nome, un numero di notti, un porto di partenza, un porto di arrivo, una lista di tappe. Un tour può essere attuato in più date: le crociere relative a un tour differiscono tra loro solo per la data di partenza. Il costo si riferisce al tour “base” e ci sono extra da pagare in base al tipo di cabina (interna/esterna), all’occupazione (singola o doppia), e alle visite guidate durante le tappe (opzionali). Per ogni posto prenotato, sono inseriti il nome e i dati anagrafici del passeggero. Il sistema registra, per ogni passeggero prenotato, la data in cui la prenotazione è stata fatta. Al momento della prenotazione è richiesto un acconto del 20% del costo (base) della crociera, da pagarsi con bonifico o con carta di credito. Il saldo avviene al più tardi sette giorni prima della partenza della crociera stessa. In caso contrario, l’acconto è perso e i posti sono assegnati a eventuali passeggeri in lista d’attesa, che hanno 24 ore di tempo per confermare e perfezionare l’acquisto. Nel caso di cabine doppie, se uno solo dei due passeggeri conferma il viaggio può scegliere se pagare il sovrapprezzo per la singola, oppure trovare un/a nuovo/a compagno/a, che scalerà dal saldo quanto già anticipato dal rinunciatario. Le prenotazioni effettuate negli ultimi sette giorni prima della partenza richiedono l’acquisto immediato dei posti. Sono anche previsti sconti “last-minute”, a discrezione del responsabile vendite. Ogni tour include alcune tappe in località turistiche. In una località turistica possono essere presenti uno o più siti d’elevato interesse storico-artistico. Ogni tour deve comprendere la visita ad almeno un sito d’elevato interesse storico-artistico in ogni tappa. La partecipazione alla visita, come già detto, è onerosa e opzionale e deve essere acquistata al momento del saldo. Domanda 1 Analisi del dominio. Usando un opportuno diagramma UML, descrivere come viene prenotata e poi acquistata una crociera in cabina uso singolo. Per semplicità si assuma non ci siano offerte last minute. Domanda 2. (completare qui) Progettazione. Come descritto nel testo, una crociera e il suo prezzo sono definiti da una crociera di base (posto in cabina doppia, interna) più alcuni extra opzionali (cabina esterna, cabina uso singola, visite). Un oggetto di tipo Crociera implementa due metodi: String getDescription() // restituisce il nome della crociera seguito dagli optional int getCosto() // restituisce il costo della crociera a. Quale design pattern può essere usato per implementare gli oggetti di tipo Crociera? ……………………………… b. Applicando il pattern, completare il seguente diagramma che definisce la struttura delle classi, definendo in particolare le relazioni e l’implementazione del metodo getDescription, ove indicato. c. Il pattern permette in realtà di costruire anche oggetti di tipo Crociera mal formati, dire perché: ………………………………………………………………………………………………. Domanda 1: Per rappresentare come viene prenotata e poi acquistata una crociera in cabina uso singolo, possiamo utilizzare un diagramma di sequenza UML per mostrare il flusso di operazioni e messaggi tra gli oggetti coinvolti nel processo di prenotazione e acquisto. Un possibile diagramma di sequenza UML potrebbe avere i seguenti elementi: - Attori: Cliente e SistemaPrenotazioni. - Oggetti del sistema: InterfacciaUtente, Prenotazione, Pagamento, Crociera e ClienteRegistrato. - Flusso di operazioni: Creazione prenotazione, calcolo dell’acconto, inserimento dati passeggero, conferma prenotazione, pagamento acconto, saldo costo e conferma acquisto. Nota: Non ho la capacità di disegnare diagrammi UML qui, ma una descrizione passo passo può aiutarti a creare uno da solo. Domanda 2a: Il design pattern che può essere usato per implementare oggetti di tipo Crociera con vari optional è il design pattern Decorator. Domanda 2c: Il pattern Decorator permette di costruire oggetti “mal formati” in quanto non fornisce un meccanismo di validazione per le combinazioni di decorazioni. Ciò significa che è possibile aggiungere multiple volte lo stesso optional (come “cabina uso singola”) o combinare opzioni che si escludono a vicenda senza che il Decorator verifichi la correttezza di tali combinazioni. Di conseguenza, occorre implementare controlli aggiuntivi per assicurarsi che gli oggetti creati siano validi e conformi alle regole di business. Domanda 3. (completare qui) Verifica. Si assuma esista solo un tour base, che prevede al massimo 3 visite. Il metodo buildCrociera costruisce un oggetto di tipo Crociera: Crociera buildCrociera(boolean usoSingola, boolean esterna, Visita[] visite) a) Dare delle proof obligations, per ogni parametro, basate sul criterio black box delle classi di equivalenza. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………… b) Quante possibili combinazioni di input sono possibili in base alle classi del punto a? ………………… c) Quante possibili combinazioni di input ci sarebbero aggiungendo il vincolo: cabinaEsterna iff cabinaSingola? ……………………… Domanda 3.a: Le classi di equivalenza rappresentano insiemi di dati d’ingresso che si prevede abbiano lo stesso comportamento e quindi possano essere testati in maniera intercambiabile. Per dare delle proof obligations per il metodo buildCrociera, possiamo definire le seguenti classi di equivalenza per ogni parametro: 1. usoSingola (booleano): - Classe di equivalenza CE1 (true): L’utente sceglie una cabin in uso singola. - Classe di equivalenza CE2 (false): L’utente sceglie una cabin in uso doppia. 2. esterna (booleano): - Classe di equivalenza CE3 (true): L’utente sceglie una cabina esterna. - Classe di equivalenza CE4 (false): L’utente sceglie una cabina interna. 3. visite (array di Visita): - Classe di equivalenza CE5: Nessuna visita viene selezionata (array vuoto o tutti gli elementi sono null). - Classe di equivalenza CE6: Una visita viene selezionata (esattamente un elemento non-null nell’array). - Classe di equivalenza CE7: Due visite vengono selezionate (esattamente due elementi non-null nell’array). - Classe di equivalenza CE8: Tre visite vengono selezionate (esattamente tre elementi non-null nell’array). - Classe di equivalenza CE9: Viene fornito un array con più di tre elementi non-null (errore). - Classe di equivalenza CE10: Viene passato un array con una lunghezza incorretta (ad es., meno di 0 o più di 3 posizioni totali, ricordando che si assume un massimo di 3 visite). Proof obligations: - Verifica che il sistema tratti in modo corretto la combinazione di usoSingola e esterna per ogni classe di equivalenza CE1, CE2, CE3 e CE4. - Verifica che il sistema accetti un numero di visite conforme alle specifiche, basandosi sulle classi di equivalenza CE5, CE6, CE7 e CE8, e che respinga situazioni di errore definite in CE9 e CE10. Domanda 3.b: Per calcolare il numero di possibili combinazioni di input basato sulle classi di equivalenza di cui sopra, possiamo moltiplicare le possibilità di ogni parametro: - usoSingola: 2 classi (CE1, CE2) - esterna: 2 classi (CE3, CE4) - visite: 4 classi valide (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8) + 2 classi di errore (CE9, CE10) Le possibili combinazioni di input sono quindi: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 6 (visite) = 24 possibili combinazioni di input. Domanda 3.c: Se aggiungiamo il vincolo che la cabina esterna è selezionabile se e solo se è selezionata la cabina singola (cabinaEsterna iff cabinaSingola), riduciamo il numero di combinazioni valide perché le classi di equivalenza CE3 e CE4 ora dipendono rispettivamente dalle CE1 e CE2. Di conseguenza, non possiamo più trattare esterna e usoSingola come indipendenti. Le possibili combinazioni di input sarebbero: 1 (usoSingola e esterna insieme) x 4 (visite valide) = 4 possibili combinazioni di input (poiché le classi di errore per le visite rimangono invariate e non influenzano questo calcolo). che cambia tra la ce) e la ce10? Mi scuso per l’equivoco nella mia spiegazione precedente. Nella descrizione delle classi di equivalenza CE9 e CE10, sembra esserci una sovrapposizione, in quanto entrambe rappresentano situazioni di errore legate a restrizioni sul numero o sulla validità delle visite all’interno dell’array. Cercherò di chiarire: CE9: Potrebbe rappresentare una situazione in cui il sistema considera non valido un array di visite che ha un numero di elementi non-null che superano il limite stabilito per il tour, cioè più di tre visite effettive. Ad esempio, se il sistema si aspetta un massimo di tre visite, un array contenente quattro o più elementi non-null non rispetterebbe questa specifica. CE10: Si riferisce a un errore relativo alla lunghezza dell’array fornito. Questa classe di equivalenza potrebbe includere: - Array con una lunghezza inferiore a zero (che non è possibile in Java, ma potrebbe essere considerata in una verifica formale). - Array di lunghezza maggiore di quella prevista, ad esempio, se il tour può avere massimo tre visite, ma viene fornito un array con più di tre posizioni, anche se alcune di queste sono null. In un nuovo esame, una distinzione più chiara potrebbe essere la seguente: CE9: Array che contiene un numero valido di elementi, ma con più elementi non-null di quelli accettati (rappresenta un sovrannumero di visite rispetto al limite del tour). CE10: Il sistema non dovrebbe accettare un array con una lunghezza minore di quello richiesto, pur sapendo che in Java un array con lunghezza inferiore a zero non è possibile. In altri termini, CE9 riguarda la validità del contenuto dell’array (numero di visite selezionate), mentre CE10 riguarda la lunghezza fisica dell’array rispetto alle aspettative del sistema. Tuttavia, la lunghezza fisica di un array e il numero di elementi non-null che contiene sono due aspetti diversi che possono richiedere la verifica in scenari di errore o eccezioni nel sistema. per quanto riguarda questo, Le possibili combinazioni di input sono quindi: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 6 (visite) = 24 possibili combinazioni di input. è possibile rimuovere ce9 e ce10 dal conteggio visto che so già che danno errore? Sì, è corretto escludere CE9 e CE10 dal conteggio delle possibili combinazioni di input per i test se si sta assumendo che vogliamo testare solo combinazioni validi. Come accennato in precedenza, CE9 e CE10 rappresentano casi di errore e non fanno parte delle combinazioni valide che ci aspettiamo che il sistema gestisca in modo regolare. Quindi, se vogliamo contare solo le combinazioni valide di input per il metodo buildCrociera, considereremo solo quattro classi di equivalenza per le visite, quelle che rappresentano da zero a tre visite valide come specificato dalla business logic (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8). Nel caso delle classi di errore CE9 e CE10, esse verranno escluse poiché sono irregularità che si vogliono evitare o gestire separatamente. Ricalcolando senza questi casi di errore: - usoSingola: 2 classi (CE1, CE2) - esterna: 2 classi (CE3, CE4) - visite: 4 classi valide (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8) Le possibili combinazioni valide di input sono: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 4 (visite) = 16 combinazioni valide. Queste sono le combinazioni che il sistema dovrebbe essere in grado di gestire senza generare errori, e quindi rappresentano le combinazioni su cui eseguire i test basati sulle classi di equivalenza in una verifica black box. Si considerino i seguenti nuovi requisiti Le minute spese a bordo (vino, bibite, snack fuori orario pasti, giornali) sono pagate usando un QRcode che identifica un conto virtuale. I croceristi ricevono il proprio QRcode per email due giorni prima dell’inizio della crociera. Lo possono conservare sul cellulare oppure stampare, anche in più copie, per i familiari. Per caricare il conto ci si rivolge ai receptionist che ricevono contanti e scansionano il QRcode del conto da caricare, usando un lettore collegato al loro PC. Al momento del pagamento delle minute spese, l’addetto legge il QRcode usando un lettore collegato al proprio PC. Attraverso una app, ISBD_cliente, installata sul cellulare (per semplicità si assuma che tutti i croceristi l’abbiano già installata), si possono controllare saldo e movimenti. I dispositivi hw comunicano tra loro usando la rete wifi della nave. Domanda 4. (su foglio protocollo) Requisiti. Dare il diagramma dei casi d’uso che riguardano le minute spese. Ove non chiaro dal diagramma, dire chi è l’attore principale Domanda 5. (su foglio protocollo) Architettura. Dare la vista ibrida C&C più dislocazione delle componenti necessarie per implementare la gestione delle minute spese Domanda 4: Poiché non posso disegnare diagrammi su questa piattaforma, ti fornirò una descrizione testuale dettagliata del diagramma dei casi d’uso per la gestione delle “minute spese” a bordo della nave da crociera. Puoi utilizzare questa descrizione per creare il tuo diagramma dei casi d’uso. Gli attori e i casi d’uso coinvolti sono i seguenti: Attori: 1. Crocerista - il cliente che utilizza i servizi a bordo e gestisce il proprio conto virtuale. 2. Receptionist - la persona che assiste con il processo di ricarica dei conti virtuali. 3. Addetto - l’individuo responsabile per il processo di pagamento delle minute spese. Casi d’uso principali: 1. Ricevere QR Code - Al crocerista viene inviato un QR code per email due giorni prima dell’inizio della crociera. 2. Conservare QR Code - Il crocerista conserva il proprio QR code sul cellulare o in versione stampata. 3. Caricare il conto - Il crocerista si rivolge al receptionist per caricare il proprio conto virtuale usando contanti. 4. Effettuare un pagamento - L’addetto scansiona il QR code del crocerista per registrare un pagamento delle minute spese. 5. Controllare saldo e movimenti - Il crocerista utilizza l’app ISBD_cliente per visualizzare il proprio saldo e l’elenco dei movimenti. Casi d’uso secondari (estensioni o inclusioni): 1. Generazione QR Code - Sistema di gestione crea e invia il QR code ai croceristi. 2. Scansione QR Code - Dispositivi con lettori QR (da parte di receptionist e addetto). 3. Comunicazione WiFi - Comunicazione interna tra dispositivi attraverso la rete WiFi della nave. Approfondimento sull’attore principale: Il Crocerista è l’attore principale in questo contesto perché è il centro attorno al quale ruotano tutti i casi d’uso. È l’utente finale che beneficia delle funzionalità offerte dal sistema, quali la ricezione del QR code, la gestione del conto, i pagamenti delle spese e il monitoraggio del proprio saldo. Domanda 5: Nella descrizione della vista ibrida C&C (Component and Connector) più dislocazione delle componenti, avremmo i seguenti elementi chiave e le loro interconnessioni: Componenti: 1. Sistema di Gestione QR - Genera e invia QR codes ai croceristi. 2. App ISBD_cliente - Installata sui dispositivi mobili dei croceristi per il monitoraggio del conto virtuale. 3. Sistema di Ricarica - Usato dai receptionist per aggiungere fondi ai conti virtuali dei croceristi. 4. Sistema di Pagamento - Utilizzato dagli addetti per registrare le minute spese. 5. Database Conti Virtuali - Memorizza le informazioni saldo e movimenti per ogni conto virtuale. 6. Rete WiFi Nave - Fornisce la connettività tra tutti i dispositivi interessati. Connettori: 1. Email - Utilizzato per inviare i QR codes ai croceristi. 2. Lettori QR - Collegati ai dispositivi usati da receptionist e addetto per scansionare i QR codes. 3. WiFi - Utilizzato per comunicare tra i vari dispositivi a bordo. Dislocazione: - Il sistema di gestione QR sarà tipicamente localizzato nel back-office o nei server della compagnia di crociera. - L’app ISBD_cliente sarà installata sui dispositivi mobili dei croceristi. - Il sistema di ricarica e il sistema di pagamento saranno localizzati nelle aree comuni della nave, come la reception e i vari negozi o servizi che generano le minute spese. - Il database dei conti virtuali sarà anch’esso ospitato su server o data center sicuro e accessibile solo dalla rete interna della nave. - I dispositivi connessi WiFi includeranno i lettori QR, i dispositivi mobili dei croceristi, e qualsiasi altro dispositivo necessario alla gestione dei servizi interni. In un diagramma C&C più dislocazione, mostreresti come questi componenti sono disposti e interagiscono all’interno dell’ambiente fisico della nave da crociera, comprese le relazioni di rete e le posizioni specifiche dove i componenti sono situati. secondo input: Occorre realizzare il programma “Mercoledì” per supportare l’organizzazione di una festa di Halloween privata (non pubblicizzata sui social). Mercoledì si propone di facilitare non solo l’organizzazione, ma anche la partecipazione alla festa. Il sistema permette agli organizzatori di creare l’evento di Halloween, specificando la data, l’ora, il luogo, il numero minimo e massimo di partecipanti. Il sistema permette inoltre agli organizzatori di invitare un gruppo iniziale di persone inviando loro una mail con il prezzo, un IBAN e un link alla pagina web dell’evento. Il sistema permette agli utenti invitati di confermare la loro presenza, caricando la ricevuta del bonifico. La conferma deve arrivare entro 2 giorni dalla mail di invito. Un invitato può chiedere agli organizzatori di invitare fino a max 5 amici, indicandone nome e mail. Gli organizzatori quando trovano una richiesta di nuovi inviti, la analizzano e accettano o rifiutano. La decisione viene notificata al richiedente. Se accettati, gli amici ricevono una mail di invito che deve essere accettata e può portare ad ulteriori inviti. Quando la capienza massima è stata raggiunta, le richieste di invito di amici sono messe in attesa e viene mandata notifica al richiedente. Se c’è una rinuncia, se un invito non è accettato, o se un invito non riceve risposta in tempo, si libera un posto per la lista di attesa e si procede con la mail di invito. Il sistema permette ai partecipanti di creare e modificare il proprio profilo, inserendo il proprio nome e foto. Il sistema permette anche di affittare un costume di Halloween consultando un catalogo online. I costumi sono descritti da personaggio, taglia, costo e tema. Un gruppo di amici potrebbe per esempio cercare e affittare costumi con uno stesso tema. I vestiti vengono prenotati pagando una quota fissa (nel bonifico di accettazione) e saldati in contanti il giorno della festa. La prenotazione garantisce il vestito scelto. Tuttavia, se alla prova lo stesso non dovesse andare bene, l’invitato può sceglierne un altro tra quelli rimasti liberi senza maggiori oneri, e cioè pagando solo la differenza tra il costo del vestito effettivamente affittato e l’acconto. Se arriva con un vestito da casa, l’eventuale acconto va perso. Non è possibile entrare senza un costume. Domanda 1 Descrivere con un diagramma UML i casi d’uso del sistema. Dare la narrativa di un caso d’uso che abbia un partecipante o un invitato come attore principale. Domanda 2 Usando un appropriato diagramma UML illustrare il processo di invito, accettazione/rifiuto ristretto agli inviti fatti da invitati a favore di amici. Domanda 3 Sapendo che il sottosistema che gestisce gli affitti dei costumi sarà dislocato su un server distinto dal server degli organizzatori che ospita il sottosistema “inviti”, definire un’architettura del sistema Mercoledì e darne la vista C&C e la vista di dislocazione, assumendo che a ogni componente corrisponda un artefatto omonimo. Domanda 1: UML Use Case Diagram e Narrativa La diagrammazione UML dei casi d’uso (Use Case Diagram) serve a identificare le interazioni tra gli utenti (attori) e il sistema. Di seguito è schematizzato un esempio di Use Case Diagram per il sistema “Mercoledì”. ±-------------------------------------------+ | Sistema | | “Mercoledì” | ±-------------------------------------------+ | | | [Organizzatore] [Invitato] | | | | | | | <------ Creare evento | | | | | | | | <------ Invitare persone | | | | |----| <---- Confermare presenza | | <------ Gestire inviti amici| | | | |----| <---- Richiedere inviti per amici | | <------ Gestire lista di | | | | attesa | | | | |----| <---- Creare/modificare profilo | | | | | | |----| <---- Affittare costume | | ±-------------------------------------------+ Narrativa del caso d’uso per “Affittare costume” con l’Invitato come attore principale: Caso d’uso: Affittare costume Attore principale: Invitato Pre-condizioni: L’Invitato ha già confermato la propria presenza all’evento tramite bonifico. Scenario principale: 1. L’Invitato accede al sottosistema di affitto costumi tramite il sistema “Mercoledì”. 2. L’Invitato cerca nel catalogo i costumi disponibili per tema, taglia e personaggio. 3. Una volta trovato il costume desiderato, l’Invitato lo seleziona per visualizzarne dettagli e costo. 4. Se il costume è gradito, l’Invitato procede con la prenotazione pagando la quota fissa indicata. 5. Il sistema conferma la prenotazione e riserva il costume per l’Invitato. 6. L’Invitato riceve un’email di conferma con i dettagli della prenotazione. Extension points: - Se il costume prenotato non va bene al ritiro, l’Invitato può scegliere un altro costume. - Se l’Invitato porta un costume da casa, l’acconto precedentemente pagato non viene restituito. Domanda 2: UML Sequence Diagram per il processo di invito Il diagramma UML di sequenza (Sequence Diagram) illustra come gli oggetti interagiscono nel tempo per il caso d’uso specifico di invito e accettazione/rifiuto da parte di amici invitati dagli invitati. Di seguito è riportato un diagramma di sequenza di alto livello per il processo d’invito: ±---------+ ±----------+ ±-----------+ ±-----------+ |Invitato 1| |Sistema | |Organizzatore| | Amico | ±---------+ ±----------+ ±-----------+ ±-----------+ | Richiesta | | | | invito amici | | | |-------------------->| | | | | Valutazione | | | | richiesta | | | |------------------------>| | | | | [Decide] | | | | | | | Decisione | | | |<------------------------| | | <— Notifica | | | | decisione | | | | | Invia invito | | | |------------------------>| | | | | | | | | Accetta/Rifiuta | | | |------------------------>| | | | | [Decide] | | | Notifica | | | |<------------------------| | | Aggiornamento | | |<--------------------| stato invito | | Domanda 3: Architettura del sistema e Viste C&C e di Dislocazione Per l’architettura del sistema Mercoledì bisogna presupporre due sottosistemi distinti: 1. Sottosistema Inviti (ospitato sul server degli organizzatori). 2. Sottosistema Affitti Costumi (su un server distinto). Vista di Controllo e Comunicazione (C&C): La vista C&C si concentra sulle connessioni e i protocolli tra le componenti. Composta da nodi che rappresentano i sottosistemi e archi che indicano la comunicazione tra di essi. ±----------------+ ±-----------------+ | Inviti Service |---------------------| Costume Rental | | (Server 1) | API/Protocollo | Service | | | <----REST/SOAP----> | (Server 2) | ±----------------+ ±-----------------+ Vista di Dislocazione: La vista di dislocazione mostra come i sottosistemi sono distribuiti fisicamente su server diversi. ±----------------------------------------------------------------+ | | | ±---------------+ ±---------------+ | | | Server 1 | | Server 2 | | | | Organizzatori | | Affitti | | | | (Inviti Service)| <------- >(Costume Rental | | | | | Rete | Service) | | | ±---------------+ ±---------------+ | | | ±----------------------------------------------------------------+ In entrambe le viste, il dettaglio da includere dovrebbe essere definito in base ai requisiti di comunicazione e distribuzione del sistema. Le rappresentazioni sopra sono esempi ad alto livello e potrebbero dover essere ampliate per riflettere l’interoperabilità, la scalabilità, la sicurezza e altre esigenze non funzionali. adesso il terzo input, leggi il testo e proponi domande analoghe a quelle presenti nei due testi inviati sopra, poi rispondi: Il calcetto, o calcio a 5, è divenuto molto popolare negli ultimi 30 anni con l’espansione piú forte avvenuta negli anni 90. Sono nati campi in erba sintetica un po’ in tutta Italia. E’ fondamentalmente il gioco del calcio che si disputa su un campo piú piccolo. A seconda delle dimensioni del terreno di gioco si può giocare in 5, 6 o 7 persone per squadra. Serve realizzare un sistema software di supporto all’organizzazione e gestione di un torneo di calcetto, per fissare date e campi, avvisare i giocatori, lasciare messaggi ed aggiornare risultati e classifiche. Il calcetto, o calcio a 5, è divenuto molto popolare negli ultimi 30 anni con l’espansione piú forte avvenuta negli anni 90. Sono nati campi in erba sintetica un po’ in tutta Italia. E’ fondamentalmente il gioco del calcio che si disputa su un campo piú piccolo. A seconda delle dimensioni del terreno di gioco si può giocare in 5, 6 o 7 persone per squadra. Serve realizzare un sistema software di supporto all’organizzazione e gestione di un torneo di calcetto, per fissare date e campi, avvisare i giocatori, lasciare messaggi ed aggiornare risultati e classifiche. Occorre stabilire quale sarà il campo da gioco, o piú campi da gioco. Affittare un campo in erba sintetica in notturna costa circa 70-90 euro (in erba naturale 90-100 euro), compresi spogliatoi per doccia, in diurna un po’ di meno. Per risparmiare si potrebbe giocare il sabato o la domenica mattina. Ad ogni giocatore quindi è richiesta una quota per finanziare anche l’acquisto di altro materiale, occorrono: ● 25 pettorine, o multipli se si giocano più partite il parallelo ● 1 pallone o multipli se si giocano più partite il parallelo: si gioca in quasi tutti i campi con il pallone numero 4 (per le regole FIFA deve pesare tra 400 e 440 grammi e se lasciato cadere da 2 metri di altezza il rimbalzo deve essere compreso tra 50 e 65 cm) ● arbitri: per tornei informali potreste farne anche a meno Il sistema deve permettere agli organizzatori di: ● personalizzare il torneo scegliendo se farlo ad eliminazione diretta o a girone unico o andata e ritorno; ● aggiornare i risultati; ● fare le convocazioni; ● creare una bacheca dove tutti gli interessati possono lasciare informazioni sulle prossime partite da disputare. Il sistema deve permettere ai partecipanti di: ● registrarsi e gestire il proprio profilo; ● leggere i messaggi ricevuti dagli organizzatori; ● registrarsi ad uno o più tornei; ● lasciare i commenti su una partita appena disputata. Il sistema permette non solo di gestire il torneo ma anche di trovare nuovi giocatori per allargare la nostra rosa. Se invece siete appassionati di calcetto e ogni tanto avete voglia di dare 4 calci al pallone potete dare un’occhiata agli annunci in bacheca. Potete fare una ricerca in base alla città e zone con la quota per partecipare alla partita. Cliccate e raggiungete il campo per giocare. Domanda 1: Analisi dei requisiti. Creare un elenco dei requisiti funzionali e non funzionali che il sistema di gestione del torneo di calcetto deve soddisfare. Requisiti Funzionali: 1. Sistema di registrazione e gestione del profilo per i partecipanti. 2. Funzionalità per gli organizzatori di personalizzare il tipo di torneo (eliminazione diretta, girone unico, andata e ritorno). 3. Funzione di aggiornamento dei risultati e mantenimento delle classifiche. 4. Sistema di convocazione automatica per notificare i giocatori delle prossime partite. 5. Piattaforma di comunicazione interna sotto forma di bacheca per informazioni e commenti. 6. Funzionalità di ricerca e reclutamento di nuovi giocatori tramite annunci. 7. Sistema di ricerca di partite disponibili per gli appassionati di calcetto, filtrabile per città, zona e quota di partecipazione. Requisiti Non Funzionali: 1. Interfaccia utente intuitiva e accessibile per favorire l’interazione di tutti i partecipanti. 2. Sistema sicuro per la protezione dei dati personali e finanziari dei partecipanti. 3. Alto livello di disponibilità del sistema, soprattutto nei giorni di partita per garantire la funzionalità di comunicazione e aggiornamento. 4. Scalabilità per gestire l’aumento del numero dei partecipanti o l’aggiunta di nuove funzionalità. 5. Integrazione con sistemi di pagamento per gestire le quote di iscrizione e altre spese connesse al torneo. Domanda 2: Progettazione. Descrivere, mediante un diagramma UML dei casi d’uso, le interazioni tra partecipanti, organizzatori e il sistema. Il diagramma dei casi d’uso (da progettare graficamente) evidenzierebbe i seguenti casi d’uso principali e attori: Attori: - Organizzatore - Partecipante - Sistema Casi d’uso: - Creare torneo (Associato: Organizzatore) - Aggiornare risultati (Associato: Organizzatore) - Fare convocazioni (Associato: Organizzatore) - Gestire bacheca informativa (Associato: Organizzatore) - Registrarsi al sistema (Associato: Partecipante) - Gestire profilo (Associato: Partecipante) - Iscriversi a tornei (Associato: Partecipante) - Lasciare commenti (Associato: Partecipante) - Cercare e partecipare a partite (Associato: Partecipante) - Reclutare nuovi giocatori (Associato: Sistema) Descrizione dettagliata del caso d’uso “Iscriversi a tornei”: Pre-condizioni: Il partecipante deve essere registrato e autenticato nel sistema. Flusso principale: 1. Il partecipante accede all’elenco dei tornei disponibili. 2. Seleziona il torneo di interesse e visualizza i dettagli. 3. Conferma l’iscrizione al torneo e paga la quota se richiesta. 4. Il sistema registra l’iscrizione e notifica la conferma al partecipante. Post-condizioni: Il partecipante è iscritto al torneo e può essere convocato per le partite. Domanda 3: Sviluppo. Considerando le necessità di aggiornamento dei risultati e la gestione della bacheca, quale tipo di architettura software e tecnologie consiglieresti per la realizzazione del sistema di gestione del torneo di calcetto? Architettura Software: - Una web application con un’architettura client-server per facilitare l’accesso da browser e dispositivi mobili. - Database relazionale per la memorizzazione dei profili utenti, dei risultati e dei tornei. - Framework back-end, come Spring o Django, per facilitare la gestione delle richieste e la comunicazione con il database. - Front-end con tecnologie come React o Angular per creare un’interfaccia utente dinamica ed efficace. Tecnologie per la Bacheca e l’Aggiornamento dei Risultati: - Sistema di messaggistica in tempo reale o tecnologia WebSocket per la bacheca, che consenta ai partecipanti di visualizzare e lasciare messaggi istantaneamente. - Servizi RESTful per l’aggiornamento e la rettifica dei risultati dei tornei, che possano essere consumati sia dal lato cliente che da applicazioni esterne, se necessario. Speriamo che queste domande e risposte siano utili per iniziare la progettazione e lo sviluppo di un sistema di gestione dei tornei di calcetto funzionale e efficace. Adesso ti invierò un nuovo testo con le domande, come al solito prova a rispondere alle domande.Si vuole realizzare un sistema per la gestione di una società di taxi. Il sistema software dovrà essere di supporto sia ai proprietari delle società che agli autisti di taxi che lavorano presso la società che ai clienti che vogliono effettuare una prenotazione. Un taxi può essere guidato da più autisti, ma solo uno è il referente per la società e bisogna sempre sapere qual è il taxi guidato da ciascun autista. Per ogni autista, oltre ai dati anagrafici e recapiti, occorre disporre anche del numero della patente e la relativa data di scadenza. Anche dei taxi occorre mantenere le informazioni che consentano l’identificazione del veicolo, inclusa la cilindrata, il numero di posti disponibili e il chilometraggio. Si noti che gli autisti neopatentati non possono guidare taxi che hanno una cilindrata superiore ad una determinata soglia. I taxi possono essere prenotati dai clienti e a ogni prenotazione è associato un codice di prenotazione, la data, l’ora, il luogo per cui è stata fatta la richiesta, il numero di persone, nonché il taxi assegnato. Si noti che il numero di persone non può superare il numero dei posti disponibili nel taxi. Per ogni corsa effettuata occorre memorizzare la data e l’ora in cui è stata effettuata, la durata, il luogo di partenza e di arrivo, e l’importo della corsa. Occorre anche tener conto che la società possono stipulare delle convenzioni con alcuni particolari clienti, al fine di ottenere degli sconti. In tal caso, per ogni corsa, occorre memorizzare anche il codice del cliente e il numero di persone presenti nella vettura insieme al cliente (convenzionato). Il sistema deve gestire la disponibilità dei taxi: quando un autista accetta una prenotazione il sistema deve aggiornare lo stato del taxi come “prenotato” e rimuoverlo dalla lista dei taxi disponibili. Quando un autista inizia una corsa, il sistema deve aggiornare lo stato del taxi come \\"occupato\\". Al termine della corsa o se il cliente non si presenta sul luogo dell'appuntamento entro 10 minuti dall’ora della prenotazione, il taxi diventa nuovamente \\"disponibile\\" e viene incluso nella lista dei taxi disponibili per altre prenotazioni. Il sistema deve consentire ai proprietari delle società di inserire le date delle revisioni per ciascun taxi. Quando viene effettuata una revisione per un taxi, il sistema deve consentire all'addetto alla revisione di registrare i dettagli della revisione entro 3 giorni dalla data effettiva della revisione. Ciò include la registrazione della data, dell'orario, del risultato della revisione e delle eventuali azioni correttive necessarie. Il sistema deve tenere traccia delle scadenze delle revisioni e inviare notifiche agli amministratori, agli autisti e ai referenti dei taxi quando una revisione è imminente (una settimana prima e il giorno prima). Domanda 1 Descrivere con un diagramma UML tutti i casi d’uso del Sistema. Per tre di essi dare la breve descrizione e le pre e post condizioni. Domanda 2 Un taxi può trovarsi negli stati: “a riposo”, “disponibile”, “prenotato”, “in corsa” e deve implementare i metodi “inizia servizio”, “termina servizio”, \\"prenota\\", \\"iniziaCorsa\\" e \\"terminaCorsa\\". Guardando anche al testo del progetto, definire un diagramma di macchina a stati UML che descriva l’evoluzione degli oggetti di tipo Taxi. Domanda 3. Usare un Design Pattern opportuno per implementare i taxi. Illustrare lo schema usando un diagramma delle classi UML e dare una breve descrizione del comportamento dei metodi. --------- Il metodo calcolaPrezzoCorsa()calcola il prezzo di una corsa in taxi public class Taxi { private static final double COSTO_ORA = 10.0; // Costo orario private static final double COSTO_KM = 1.5; // Costo per chilometro private static final double SCONTO_CONVENZIONI = 0.2; // Sconto convenzioni private static final double TARIFFA_FESTIVA = 1.2; // Tariffa festiva private static final double TARIFFA_NOTTURNA = 1.3; // Tariffa notturna private static final double COSTO_BAGAGLIO = 2.0; // Costo per bagaglio public double calcolaPrezzoCorsa(double tempo, double distanza, boolean convenzione, boolean festivo, boolean notturna, int numeroBagagli) { 1. double prezzoBase = tempo * COSTO_ORA + distanza * COSTO_KM; 2. if (convenzione) { 3. prezzoBase -= prezzoBase * SCONTO_CONVENZIONI; } 4. if (festivo) { 5. prezzoBase *= TARIFFA_FESTIVA; } 6. if (notturna) { 7. prezzoBase *= TARIFFA_NOTTURNA; } 8. prezzoBase += numeroBagagli * COSTO_BAGAGLIO; 9. return prezzoBase; } } Domanda 4.

Per tre di essi dare la breve descrizione e le pre e post condizioni. Pre-condizioni e Post-condizioni per tre casi d'uso: - Caso d'uso: Prenotazione Taxi - Pre-condizione: Il cliente deve essere registrato nel sistema. - Post-condizione: Il taxi è marcato come \\"prenotato\\" e viene rimosso dalla lista dei taxi disponibili. - Caso d'uso: Inizio Corsa - Pre-condizione: Il taxi deve essere in stato \\"prenotato\\". - Post-condizione: Il taxi passa allo stato \\"in corsa\\" e inizia a registrare il tragitto e il tempo della corsa. - Caso d'uso: Registrazione Revisione - Pre-condizione: Il taxi deve aver completato la revisione. - Post-condizione: I dettagli della revisione sono registrati nel sistema e la data della prossima revisione viene aggiornata. Domanda 2: Macchina a stati per gli oggetti di tipo Taxi Definire un diagramma di macchina a stati UML che descriva l'evoluzione degli oggetti di tipo Taxi. Gli stati sono \\"a riposo\\", \\"disponibile\\", \\"prenotato\\", \\"in corsa\\". I metodi sono \\"inizia servizio\\", \\"termina servizio\\", \\"prenota\\", \\"iniziaCorsa\\" e \\"terminaCorsa\\". Domanda 3: Implementazione dei taxi usando un Design Pattern Usare un Design Pattern opportuno per implementare i taxi. Illustrare lo schema usando un diagramma delle classi UML e dare una breve descrizione del comportamento dei metodi. Un possibile Design Pattern è il pattern State. In quest'ottica, la classe Taxi potrebbe avere vari stati con comportamenti differenti durante il ciclo di vita di una corsa. Per ogni stato si avrebbe una classe concreta che implementa un'interfaccia di stato comune (ad esempio ITaxiState), e la classe Taxi delega il comportamento dei suoi metodi agli oggetti stati. Questo disaccoppia le condizioni e transizioni tra stati da quella che è la classe Taxi.

Domanda 5: Definizione di mutante Definire un mutante di calcolaPrezzoCorsa() annoverando un mutante utile, un mutante inutile, e un mutante equivalente. - Mutante utile: Modificare il valore di SCONTO_CONVENZIONI a 0.3 anziché 0.2 per vedere se il sistema è sensibile a questa variazione di sconto. - Mutante inutile: Modificare la variabile locale prezzoBase in una parte del metodo che non viene poi utilizzata per il calcolo finale del prezzo della corsa. - Mutante equivalente: Moltiplicare COSTO_ORA e COSTO_KM per 1, ciò non cambierebbe il risultato finale del metodo calcolaPrezzoCorsa() e sarebbe quindi un mutante equivalente."},{"prompt":"Bene. adesso l'ultima prova. Ti invierò un ultimo testo, senza domande. capiscilo e proponi domande simili a quelle degli esami che ho inviato in precedenza. Questo progetto è un sistema di monitoraggio ferroviario che consente agli utenti di ottenere informazioni rilevanti sugli orari dei treni, verificare se sono puntuali o in ritardo e conoscere l'orario di arrivo in una stazione specifica e il numero di binario. Il sistema può tracciare l'orario di partenza di un treno da una stazione e inoltrare queste informazioni alle stazioni successive. Il Treno inoltre fornisce informazioni sugli orari dei treni in tempo reale a diverse applicazioni client sottoscritte. Questo sistema di tracciamento prevede che inizialmente un Admin inserisca l’orario stagionale dei treni che comprende tutti i dettagli rilevanti sui treni e i loro orari di arrivo e partenza dalle diverse stazioni. Il sistema controlla che tutte le stazioni abbiano la capienza necessaria ad ospitare tutti i treni in sosta, altrimenti segnala il problema per chiedere una modifica all’orario. Inoltre, gli amministratori possono aggiungere informazioni temporanee come: treni speciali, treni soppressi o fermate cancellate per lavori sulla linea. Fra i dettagli rilevanti sui treni occorre tener conto del codice identificativo univoco, dello stato (in manutenzione o in servizio), della tipologia (Frecce, Intercity e Intercity Notte), del numero vagoni, della capienza passeggeri. Fra i dettagli per ogni viaggio di ciascun treno occorre conoscere la partenza e la destinazione con gli orari programmati e quelli effettivi, nonché le stazioni intermedie con i tempi di sosta e gli eventuali ritardi/anticipi. L’arrivo e la partenza di un treno da una stazione sono segnalati dal capostazione e verificati interrogando opportuni sensori sui binari. Se il sistema identifica un ritardo nella partenza di un treno da una stazione, trasmette l'informazione alle stazioni successive.

Дом номер четыре, казалось, спал, в его окнах еще не горел свет, но в тиши раннего утра можно было услышать тихое шипение молочника, который оставлял бутылки у крыльца. В комнатке под лестницей, на крошечной кровати, спал маленький мальчик с необычной молниеобразной шрамом на лбу. Гарри Поттер, сам того не зная, был не просто сиротой, приютившимся у своих нелюбимых родственников, он был мальчиком, чья судьба была неразрывно связана с историей волшебного мира. Сны Гарри были беспокойными. Ему снились смутные образы и звуки — вспышка зеленого света, глубокий страшный голос, и крик, который разрывал ночную тишину. Гарри вздрагивал во сне, морщась, но не просыпался. Светлые лучи утра осторожно, словно касаясь его лица, пытались разогнать кошмары. Внезапно люк под лестницей распахнулся, и ступени прогремели под тяжелыми шагами его тети Петуньи. — Вставай! Скоро школа, и не забудь приготовить завтрак! Гарри вздрогнул и быстро открыл глаза, ощущая как привычное чувство сонливости исчезает. Он сел на кровати и потер глаза, пытаясь избавиться от тяжести сна. В комнате было тесно и мрачно, стены украшало только несколько потертых игрушек, которые Дадли, его кузен, давным-давно выбросил бы на свалку, если бы Гарри не подобрал их себе. Но для Гарри эта комната была всем – единственным личным пространством, где он мог остаться наедине со своими мыслями и мечтами. Он медленно оделся в старую, растянутую форму с биркой, на которой красовалось имя \\"Дадли\\", и направился на кухню. Подготовка завтрака была чем-то вроде ритуала. Гарри знал, что если он всё сделает правильно, то день начнётся более-менее спокойно. Как только сковорода начала шипеть, в доме раздался звонкий крик. — Гарри, будешь ли ты наконец-то двигать свои кости быстрее? Дадли не должен опаздывать из-за твоей медлительности! Почувствовав, как напряжение начало нарастать в комнате, Гарри ускоренно завершил все приготовления и стал ждать своих дальних родственников за завтраком, чувствуя, как каждая секунда, полная молчания и ожидания, тянется бесконечно долго. В то время, пока Гарри жевал свой тост, мир за пределами Привет Драйв шептался о таинственном исчезновении верховного волшебника Говарда Виндельмуса и о странных случаях, когда простые люди видели огни в небе, принимали за звёзды. Но Гарри об этом не знал. Его жизнь была полна обычных забот о школе и борьбе за место под солнцем в доме, который никогда не называл своим домом. В тот утренний зимний день Гарри Поттер не подозревал, что скоро его жизнь кардинально изменится и он окажется в мире загадок и магии, где каждый угол и каждая тропинка скрывает истории и приключения, которые ждут своего часа, чтобы развернуться на полную катушку. Впрочем, всё это было впереди, а пока что он старался вытерпеть грядущий день, минуту за минутой. --- Это лишь незначительный кусочек вселенной, который дает вам представление о начальных этапах жизни Гарри и стиль, в котором мог бы быть написан подобный фанфик.

Если предположить, что каждая глава будет содержать примерно 2,000 слов (что тоже довольно много), то на 1 миллион символов потребуется около 500 глав.

Этот лучик каждое утро первым приветствовал Гарри, приглашая его в новый день полный однообразных дел и вечных ожиданий чего-то неопределенного. Мальчик проснулся от тихого звука, доносившегося издали, словно кто-то легко стучал по стеклу. Гарри прислушался, но звук не повторился. Возможно, это была ветка дерева, которая каждое утро напоминала ему, что она тоже здесь, рядом, борется за свое место в мире, точно так же как и он. Поднявшись с кровати, Гарри оглядел маленькую комнату. Все было как всегда: повсюду странно уютный беспорядок, старая книга с разрисованными краями лежала там, где он остался с ней вчера. Гарри подобрал её — книги были его билетом в мир тайн и приключений, где он был не просто мальчиком под лестницей, но героем всех своих историй. Одеться, пройти по тихому дому, приготовить завтрак на своей тихой кухне, принести его тем, кто не оценил его трудов — все это было повседневной рутиной. Но сегодня, впервые за долгое время, Гарри было не до негодования. Сегодня он хотел только одного — вернуться к своей книге. Пока он незаметно занял свое место за столом и стал есть свой самый невкусный тост, в его голове роились мысли об очередных приключениях. Ему казалось, что даже стены дома подыгрывают ему, шепча о загадочных мирах за пределами Привет Драйв. Завтрак закончился неожиданно скоро. Гарри, уже полный решимости вновь уйти в своё уединение, собирал посуду, как вдруг уловил нечто странное в воздухе — острый и холодный запах, который он никогда прежде не чувствовал. Сердце его забилось быстрее, и он повернулся к окну. И там, на подоконнике, стоял черный кот с ярко-желтыми глазами, смотревший прямо на него. Животные, как известно, не могут говорить, но взгляд этого кота казался невероятно осмысленным. Гарри шагнул вперед, но кот бесшумно скользнул за стекло и растворился в утреннем тумане. С этого момента день Гарри больше не казался таким обыденным. И в его сердце появилась надежда, что в его жизни настанут перемены, и он скоро узнает, что свет, исходящий из его снов, куда-то ведет, и что он не один. Но пока что книга и загадочный взгляд черного кота были его единственными союзниками в ожидании этого нового и захватывающего дня. Так закончился еще один утренний ритуал чудного начала, когда каждое новое утро начинается в точности как предыдущее, но всегда несет в себе семена нечто особенного. --- И вот так, Глава 1 завершилась, оставляя Гарри с теплым ощущением надвигающихся сюрпризов. Когда придет время для следующей главы, я буду готов продолжить его историю."},{"prompt":"Не не то давай увеличь объём главы в два раза","completion":"# Глава 1: Тень на подоконнике Мирное дыхание утра наполняло комнатку под лестницей Привет Драйв, номер четыре, где мешавшиеся лучи света едва доставали до пола, покрытого старыми игрушками и книгами. Под листами старого пледа, слегка подёргивающимися при каждом вдохе, лежал мальчик с молниеобразным шрамом на лбу, погруженный в беспокойный сон. Гарри порой мысленно вырывался за пределы своего тесного подвала, стремясь обрести снова и снова ту свободу, что оставалась только в его мечтах. Он видел себя мчащимся по просторам волшебного мира, о котором так много читал – мире, где он, мог быть кем угодно, кроме мальчика из чулана. Шорохи дома будили его медленно. Сегодня Дурслям было труднее, чем обычно, снова и снова призывать Гарри из пучины сна. Взгляд его блуждал между страниц последней прочитанной книги и окном, за которым он иногда ловил мелькание жизни неразгаданных тайн. — Гарри! Тебе снова не слышно? Сколько можно! — раздался голос тети Петуньи сквозь дверной проем. — Иди уже готовь завтрак! Гарри торопливо натянул старую футболку Дадли и потертые джинсы, отправившись на кухню выполнить очередное утреннее поручение. Размеренные движения, запах омлета на сковороде, звук кипящего чайника — ритуалы, предшествующие очередному дню в школе среди обычных детей с обычными семьями. В то время как он механически готовил завтрак, в голове прокручивались сцены из книги, прочитанной на ночь; магические ингредиенты смешивались в котлах, превращаясь в зелья неизвестного действия, а заклинания на языке, который никто из его одноклассников и подумать не мог выучить, оживали между обыденных объектов его скучной жизни. С каждым завтраком, Гарри убеждал себя, что скоро произойдёт что-то удивительное – что-то, что обязательно сотрёт серость его повседневности. Петунья нахмурилась, окинув взглядом завтрак, но не произнесла ни слова — это был признак того, что все в порядке. Гарри отошел в сторону, ожидая, когда они закончат, чтобы убрать за ними. Неожиданно, прямо за стеклом, появилась тень. Тень крупного кота, следившего за происходящим в доме с необъяснимым вниманием. Глаза его сверкали золотым светом, пробивая тусклое освещение кухни. Взгляд животного был удивительно проникновенным, и Гарри на мгновение забыл о недосказанных словах тети, о бесконечных требованиях и об унылости его жизни. Кот мог бы быть просто котом, но что-то в его постуре и манере следить за домом казалось странным. Мальчик шагнул к окну, но тот, как только обнаружил движение, скользнул в сторону и исчез из виду. Гарри вдруг захотелось выйти наружу, проверить, не остался ли кот поблизости, может быть, он был потерянным или искал себе новый дом? Но время не ждало, и тетя Петунья уже раздала новые распоряжения. С этими мыслями и новым удивлением в душе Гарри закончил утренние дела. Сегодня в школе он уж точно мечтал о волшебных приключениях. Как только дом освободился от жителей, мальчик отправился в школу, но его мысли постоянно возвращались к затаившейся тени того кота, оставившего столь внезапный и таинственный след в его утре. Отголоски детских грёз всё ещё звучали в его ушах, и, покидая двери Привет Драйв, он знал одно — жизнь полна неожиданных моментов, и этот день мог стать началом чего-то волшебного."},{"prompt":"О'кей допустим давай без кота пожалуйста давай вообще ничего такого давай какую-то прям грустную атмосферу но чтобы гарри не считал что это грустная атмосфера не надо это прямо описывать вот это вот гарри был таким грустным таким короче","completion":"# Глава 1: Тени прошедшего дня Тяжелый серый рассвет проникал в комнату под лестницей с неохотой, как старый учитель, с усталостью заставляющий себя начать утрок. Комнатка казалась особенно сумрачной в эти зимние утренние часы, когда свет скуп и бессильный против длинных ночных теней. На маленькой кровати, закутанный в изношенное одеяло, лежал мальчик, чьи тяжелые медленные вздохи не менялись вне зависимости от снов, что теснили его разум. Гарри Поттер, чьё лицо отражало неговорящую покорность, спал, не обращая внимания на прошлую ночь, полную тревожных грез. Старый пол в комнатке был покрыт тяжелыми трещинами, а паутина в углах была напоминанием о том, что ни детство, ни это маленькое пространство не хранили в себе радостей или постоянства. Все что оставалось — это шрам на его лбу, как молчаливый свидетель прошлых лет и трагедий, потускневших в его памяти. Когда нависший молчок дома внезапно прервался резким скрипом двери, Гарри чуть заметно сжался. Его тетя, Петунья Дурсль, как обычно, без колебаний ворвалась в маленькое пространство его одиночества. — Давай, скорее вставай. У тебя есть обязанности, которые ты должен выполнить до школы, — прозвучал её строгий голос. Гарри отважно поднял веки, встречая серый свет утра, и откинул плед. Его движения были полны автоматизма, натренированные долгими годами. Тихо поднявшись, он протянулся к старинной комодной дверце, вытягивая свою форму — копию одежды кузена, переданную по износу, не по размеру. Прохлада кухни встретила его неприязнью, которую Гарри замечал едва лишь в полуосознанном состоянии. Скорее всего, каждое утро начиналось с привычки, что рутина никогда не была невыносимой, а просто чьим-то удалённым, холодным отзвуком. Его руки, обветренные жизнью больше, чем могли бы быть у мальчика его возраста, разогревали сковороду и разбивали яйца. Звуки приготовления завтрака были скорее мелодией привычек, чем признаками нового дня. Семья Дурсль села за стол сразу после того, как Гарри подал свежего хлеба. Сидеть рядом с ними, наблюдая, как они едят приготовленное им обеденное блюдо, было частью его молчаливого существования. Невеселый гул разговоров об опозданиях, о работе, о школьных успехах Дадли. Гарри слушал их не вникая в суть, его мир был где-то далеко оттуда. Оставшись один с мытем посуды, Гарри позволил себе краткий момент погрузиться в мысли. Его реальность не нуждалась в сожалениях, она состояла из моментов выжидания, из нитей надежды, которую он ткёт каждый день, мечтая, что найдёт место, где его прошлое и будущее будут иметь значение. Школьные часы скользили мимо Боявшийся занятий как таковых он не был. Была лишь монотонность, был лишь предсказуемый ритм одинаковых уроков и перерывов, пока не прозвенит последний звонок, освобождающий его ненадолго, чтобы вновь вернуться в тень номера четыре. Гарри не ожидал перемен. Он просто существовал, и каждый новый день и урок находил его подготовленным к обыденности, не заметной для наблюдателей, как голоса эхом отдаются от этих четырех стен. Тихий голос дня растворялся в сумраке, оставляя его одного с полумраком своей комнаты под лестницей, когда грусть становилась слишком ощутимой, чтобы игнорировать. Но Гарри никогда не давал ей овладеть собой, продолжая предаваться мечтам, даря себе мир, где печаль — всего лишь временная тень."},{"prompt":"Is there a more recent fork of iotop ?","completion":"As of my knowledge, the latest fork of iotop is \\"guiotop\\" which was created in 2018.

Ниже приведен пример того, как это можно сделать: 1. У вас должна быть отдельная сцена загрузки (например, назовем ее \\"LoadingScene\\"), в которой будет просто черный экран или любой другой дизайн загрузочного экрана. 2. В сцене загрузки создайте скрипт, который будет отвечать за асинхронную загрузку нужных сцен. Пример скрипта на C#, который можно прикрепить к GameObject в LoadingScene: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; using System.Collections; public class Loader : MonoBehaviour { // Преференции сцен, которые нужно загрузить private string mainSceneName = \\"MainScene\\"; private string additionalSceneName = \\"AdditionalScene\\"; void Start() { // Начать процесс загрузки главной сцены StartCoroutine(LoadSceneAsync(mainSceneName)); // Вы также можете начать загрузку другой сцены параллельно, если требуется // StartCoroutine(LoadSceneAsync(additionalSceneName)); } // Корутина загрузки сцен асинхронно IEnumerator LoadSceneAsync(string sceneName) { AsyncOperation asyncLoad = SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync(sceneName); // Запретите переход к следующей сцене до тех пор, пока не будет дана команда asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = false; // Ожидайте, пока сцена загружается while (!asyncLoad.isDone) { // Здесь можно обновлять интерфейс пользователя, чтобы показать прогресс загрузки, например: // progressBar.fillAmount = asyncLoad.progress; // Условие перехода к следующей сцене (например, когда загрузка достигла 90%) if (asyncLoad.progress >= 0.9f) { // Возможно, вы хотите добавить задержку или пользовательское действие (нажатие на кнопку) перед активацией сцены asyncLoad.allowSceneActivation = true; // Разрешить активацию сцены и завершение загрузки } yield return null; } } } \`\`\` 3. Менеджер сцен, включенный в Unity, управляет сценами. Опция \`allowSceneActivation\` управляет моментом, когда сцена становится активной после загрузки. Если вы хотите задержать момент активации, вы можете сначала загрузить сцену, не активируя ее сразу, дождаться подходящего момента (например, нажатия пользователя на кнопку), а затем активировать ее. 4. Чтобы пользователи ощущали сцену загрузки без задержек, основной процесс не должен быть слишком сложным. Следите за тем, чтобы в сцене загрузки не было ресурсоемких операций. 5. По завершении загрузки и при выполнении условия (в примере это достижение 90% прогресса загрузки) сцена становится активной. Обратите внимание, что вам следует настроить свой проект, чтобы сцены, которые вы собираетесь загрузить, были включены в список сцен в Build Settings (Файл > Build Settings... > Добавить Open Scenes). Этот процесс может быть скорректирован в соответствии с вашими специфическими нуждами, например, добавлением настроек интерфейса, таких как информация о загрузке или полосы прогресса."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, while looking like she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for presumably feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them. Then, the returning woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nasty sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she's physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"INT. SINGH FAMILY HOME - ENTRYWAY - DAY We are inside the Singh family home, a cozy and well-lived-in place, with family photographs decorating the walls. Sunlight filters through the sheer curtains, casting a warm glow over the quiet scene. CUT TO: EXT. SINGH FAMILY HOME - DAY KAVYA (20s, college student, with a spirited face, eyes betraying both intelligence and mischief, her hair tied in a practical ponytail) hurries towards the front door of the Singh family home. She's wearing a traditional Indian salwar kameez, the colorful fabric fluttering with her every urgent step. A visible dance of unease plays across her features; her body language screams desperation. She reaches the front door and pats her pockets, her expression transitioning to panic when she doesn't find her keys. She begins to frantically knock on the door, shifting her weight from foot to foot. KAVYA (Muttering) Aaj nahi... please, abhi nahi... She rings the bell repeatedly, desperation clear in her actions. INTERCUT BETWEEN KAVYA OUTSIDE AND ENTRYWAY INSIDE Inside, SHAILA (late 40s, Kavya's mother, with an air of timeless grace and laugh lines that speak of a life well-enjoyed), stirs from her nap on the living room couch. Disoriented, she blinks slowly, her sari slightly crumpled from sleep. SHAILA (Rubbing eyes) Kaun hai baba? Kitna shor macha rakha hai? Shaila makes her way to the door, yawning and stretching. Kavya outside is hopping from one foot to the other, her knocking now accompanied by a barely-restrained squeal of distress. KAVYA (Holding herself, softly pleading) Jaldi karo, Ma! Please, please... Shaila takes her sweet time, fumbling with the locks and bolts, her movements slow and languid post-nap. KAVYA (Frantic, almost in tears) Mummy, please, bhaiya toh nahi hai? Jaldi kholo! Finally, the door swings open. Kavya attempts to dart past her mother, but Shaila, half-concerned, half-groggy, inadvertently blocks the entryway. SHAILA (Affectionate concern) Arre Kavya! Kya hua? Tum theek toh ho? Kavya, eyes wide with desperation, tries to wiggle free from her mother's light embrace. KAVYA (Breathlessly) Bas side ho jao, Ma... mujhe bahut urgent jaana hai... Before she can escape, Shaila's concern compels her to tighten her grip, inadvertently squeezing Kavya's stomach. KAVYA (Groans) Ma... nahi... Kavya freezes; her face contorts with involuntary relief, a soft moan escapes her lips as she involuntarily begins to relieve herself. Kavya's expression is a mix of shock, horror, and bizarre satisfaction as she experiences the untimely surrender. Shaila, confused, continues to inquire, unable to process the situation. SHAILA (Baffled) Kavya, tu toh ajeeb behave kar rahi hai... Kuchh toh bol! Kavya, still mid-crisis, manages only strained, muffled noises, her faculties focused on the task at hand. With each grunt, there's a guilty relief that floods her. KAVYA (Whispering between strains) Ma... smell... Shaila finally picks up on the aberrant situation, her nose crinkling as the odor invades her senses. SHAILA (Disgusted realization) Baba re baba! Kavya, tu... tu ne kya kar diya? Kavya avoids eye contact, her cheeks flushed with shame. She tries to sidestep her mother, with an awkward stance. KAVYA (Urgently) Bas ab andar jaane do, Ma... Shaila steps back, visibly grappling with revulsion, and Kavya waddles past her, cupping the seat of her pants. SHAILA (Scolding, mouth covered) Chee, ye kya kiya tune? Ghar ke bahar khadi itni der se kya raha rahi thi? Bachi hai kya tu? Kavya's initial shame morphs into sheepish indignation, her voice laced with embarrassed humor. KAVYA (Mischievously sulking) Tumne rasta rok diya na, Ma... and pet pe bhi dabao daala. SHAILA (Incredulous chuckle) Aisa bahana chalega? Teri umar mein? Aur khadi khadi puri... Woh bhi itne maze se? The scolding continues as Kavya inches toward the bathroom, but Shaila isn't done. She grabs Kavya gently but firmly, turning her around to face a rear examination. SHAILA (Examining, non-witty scolding) Arey! Kitna... Dekho toh, kya haalat banayi hai khud ki... ye kya tariqa hai? Kavya glances back coyly, still trapped in her awkward situation.

Shaila leans in, almost as if dissecting the situation, and scrunches her face in a gesture of mocked disgust. SHAILA (Mockingly scolding) Haan, zaroor jana chahiye, tu toh haalat kar di hai... Kya baas aa rahi hai! Kavya takes a self-conscious sniff, grimaces at her own scent, and tries to reclaim some dignity with a dash of playful defiance. KAVYA (Evenly, with a playful touch) Toh bhaatijiye na, aakhir tumhare kaaran hi toh... The appalling stench still hanging in the air, Shaila waves her daughter off. SHAILA (Cringing) Chal, chal, bathroom ja. Naha leke, kapde badal le... Bhagwan jaane kaise bardasht kiya tune itna time. Kavya, maintaining her poise in spite of the circumstances, begins to waddle off towards the bathroom, her hands still awkwardly placed. Shaila is left shaking her head as the scene fades out.

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, while looking like she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for presumably feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them. Then, the returning woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, insisting that she has to go to clean up the due to the nastiness of the sensation of the voluminous deposit in her pants, which she describes in some detail. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she's physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"**INT.

A look of pure horror spreads across her face as she realizes that her keys are nowhere to be found. **JAMILA:** (panic-stricken, muttering) Oh no, no, no... this can't be happening. Jamila starts knocking on the door. Her raps quickly turn into frenzied bangs. **JAMILA:** (shouting) Mom! Open up, it's Jamila! From the other side of the door, a groggy voice emerges. NOURA, mid-40s, with expressive eyes that speak volumes of her nurturing soul, is the voice's owner; her attire speaks volumes of her no-nonsense personality mingled with cultural touches - a simple yet elegant embroidered caftan. **NOURA:** (disoriented) Jamila? What's all this noise? Is everything okay? **JAMILA:** (Tension rising) Yeah, Mom, just... please hurry up! The LOCKS CLICK and TUMBLE; every second feels like eternity to Jamila. The door finally opens to reveal Noura rubbing her eyes and yawning, unaware of the pressing crisis. **NOURA:** (still half-asleep) What's the rush? Are you runni— Before Noura can finish, Jamila tries to dart past her, but Noura reflexively reaches out, alarmed by her daughter's panic. **NOURA:** (concerned, holding Jamila) Jamila, what's wrong? Talk to me! **JAMILA:** (pleading desperately) Mom, please, just move! Jamila struggles against Noura's grip, but in doing so, Noura inadvertently squeezes Jamila’s stomach. A look of acute distress flashes across Jamila's face as her self-control wanes. **JAMILA:** (straining, embarrassed) Oh, God... **NOURA:** (increasingly worried) Jamila, what's happening? Are you in pain? Talk to me! Noura is met by Jamila's pained expression of relief, accompanied by a hushed yet strained reply, barely above a whisper, intermixed with gentle grunts of exertion. **JAMILA:** (with quiet intensity) It's... it’s okay... I'll be...fine... The informed silence is then shattered by the subtle sounds of fabric contending with an unwelcome substance, the room beginning to bear an increasingly noticeable smell. Noura's nose twitches, and her expression contorts as realization dawns. **NOURA:** (putting the pieces together) Jamila... did you just...? Jamila finally speaks up, her voice a cocktail of sheepishness, desperation, and subtle sulking. **JAMILA:** Can we not right now? Just let me in, please. Noura steps aside, her senses besieged by the malodorous intrusion. Jamila maneuvers past her, a hand gingerly cupping the seat of her pants, maintaining what little dignity she can muster. **NOURA:** (disbelievingly scolding) Jamila! Such a big, smelly mess? What in the world! **JAMILA:** (indignant yet embarrassed) Well, maybe if someone didn’t squeeze me like a toothpaste tube— Noura shakes her head, her tone oscillating between taunting and incredulous scolding. **NOURA:** That's no excuse for a grown-up, and under no circumstances should you have felt good filling up your pants like that! Jamila, teetering on frustration and reluctant amusement, retorts. **JAMILA:** I didn't feel 'good'. I just—(wincing as she feels the seat of her pants) It's just, it was coming out one way or the other, okay? Noura halts Jamila's bathroom-bound escape, inspecting the damage with a mix of disbelief and motherly disdain. **NOURA:** (turning Jamila around, scrutinizing) I can't believe this—look at you! Jamila lets out a huffy breath, squirming in discomfort. **JAMILA:** Yeah, yeah, I get it. Nasty, big mess. Can I go clean up now? Noura sniffs pointedly near Jamila and recoils. **NOURA:** No argument here; you need a shower, stat. You reek! Jamila, unable to escape the pungent reality, reluctantly agrees. **JAMILA:** (smirking despite herself) Guess you better get used to it, 'cause you kinda had a hand—or a squeeze—in it. Noura, grimacing dramatically, finally ushers her daughter away. **NOURA:** Off you go, stinky. And we're never speaking of this again. Jamila, waddling toward salvation, throws back one last playful jibe. **JAMILA:** (over her shoulder) Oh, we’re talking about it... in therapy! CUT TO: Noura watching her daughter retreat, one hand pinching her nose, the other waving Jamila away as laughter and disbelief mingle in her relief-laden exhale.

He finds the \\"monster\\" scary and has a nightmare about it. Eventually, his parents come and comfort him by saying that monsters aren't real, and he made the threat of the \\"monster\\" up in his head. Fast forward to the present, where an adult Nick Wilde comes across the same shed, and enters it -- only to discover that the \\"monster\\" was just a broomstick.","completion":"In the bustling, vibrant world of Zootopia, young Nicholas Piberius “Nick” Wilde fancied himself quite the adventurer. With fur as red as the setting sun and a grin that suggested he knew something you didn't, he was the epitome of foxy cunning. So, when the whispers of a haunted shed on the edge of the Bunnyburrows began to circulate among the local kits, Nick couldn’t resist the thrill of the dare. One fateful night, under the umbrella of twinkling stars, young Nick found his little heart drumming a samba against his ribcage as he slipped away from his cozy bed to explore the mysterious shed. Armed only with a paw-made flashlight that flickered like the courage in his chest, he tiptoed through the dewy grass, whiskers twitching at the unknown. As he approached the shed, its aged wood creaked ominously while the wind played a haunting tune through the cracks. The door, barely hanging onto its hinges, whispered secrets of the dark as Nick nudged it open. The beam of his shaky flashlight danced across the room like an anxious ballet dancer, searching for horrors. And then he saw it—a towering monster covered in fur from top to bottom, with a crooked back topped with what seemed to be an unruly mess of hair, and eyes that glinted from within the shadows. Nick’s tail puffed out, his fur stood on end, and his juvenile scream scaled the octaves as he bolted back home faster than Cheetah in the 100-yard dash. Safe under his covers, his imagination ran wild. He envisioned the monster slipping through the window, giant and terrifying, with a broom-like head and a dustpan for a maw. Nick’s small fox form shook like a leaf until his parents, hearing the commotion, padded into the room with worried looks. “What’s the matter, Nicky?” his mother asked while his father scanned the room for threats. Nick gulped down his fear. “The shed! I saw a monster!” he exclaimed, much to the bemusement of his parents. With both patience and love, his parents comforted him through the night, assuring him that monsters were just stories, figments of the imagination to add spice to the mundane. Eventually, pressed against his mother’s soft side and his father’s sturdy frame, the young fox found sleep. Years later, now Officer Nick Wilde of the Zootopia Police Department, with the wisdom of an adult and the experience of a seasoned partnership with Judy Hopps, stumbled upon the same old shed while on patrol. The stories of his childhood, though tucked away with other kiddish thoughts, couldn't help but leap to the forefront of his mind. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he muttered to himself, a smirk tugging at his lips. With a confident stride, he marched up to the shed and threw the door open with a flourish, expecting nothing more than a home for forgotten garden tools. Inside, standing exactly where the “monster” had been all those years ago, was... a broomstick. The \\"eyes\\" were simply knots in the wood reflecting the stray light, its \\"fur\\" was an old feather duster rising like a crest atop its handle, its \\"back\\" was an awkwardly angled rake that had slumped against the wall. Nick burst out laughing, his chuckles echoing through the clearing. As the laugh lines deepened around his emerald eyes, he shook his head, realizing how imaginations could transform mundane objects into whispers of midnight folklore. Strolling back to his police cruiser, where Officer Hopps waited, tapping her foot with mock impatience, Nick decided that the “monster shed” tale might just make the perfect story to share with the crew back at the precinct—after all, who wouldn’t want to hear about the infamous Broomstick Beast of Bunnyburrows?"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Напиши максимально подробно","completion":"Предварительная и окончательная термообработка порошков на никелевой основе является важным процессом для достижения нужных свойств и структур материала. Процесс проводится в несколько этапов, который можно описать следующим образом: Предварительная термообработка: 1. Сушка: В начале процесса порошки на никелевой основе должны быть полностью высушены, чтобы удалить влагу и другие легкие загрязнения. Это позволяет избежать преждевременного окисления и обеспечить равномерное проникновение тепла в материал. Сушку можно выполнить при температуре около 100-120 градусов Цельсия в течение нескольких часов. 2. Предварительный нагрев: Затем порошки на никелевой основе подвергаются предварительному нагреву для удаления остаточной влаги и дальнейшего равномерного прогрева. Этот этап выполняется при температуре примерно 500-600 градусов Цельсия и продолжается в течение нескольких часов. Предварительный нагрев может быть осуществлен в печи или поковке. Окончательная термообработка: 3. Нагрев до рабочей температуры: После предварительного нагрева порошки на никелевой основе подвергают окончательной термообработке путем нагрева до рабочей температуры. Идеальная температура зависит от конкретного материала и требуемых свойств, но для порошков на никелевой основе обычно используются температуры в диапазоне 800-1200 градусов Цельсия. Эта стадия процесса обеспечивает необходимые механические, физические и химические свойства материала. 4. Продолжительность выдержки: После достижения рабочей температуры порошки на никелевой основе выдерживаются в течение определенного времени для обеспечения полного превращения структуры и образования нужных фаз. Время выдержки также может варьироваться в зависимости от конкретных требований материала, но обычно составляет несколько часов. 5. Охлаждение: После окончания этапа нагрева и выдержки порошки на никелевой основе охлаждаются до комнатной температуры. Это может быть достигнуто естественным охлаждением или с помощью контролируемых охладительных систем. Важно отметить, что конкретные параметры термообработки порошков на никелевой основе могут различаться в зависимости от конкретного материала, требуемых свойств и процесса производства. Поэтому для оптимальных результатов рекомендуется обратиться к специалистам или конкретным руководствам по термообработке для конкретного материала."},{"prompt":"напиши источник информации","completion":"Приношу извинения, но я, в качестве искусственного интеллекта, не имею прямого доступа к конкретным источникам информации.

Created by Peter J. Hammond, the series centred on two interdimensional operatives, Sapphire (played by Joanna Lumley) and Steel (played by David McCallum). They were tasked with protecting the structure of time from various threats and anomalies. In the universe of \\"Sapphire & Steel,\\" the two title characters are part of a larger group of elements that each have different operatives possessing unique abilities. These elements are not fully explained, and viewers are not provided with a comprehensive list of all the entities or operatives. However, other entities mentioned or seen throughout the series include: 1. **Lead** - In Assignment Five (sometimes referred to as \\"The Man Without a Face\\"), Lead is another operative who assists Sapphire and Steel. He is portrayed as being strong and somewhat less sensitive than the other two operatives, with a protective nature, particularly against supernatural cold or malevolent ghosts. 2. **Silver** - Appearing in Assignments Two and Six, Silver is a technician and has the ability to manipulate and repair metal objects and machinery. He is presented as more light-hearted than the main duo, and he seems to have a good working relationship with Sapphire and Steel. 3. **Jet, Mercury, Gold, Copper, and Diamond** - These characters are mentioned but not seen in the series. Very little is known about them, including their special abilities or roles within the structure of the operative system. The series does not expand upon the larger cosmology or how these entities are organized beyond the few details presented during the episodes. However, the implication is that they are organized in a way akin to a celestial bureaucracy, each with their own roles in maintaining the integrity of time in the face of various paranormal or temporal dangers. \\"Sapphire & Steel\\" builds its mystique by keeping much of the background of its characters and their world deliberately obscure, adding to the show's atmosphere of eerie enigma and supernatural intrigue. The series is well-regarded for its blend of science fiction and horror elements and for being unusually atmospheric and cerebral for television of its time."},{"prompt":"\\"Diamond\\" sounds older, and more hard-faced than Sapphire ;)","completion":"Your comment plays on the notion that \\"Diamond,\\" should the character have been introduced or explored within the \\"Sapphire & Steel\\" universe, might be considered as having traits akin to what their name implies—much like how Sapphire and Steel have personality traits and abilities that seem to align with the properties associated with their names (Sapphire being perceptive and analytical, Steel being strong and resolute). Diamonds, known as the hardest naturally occurring material, might suggest a character that is incredibly resilient, unyielding, and perhaps emotionally distant or severe—hence the description \\"older, and more hard-faced.\\" This kind of playful extrapolation is something that fans of the series might indulge in, considering the show's creators left much to the audience's imagination by not fully fleshing out the backstories or characteristics of the broader range of operatives within the show's lore. However, since \\"Diamond\\" was not featured in any episodes, any attributes ascribed to this hypothetical character are purely speculative and part of the fun that fans can have with the enigmatic nature of the series."},{"prompt":"What are two hypothetical 'agent' names, not mentioned?","completion":"In the spirit of the \\"Sapphire & Steel\\" universe, where the agents are named after materials with distinctive properties, we could create additional hypothetical agent names that fit the show's thematic naming convention. Here are two fictional names and their potential attributes: 1. **Agent Titanium** - Titanium is a strong, corrosion-resistant metal with a silver color. An agent named Titanium could be characterized by their exceptional resilience and durability. They might be a specialist in situations that require strength under pressure and a capacity to withstand extreme conditions without succumbing to damage. 2. **Agent Quartz** - Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silicon and oxygen atoms. An agent named Quartz might have abilities that relate to clarity, precision, or amplification of energy. This agent could have a role that involves seeing through deceptions, providing insightful analysis, or enhancing the abilities of others. These hypothetical agent names follow the show's pattern of assigning names that reflect unique qualities, which in turn suggest the agents' roles or powers within their mission to protect the integrity of time."},{"prompt":"Given David McAllum's acting range, would he have been a good choice for \\"The Doctor\\" in Doctor Who?","completion":"David McCallum is a talented and versatile actor, widely recognized for his roles in television series like \\"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\\" and \\"NCIS.\\" His acting range certainly suggests that he could have been an interesting choice for the role of \\"The Doctor\\" in \\"Doctor Who.\\" \\"The Doctor\\" is a character that requires a great deal of range, as the character has been portrayed with varying degrees of eccentricity, gravitas, compassion, intelligence, and whimsy over the years. McCallum's performances in various roles have demonstrated his capacity for both drama and light-heartedness, as well as his ability to handle complex and enigmatic characters, such as the role of Steel in \\"Sapphire & Steel.\\" It is often noted that actors who take on \\"The Doctor\\" bring their own unique flavor to the character, and there is no doubt that McCallum could have offered his distinctive presence to the role. The hypothetical match of McCallum's capabilities with the traits associated with \\"The Doctor\\" might have resulted in a portrayal that was both charming and authoritative, with a touch of the mysteriousness that he brought to the role of Steel. While we can only speculate about what kind of Doctor David McCallum might have been, his acting credentials suggest that he would have been a compelling and capable choice. However, the casting of \\"The Doctor\\" also depends on various factors beyond acting range, including timing, the vision of the show's producers, and the actor's career choices and availability. Ultimately, though, it's fun to ponder the \\"what ifs\\" of casting, especially when it involves a role as iconic as \\"The Doctor\\" in \\"Doctor Who.\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Если у нас есть данные о моменте силы ( tau ) и мы можем измерить угловое ускорение ( alpha ), тогда можно перестроить второй закон Ньютона в форме зависимости приложенного момента силы от углового ускорения: [ tau = I alpha + tau_{фр} ] Это уравнение представляет собой уравнение прямой в координатах (tau - alpha), где: - угловой коэффициент (наклон) прямой равен моменту инерции ( I ), - пересечение прямой с осью ординат (момент силы при нулевом угловом ускорении) даёт момент силы трения ( tau_{фр} ). Таким образом, чтобы найти момент силы трения ( tau_{фр} ) по графику, понадобится найти точку пересечения с осью ( tau ) (ординат) при угловом ускорении ( alpha = 0 ). Это значение и будет моментом силы трения. Если же в условии говорится, что есть график зависимости момента инерции от углового ускорения без учёта момента силы, тогда такой график не может напрямую дать момент силы трения, поскольку на графике будет изображена только зависимость связи момента инерции и углового ускорения. В таком случае потребуются дополнительные данные, такие как значения приложенного момента силы при различных угловых ускорениях, чтобы использовать уравнение вращательного движения для определения момента силы трения."},{"prompt":"Напишите программу для вычисления значения функции F(n), где n – натуральное число, задана следующими соотношениями: F(1) = 3 F(n) = F(n–1) * (n–1), при n >1 Пользователь вводит n, программа должна вывести значение F(n).На C","completion":"Вот пример программы на языке C, которая вычисляет значение функции F(n) по заданным соотношениям: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> // Функция для вычисления значения F(n) unsigned long long F(unsigned int n) { if (n == 1) { return 3; // Базовый случай } else { return F(n - 1) * (n - 1); // Рекурсивное соотношение } } int main() { unsigned int n; printf(\\"Введите натуральное число n: \\"); scanf(\\"%u\\", &n); // Считать n с клавиатуры // Вызов функции для вычисления F(n) и вывод результата printf(\\"Значение функции F(%u) равно %llun\\", n, F(n)); return 0; } \`\`\` В этой программе используется рекурсивная функция \`F\` для вычисления значения функции по заданной формуле.

Дело в том, что этот вектор передается по значению и не является ссылкой. Из-за этого внутренний вектор в классе \`PassGenCom\` — это копия исходного вектора и при этом она является локальной для конструируемого объекта. Изменения внутри \`PassGenCom\` не влияют на исходный вектор в функции \`main()\`. Чтобы это исправить, измените передачу \`passwords\` в конструкторе класса \`PassGenCom\` с передачи по значению на передачу по ссылке, чтобы все изменения в конструкторе и методе \`generate\` отражались на исходном векторе: Измените сигнатуру конструктора \`PassGenCom\` следующим образом: \`\`\`cpp PassGenCom(Fabric &f, int pass_count, vector<string> &p) : fabric(f), passwords_count(pass_count), passwords(p) {} \`\`\` Обратите внимание на \`vector<string> &p\`, который теперь передается по ссылке. Кроме того, существует еще несколько потенциальных ошибок или проблем с логикой в предоставленном коде: 1. В классе \`PassFabric\` используется функция \`rand()\` для генерации случайных чисел. Для более надежной и предсказуемой работы лучше использовать генераторы псевдослучайных чисел из стандартной библиотеки C++11, например, \`std::mt19937\` и \`std::uniform_int_distribution\`. 2. Функция \`randchar\` в \`PassFabric\` использует \`rand() % symbols.length()\`, что не гарантирует равномерное распределение символов, особенно если \`RAND_MAX + 1\` не является кратным \`symbols.length()\`. Нужно использовать \`std::uniform_int_distribution\` для правильного распределения. 3. Все вызовы \`Log::get_ekzempl().write()\` имеют одинаковое сообщение \\"Запущен процесс ввода параметров\\", что некорректно отображает фактические действия в программе. 4. В классе \`Program\` метод \`writePassOptions\` должен вернуть \`PassOptions\`, но из-за невозможности проверить \`Log\` и \`Log.cpp\`, возможны другие скрытые проблемы связанные с логированием. 5. В \`main\` функции, экземпляр \`program\` создается, но деструктор для него вызван не будет, так как программа завершится в \`while\` цикле при выборе \`loop = false\`. Это может быть не проблемой, если у \`Program\` нет деструктора с важной логикой очистки, но на практике это плохой паттерн. Исправьте эти проблемы и убедитесь, что ваш код корректно компилируется и выполняет требуемую логику. Если возникают проблемы с компонентами \`Log\` и \`Passgen\`, убедитесь, что они также корректно реализованы и интегрированы в вашу программу."},{"prompt":"Почему все вызовы Log::get_ekzempl().write() имеют одинаковое сообщение “Запущен процесс ввода параметров” ?","completion":"Из предоставленного вами кода видно, что вы вызываете метод \`Log::get_ekzempl().write()\` с одинаковым сообщением \\"Запущен процесс ввода параметров\\" в нескольких местах программы, включая различные этапы выполнения (например, при генерации пароля и проверке пароля на надежность).

The returning woman begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). The present woman was apparently napping inside the house this whole time. * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house's entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman's grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. * The returning woman reaches her limit. She attempts to force her way through the present woman's obstruction and into the house. When the returning woman attempts to force her way through, the resisting present woman inadvertently applies forceful pressure on the returning woman’s stomach and squeezes it. This causes the returning woman to lose control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she begins pooping her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). * The perplexed present woman is trying to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman is frozen in place in an awkward stance as she's concertedly pushing the contents of her bowels into her pants, moaning with exertion and pleasure as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman's behavior. The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained verbal reply indicating the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, hinting at the fact that the returning woman is going in her pants that very moment, and soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction, as the returning woman is still in the midst of relieving herself in her pants and savoring the release. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps the same result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief. Towards the end, the returning woman manages to strain a cryptic reply between grunts, ominously warning the present woman about an impending smell. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air and then react to the odor (describe this in elaborate detail). As this is occurring, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * It then dawns on the present woman what had just happened. With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The returning woman initially tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow the returning woman to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still physically reacting to the odor. * Following this exchange, the returning woman gingerly waddles into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman scolds her for having nastily pooped her pants (describe this in elaborate detail). The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for the way in which she childishly pooped her pants, and for the big, smelly mess that the returning woman made in her pants (describe in elaborate detail). * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman's fault because she blocked the returning woman’s path and pressed the returning woman’s stomach forcefully. * The present woman incredulously rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstances for a woman of the returning woman's age, and then she tauntingly scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and childishly finishing the whole bowel movement in her pants, while looking like she was enjoying making a smelly mess in her pants (describe this in detail). * The playfully disgruntled returning woman replies to the present woman's admonishment, insisting that she desperately had to move her bowels and that she was compelled to release because of the present woman's actions, even if it meant that she would have to release in her own pants. Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulk in the seat of her own pants with her hand while playfully wincing, then wryly remarks that it indeed felt relieving to finally release the deposit - even while making a smelly mess in her pants for the sake of that release - but that she should now head to the bathroom to clean up, and then attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up. However, she is subsequently apprehended by the present woman who mockingly tells the returning woman that the returning woman is nasty for presumably feeling good about releasing the deposit in her pants and making such a smelly mess in them. Then, the returning woman also demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s poop-filled pants because of her incredulous astonishment over the absurdity of the situation of the returning woman pooping her pants in such manner. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman successfully halts the returning woman who is on her way to the bathroom and delicately turns the returning woman around so she can observe her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman's observation of her rear end, wryly describing to the present woman how the voluminous deposit in her own pants and then remarking that the it seems as if the present woman wants to keep said voluminous deposit in the returning woman's pants, as she's withholding the returning woman from heading to clean up. * As she is observing the returning woman's rear end, the present woman sniffs close to the returning woman and mockingly reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a physical gesture, while also tauntingly agreeing with the returning woman that the returning woman certainly needs to go and clean up because the returning woman terribly stinks (describe this in elaborate detail; the present woman's taunting shouldn’t be sarcastically witty, it should be tauntingly scolding instead). * The returning woman sniffs the air, then as she's physically reacting to her own odor she wryly acknowledges the present woman's mocking of the returning woman's odor and remarks on how it indeed terribly stinks, but she goes on to playfully insist that the present woman mights as well enjoy it due to the present woman's actions having a significant contribution to this outcome (describe this in elaborate detail). * While still physically reacting to the odor, the cringing present woman ushers the returning woman off to the bathroom while telling the returning woman to clean up her stinky self. The returning woman waddles off as the present woman is still reacting to the odor.","completion":"Title: \\"Kapil Ka Kalesh\\" EXT.

(Translation: You're right, mom. It's very stinky... enjoy, it’s the fruit of your actions.) Meena still cringing, ushers Reena towards the bathroom with haste. MEENA (invigoratively) Ab ja... jaldi se clean kar apne aap ko. Pata nahi kya kya ho raha hai aajkal... (Translation: Now go... clean yourself up quickly. Don't know what all is happening these days...) Reena waddles off, Meena shakes her head and continues to react to the odor, clearly baffled but showing an undertone of comedic exasperation. As the scene ends, the absurdity of the situation blends with familial love and a humorous domestic blunder. The laughter of the audience mingles with Meena's tsking and Reena's embarrassed yet defiant exit.
