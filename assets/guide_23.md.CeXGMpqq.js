Ozone can only absorb UV-B radiation, while O2 absorbs both UV-A and UV-B. - B. O3 has a higher molar mass than O2, making it naturally thicker and thus a better barrier. - C. The molecular structure of O3 allows for the absorption of UV photons that break the ozone molecule apart, a process not effective in O2. - D. O2 is primarily found in the lower atmosphere, thus it does not come into contact with UV radiation. **Correct Answer:** C. The molecular structure of O3 allows for the absorption of UV photons that break the ozone molecule apart, a process not effective in O2. **Edge Case Option:** A. Ozone can only absorb UV-B radiation, while O2 absorbs both UV-A and UV-B. **Explanation:** The correct answer is C because ozone absorbs UV-B radiation through its unique molecular structure, which allows UV photons to split the molecule apart, a process known as photodissociation. This process does not apply to diatomic oxygen (O2) as effectively because its molecular bonds are not as easily broken by UV-B photons. Option A is an edge case and a sophisticated distractor because it incorrectly specifies the types of UV radiation absorbed by O2 and O3, challenging the test taker to know the specific absorption properties of these molecules. 2. **MCQ:** At what altitude range does the ozone layer primarily exist? - A. 0 – 10 km above Earth’s surface - B. 10 – 30 km above Earth’s surface - C. 30 – 50 km above Earth’s surface - D. 50 – 70 km above Earth’s surface **Correct Answer:** B. 10 – 30 km above Earth’s surface **Edge Case Option:** C. 30 – 50 km above Earth’s surface **Explanation:** The correct answer is B because the ozone layer is primarily situated in the stratosphere, approximately 10-30 km above Earth\'s surface, where it absorbs the majority of the sun\'s harmful ultraviolet radiation. Option C is an edge case because there is a common misconception about the ozone layer\'s altitude, with some sources mistakenly extending its reach higher into the stratosphere, testing the nuanced understanding of its location. 3. **MCQ:** Which process is primarily responsible for the natural formation of ozone (O3) in the Earth\'s atmosphere? - A. Photosynthesis by terrestrial plants - B. The photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by UV light followed by O2 reacting with atomic oxygen (O) - C. Combustion reactions in the troposphere - D. Lightning discharges in the atmosphere **Correct Answer:** B. The photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by UV light followed by O2 reacting with atomic oxygen (O) **Edge Case Option:** D. Lightning discharges in the atmosphere **Explanation:** The primary process for natural ozone formation is through the photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by ultraviolet (UV) light to create atomic oxygen (O), which then recombines with O2 to form ozone (O3). This process is correctly described in option B. Option D is an edge case because while lightning can produce ozone, it is not the primary natural source of atmospheric ozone. This option tests the understanding that ozone production can occur through different mechanisms but highlights the major process. 4. **MCQ:** Which factor most significantly contributes to the seasonal fluctuation of the ozone layer\'s thickness? - A. The angle of the sun’s rays - B. Variations in industrial pollution - C. The Earth\'s magnetic field variations - D. Changes in ocean currents **Correct Answer:** A. The angle of the sun’s rays **Edge Case Option:** B. Variations in industrial pollution **Explanation:** The thickness of the ozone layer fluctuates seasonally primarily due to the angle of the sun\'s rays, which impacts the intensity of UV radiation and consequently the rate of ozone formation and destruction in the atmosphere; thus, A is correct. While industrial pollution significantly impacts the ozone layer by contributing to its depletion, its influence as described in option B does not account for regular seasonal fluctuations, making it an edge case by challenging the distinction between long-term depletion and short-term seasonal variation. 5. **MCQ:** What outcome results from the interaction between chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone in the stratosphere? - A. Formation of additional ozone molecules - B. Conversion of CFCs into harmless water vapor - C. Destruction of ozone molecules and release of chlorine atoms - D. Stabilization of the ozone layer by reflecting UV rays back into space **Correct Answer:** C. Destruction of ozone molecules and release of chlorine atoms **Edge Case Option:** D. Stabilization of the ozone layer by reflecting UV rays back into space **Explanation:** The interaction between chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone in the stratosphere leads to the destruction of ozone molecules and the release of chlorine atoms (Option C), a process that significantly depletes the ozone layer. Option D serves as an edge case by presenting a plausible-sounding but incorrect scenario where CFCs would have a protective role rather than a harmful one, testing the depth of understanding regarding the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer."},{"prompt":"I want you to act as an expert in creating edge-case multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that challenge the understanding of complex concepts.

The density of stratospheric clouds. - B. The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere. - C. The global average temperature at sea level. - D. The concentration of industrial gases other than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). **Correct Answer:** B. The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere. **Edge Case Option:** A. The density of stratospheric clouds. **Explanation:** The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere is directly responsible for the photodissociation of molecular oxygen, which is the initial step in natural ozone regeneration, making B the correct answer. Option A is an edge case option because, while stratospheric clouds can influence the distribution and density of ozone by affecting temperature and thereby reaction rates, their role is not as direct or significant as the UV radiation itself in controlling the regeneration rate of ozone. 2. **MCQ:** In the context of ozone depletion, how do chlorine atoms (from CFCs) act differently from oxygen atoms (from O2) in the ozone-oxygen cycle in the stratosphere? - A. Chlorine atoms only interact with oxygen atoms, not ozone molecules. - B. Unlike oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms act as a catalyst in breaking down ozone without being consumed. - C. Chlorine atoms convert more efficiently to ozone under UV light than oxygen atoms. - D. Oxygen atoms enhance the stability of the ozone layer, unlike chlorine atoms. **Correct Answer:** B. Unlike oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms act as a catalyst in breaking down ozone without being consumed. **Edge Case Option:** A. Chlorine atoms only interact with oxygen atoms, not ozone molecules. **Explanation:** Chlorine atoms, released from CFCs, act as a catalyst in the chemical reactions that break down ozone molecules, without being consumed in the process, which explains why even small amounts of chlorine can have a large impact on ozone depletion, making B the correct choice. Option A is sophisticatedly incorrect and an edge case because it suggests a misleading specificity about the reactions involving chlorine atoms, testing the understanding that chlorine atoms actually react with ozone molecules directly, as well as with atomic oxygen resulting from those reactions. 3. **MCQ:** Why does the ozone layer thickness vary seasonally, with a maximum during the spring and fall at higher latitudes? - A. Increased industrial pollution during winter months. - B. Higher UV radiation levels in the spring and fall promote ozone creation. - C. The angle and intensity of sun exposure vary, affecting the rate of ozone formation and destruction. - D. Ozone is transported from lower latitudes to higher latitudes. **Correct Answer:** C. The angle and intensity of sun exposure vary, affecting the rate of ozone formation and destruction. **Edge Case Option:** D. Ozone is transported from lower latitudes to higher latitudes. **Explanation:** The seasonal variation in the thickness of the ozone layer, with peaks in spring and autumn, can be attributed to the complex interplay of the angle and intensity of sun exposure, which affects both the rates of ozone formation and its destruction. Option C accurately captures these dynamics. Option D is an edge case as it points toward a correct, but less direct, process where atmospheric circulation patterns can indeed transport ozone, thereby affecting its distribution, yet this process is not the primary reason for seasonal variation at high latitudes. 4. **MCQ:** What role does the temperature of the stratosphere play in the formation and depletion of the ozone layer? - A. Warmer temperatures increase the rate of ozone formation exponentially. - B. Colder temperatures facilitate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that play a role in ozone depletion. - C. There is no significant temperature effect on ozone chemistry. - D. Warmer temperatures directly decrease industrial emissions of ozone-depleting substances. **Correct Answer:** B. Colder temperatures facilitate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that play a role in ozone depletion. **Edge Case Option:** A. Warmer temperatures increase the rate of ozone formation exponentially. **Explanation:** Colder temperatures in the stratosphere lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, which provide a surface for chlorine and bromine-catalyzed reactions that deplete ozone, making B the correct answer. Option A represents an edge case that tests understanding of generic chemical reaction rates with temperature, which might seem applicable since many reaction rates increase with temperature. However, in the context of ozone chemistry, the specific catalyst-driven reactions on the surface of polar stratospheric clouds at colder temperatures are more directly relevant. 5. **MCQ:** Reflecting on the recovery of the ozone layer following the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which of the following statements is most accurate? - A. The ozone layer is expected to fully recover to pre-1980 levels by 2050 due to the complete cessation of all CFC emissions. - B. Ongoing global warming has accelerated the recovery of the ozone layer by increasing stratospheric temperatures. - C. Despite reduced CFC emissions, unexpected sources of ozone-depleting substances have been identified, potentially delaying recovery. - D. The Montreal Protocol only minimally impacted ozone recovery, as natural variations are the predominant factor in ozone layer thickness. **Correct Answer:** C. Despite reduced CFC emissions, unexpected sources of ozone-depleting substances have been identified, potentially delaying recovery. **Edge Case Option:** B. Ongoing global warming has accelerated the recovery of the ozone layer by increasing stratospheric temperatures. **Explanation:** The statement in C is correct, noting that while the Montreal Protocol significantly reduced emissions of many ozone-depleting substances, unexpected emissions of some of these substances have been detected in recent years, potentially complicating the recovery timeline. Option B presents an enticing misconstrual; while global warming affects many aspects of Earth\'s climate system, its direct role in accelerating the chemical recovery of the ozone layer is not supported by current scientific consensus, making it an effectively challenging edge case by invoking the complex interplay between global warming and ozone layer dynamics."},{"prompt":"Какие заинтересованные стороны в проекте по теме создание чат-бота для психологической помощи студентам","completion":"1.

This task typically involves filtering the reference field to display only relevant options based on the current user\'s location attribute. Here\'s a basic approach on how you might achieve this: # 1. Determine User Location First, you\'d ascertain the current user\'s location. This information could be stored in the User [sys_user] table or a related table, depending on your ServiceNow configuration. # 2. Filter Reference Field Options Next, you\'d use this location information to filter the options in your reference field. There are a few ways to do this, but one common method is to use a reference qualifier. Using a Reference Qualifier: - **Dynamic Reference Qualifier:** Create a Script Include that returns an encoded query based on the user\'s location. Then, set the reference qualifier of the reference field to use this Script Include. # Example Approach: Script Include (Server-side): Create a Script Include named `LocationBasedRefQual`: ```javascript var LocationBasedRefQual = Class.create(); LocationBasedRefQual.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, // Function to get encoded query based on user\'s location getQueryForUserLocation: function(userId) { var userLocation = \\"\\"; // Logic to get user location based on userId var query = \\"location=\\" + userLocation; // Modify to match your actual query return query; } }; ``` Update the `getQueryForUserLocation` method to correctly fetch the user\'s location and create an appropriate encoded query for the reference field. Client Script (Client-side): In some scenarios, you might need to manipulate the reference field options on the client side, especially if the filtering needs to be dynamic based on client-side interactions. ```javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === \'\') { return; } // Assuming \\"user_location_field\\" is the name of the Reference Field var userLocation = g_user.location; // Fetch current user location var refQual = \'location=\' + userLocation; // Modify your query accordingly g_form.getReference(\'user_location_field\', null).setAttribute(\'ref_qual_elements\', refQual); } ``` # Note: - The actual implementation may vary based on your specific ServiceNow version and configuration, including location attributes and how data is structured in your instance. - You may need to adjust the logic to fit your exact requirements, like fetching the user location and applying the correct query. - Test your scripts thoroughly in a sub-production instance before deploying them in your production environment to prevent any unexpected issues. This approach provides a flexible way to dynamically adjust Reference field options based on user attributes such as location, enhancing user experience and data relevance in your ServiceNow instance."},{"prompt":"give clear explanation","completion":"To dynamically remove options from a reference field in ServiceNow based on the user\'s location, we need to consider two primary steps. First is determining the user\'s location, and second is filtering the reference field options based on that location. For this task, we predominantly use scripting, and the implementation can slightly vary depending on your specific requirements and ServiceNow setup. # Step 1: Determine User Location In ServiceNow, every user has a profile in the User [sys_user] table, which can include location details if configured in your system. This location information is what you\'d use to filter reference field options. # Step 2: Filter Reference Field Options Using a Reference Qualifier A Reference Qualifier is used in ServiceNow to filter the entries presented in a reference field. You can create a dynamic reference qualifier by using a Script Include. A Script Include is a server-side script that allows you to write reusable JavaScript code. Script Include: 1. **Create a Script Include:** This Script Include will contain a function that generates an encoded query string based on the user\'s location. This query string is used to filter the options of your reference field. 2. **Example of a Script Include:** ```javascript var UserLocationFilter = Class.create(); UserLocationFilter.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, // Function to generate encoded query for reference field based on user\'s location getRefQual: function(userId) { var userGR = new GlideRecord(\'sys_user\'); if (userGR.get(userId)) { var userLocation = userGR.location; // Assuming you want to filter records having the same location as the user return \\"location=\\" + userLocation; } return \\"\\"; // return an empty string if no specific location is found }, type: \'UserLocationFilter\' }; ``` **Note:** You must replace `\\"location=\\" + userLocation` with the actual field and logic that matches your requirements. Reference Qualifier: For the reference field you wish to filter based on the user location, set the reference qualifier to use a dynamic filter. In the field\'s properties, you can specify to use a dynamic reference qualifier and call the Script Include you\'ve created. This is done in the reference field configuration in the ServiceNow table schema: - **Type:** Use Dynamic - **Script:** `new UserLocationFilter().getRefQual(gs.getUserID())` # Additional Considerations: - **Client-side Filtering:** If your use case requires filtering options based on client-side actions (e.g., changes to a form field without submitting the form), you might implement Client Scripts. However, since client scripts run on the user\'s browser, they don\'t directly modify server-side reference qualifiers but can manipulate which options are shown or hidden based on client-side logic. - **Testing:** Always test your implementation in a development or sandbox environment before deploying it in production to ensure it meets your needs and functions as expected across different scenarios. - **Documentation:** ServiceNow provides extensive documentation and community forums where developers share solutions. If you encounter specific issues, these resources can be very helpful. Remember, the exact implementation details can vary based on your ServiceNow setup and version. Always refer to the latest ServiceNow documentation for the most current practices and script APIs."},{"prompt":"We have the requirement of encrypt the users’s input when they reject a request and write a justification in the spModal from Employee Center Approval page, it’s possible to encrypt this justification as a password field, not encrypted in the db, it’s more like when you are typing the comment in the spModal that it’s displayed when a user is rejecting the request.","completion":"Encrypting user input in real-time within an `spModal` in the ServiceNow Employee Center (or Service Portal) as they type—similar to a password field hiding characters—does not directly relate to database encryption but more to UI behavior modification.

Customizing the `spModal` Instance When you create or customize an `spModal`, specify the input field for the justification as a password field. This is not standard functionality for a justification input (which would typically be a text area), so you would need to customize this part. ```javascript // Example of launching an spModal with a password field spModal.open({ title: \'Reject Justification\', message: \'Please enter your justification for rejection:\', inputType: \'password\', // Setting inputType to password to mask input buttons: [ {label: \'Submit\', value: true}, {label: \'Cancel\', value: false} ], callback: function(result) { // Callback function to handle the submission if (result) { var justification = result; // result contains the masked/encrypted justification // Proceed with any action after receiving the justification } } }); ``` # 2. Implementing the Solution Since this might not be straightforward for multi-line text areas (used commonly for justifications or comments), you would typically use a single-line input of type \\"password.\\" This limits the ability to review the full text easily, which might not be ideal for longer text but is suitable for masking the input. For longer justifications requiring multi-line inputs, there\'s no direct HTML input equivalent to a multiline `password` field. To simulate this, you would need a more complex JavaScript-based solution that captures input, masks it in the display, and perhaps mirrors the input into a hidden field for submission. However, such an approach can be complex and may impact user experience. # 3. Security Note Remember, the purpose of this masking is user interface level privacy and does not equate to encrypting the data for secure storage or transmission. You would need to ensure secure handling of the data post-submission according to your security requirements. # 4. Potential Limitations - **User Experience:** Masking the entire justification might not offer the best user experience, especially if the user wants to review what they\'ve typed before submitting. - **Functionality:** Standard multi-line comment or justification fields don’t support direct masking like password fields without custom coding. # Conclusion Masking input in an `spModal` in ServiceNow as described is feasible for single-line inputs by setting the input type to \\"password.\\" For a multi-line justification field, achieving a similar masking effect requires a more complex, custom JavaScript solution. Always consider the impact on user experience and the security implications of how data is handled after submission."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

，按照?后的参数顺序，从数组替换过去","completion":"Spring Framework中没有直接提插件或工具专门用于将字符串中的参数占位符（如`?2`，`?4`等）按照后面的数字顺序来从数组中替换。这种特定格式的字符串替换不是Spring的核心功能。Spring主要关注的是企业级应用的开发，包括但不限于数据库操作、事务管理、Web应用开发、安全性、消息服务等。 不过，实现这样的功能在Java中是相对直接的。若你的目标是实现这样的字符串替换功能，可以通过编写一个简单的方法来实现，下面是一个简单的示例： ```java public class StringReplaceExample { public static void main(String[] args) { String template = \\"This is ?2 test for ?4 mechanism ?1 example ?3.\\"; Object[] values = {\\"an\\", \\"a\\", \\"replacement\\", \\"simple\\"}; String result = replacePlaceholders(template, values); System.out.println(result); } public static String replacePlaceholders(String template, Object[] values) { // 正则表达式匹配形如 ?1, ?2, ... 的占位符 String regex = \\"?(d+)\\"; Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex); Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(template); StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer(); while (matcher.find()) { int index = Integer.parseInt(matcher.group(1)) - 1; // -1 因为占位符是从1开始的，但数组索引从0开始 // 检查索引是否越界，如果越界，保留原始字符串 String replacement = (index >= 0 && index < values.length) ? values[index].toString() : matcher.group(0); matcher.appendReplacement(result, replacement); } matcher.appendTail(result); return result.toString(); } } ``` 这段代码中，`replacePlaceholders`方法接受一个按照特定格式（如`?1`，`?2`等占位符）定义的模板字符串和一个包含替换值的数组，然后用这些值替换模板字符串中的占位符。使用Java的正则表达式（`Pattern`和`Matcher`类）来查找模板字符串中所有符合格式的占位符，并用对应的数组元素替换它们。需要注意的是，这个实现考虑了数组索引越界的情况，并保留了原有的占位符。 不过，如果你在处理数据库相关的操作，可能你看到的`?2`，`?4`这样的占位符是在JDBC的`PreparedStatement`中，那种情况下，这些占位符实际上是用于防止SQL注入，提供参数化查询的，而不是用于字符串替换的。在Spring框架中，特别是在使用JdbcTemplate或者Spring Data JPA时，通常会有更加优雅的方式来处理这种带参数的查询，而不需要手动替换这些占位符。"},{"prompt":"springaop根据注解切面，怎么获取这个注解","completion":"在Spring AOP中，如果您想基于注解创建一个切面，并在运行时获取该注解的信息，您可以通过反射来实现。这通常在@Before, @After, @Around等切点指示器中实现。 以下是一个简单的示例，展示了如何创建一个注解，一个使用该注解的方法，以及一个切面，在这个切面中获取注解并读取其值： **步骤 1: 创建自定义注解** 首先，创建一个自定义注解。设定为只能注解方法： ```java @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyAnnotation { String value() default \\"\\"; } ``` **步骤 2: 创建一个使用自定义注解的服务** 然后，在服务层的某个方法上使用这个注解： ```java @Service public class MyService { @MyAnnotation(value = \\"Hello Annotation\\") public void annotatedMethod() { System.out.println(\\"Executing annotated method...\\"); } } ``` **步骤 3: 创建切面并获取注解** 最后，创建一个切面，在切面内部获取方法上的注解： ```java @Aspect @Component public class MyAspect { @Around(\\"@annotation(myAnnotation)\\") // 拦截含有MyAnnotation注解的方法 public Object myAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint, MyAnnotation myAnnotation) throws Throwable { // 从方法上获取MyAnnotation注解的实例 System.out.println(\\"Annotation value: \\" + myAnnotation.value()); // 继续执行原方法 Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); return result; } } ``` 请注意，@Around注解中使用的`@annotation(myAnnotation)`表达式。这意味着Spring AOP将为所有使用`@MyAnnotation`注解的方法调用此Advice，并且`myAnnotation`参数将被自动填充为目标方法上的`@MyAnnotation`实例，从而允许您在Advice内部访问注解的属性。 **确保您的应用被配置为启用AOP代理**, 通常是在Spring配置文件或启动类上添加`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`。 ```java @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy public class AppConfig { } ``` 或者，如果您使用Spring Boot，通常只需通过添加依赖和使用`@SpringBootApplication`来自动配置。 这个示例展示了如何在Spring AOP的环绕通知中获取和使用方法级别的注解。通过这种方式，您可以基于注解来增强方法的行为，这对于事务管理、日志记录等方面尤其有用。"},{"prompt":"@Around(“@annotation(myAnnotation)”) // 拦截含有MyAnnotation注解的方法 public Object myAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint,

AOP环绕通知中基于方法注解拦截并获取注解信息，我们应该先通过`ProceedingJoinPoint`获取目标方法，然后使用反射来访问注解。这里是如何做的： 修改原先的AOP切面的实现，如下： ```java @Aspect @Component public class MyAspect { @Around(\\"@annotation(myAnnotationClass)\\") // 分别指向注解类 public Object myAdvice(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint, MyAnnotation myAnnotationClass) throws Throwable { // 通常不会直接这样获取注解，需要修改 // 而是先获取方法，然后获取方法上的注解 MethodSignature methodSignature =

= myAnnotation.value(); // 获取注解值 System.out.println(\\"Annotation value: \\" + value); } // 继续执行原方法 return joinPoint.proceed(); } } ``` 在这个修订后的例子中，我没有直接通过`@Around`方法的参数获取注解（这是我之前错误地提到的方法），因为实际上这种做法是不被支持的。 而是，通过Advice方法内的代码，使用反射获取到当前切点所代表的方法，然后从这个方法中获取注解信息。这里，`MethodSignature`和`Method`被用于从`ProceedingJoinPoint`获取正在被调用的方法的元数据。一旦得到这个方法引用，就可以使用`getAnnotation`方法获取`MyAnnotation`实例，并进一步访问它的属性了。

针对您提到的“influxFluxQuery”这个特定情况，假设您想要在切面中获取方法上名为`influxFluxQuery`的参数，首先确保您的方法签名中确实有这个参数，然后在切面表达式中正确引用这个参数。 以下是一些基于您当前问题的建议解决方案： # 如果您是想基于参数类型进行拦截： 假设`influxFluxQuery`是方法的参数，而且您想拦截所有具有这种类型参数的方法。您可以使用args表达式： ```java @Around(\\"execution(* com.yourpackage..*.*(.., com.yourpackage.InfluxFluxQuery, ..))\\") public Object adviceMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable { // Advice逻辑 Object result = pjp.proceed(); return result; } ``` 在上面的示例中，`com.yourpackage.InfluxFluxQuery`应该替换成实际的类全名，这种方式并不直接引用参数名，而是通过参数类型。 # 如果您是想根据注解拦截： ```java @Around(\\"@annotation(yourAnnotation)\\") public Object adviceMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp, YourAnnotation yourAnnotation) throws Throwable { // 现在可以访问yourAnnotation以及pjp.proceed() Object result = pjp.proceed(); return result; } ``` 这种方式用于拦截使用了特定注解的方法，而不是基于参数名称或类型。 # 如果您尝试基于方法的具体参数名称进行拦截： 确保您使用正确的方式来引用参数。对于Spring AOP，建议的做法是通过`args`、`@args`、`execution`等方式或者结合`@annotation`访问注解，或者利用`JoinPoint`或`ProceedingJoinPoint`在Advice中直接获取参数，而不是在表达式中尝试映射具体的参数名。 如果您确定需要基于参数名称访问参数（这不是Spring AOP的典型用法，且容易出错），需要在执行时通过反射等方式与具体的参数名打交道。

在您的通知方法中，首先使用`JoinPoint`或`ProceedingJoinPoint`（对于`@Around`通知）来获取方法参数，然后通过参数索引或循环检查来找到您想要的参数。请注意，这种方式不依赖于参数名称，是通过参数位置或类型来访问的。 ```java @Around(\\"execution(* com.yourpackage..*(..))\\") // 请根据实际情况调整表达式

如果`influxFluxQuery`参数是被某个注解标记的（例如，当处理Web请求参数时），您可以通过该注解拦截具有此参数的方法。但是，这通常用于处理特定的参数注解情况，如Spring MVC中的`@RequestParam`、`@PathVariable`等。例如： ```java @Around(\\"@annotation(org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping)\\") public Object yourAdviceMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable { // 此处获取参数的方法与上述相同 return joinPoint.proceed(); } ``` 但是直接通过AOP表达式按参数名来绑定特定的形参（例如`influxFluxQuery`）不是Spring AOP支持的功能。Spring AOP可以让您基于类、方法名以及方法参数的类型进行切面的应用，但不可以直接通过参数名进行绑定和过滤。 如果您的需求是根据参数类型进行操作，那么方法一是最直接的选择。如果是特殊场景，其中参数具有注解，您可能需要针对特定场景寻找解决方案。 综上所述，如果错误是由于尝试直接通过参数名“influxFluxQuery”来绑定导致的，那么需要调整您的方法，转而使用支持的方式来访问参数，如上述方法一所示。希望这样直接回答了您的问题。"},{"prompt":"spring能获取方法返回List<Point>，的Point的class吗","completion":"在Spring框架中，获取到具体方法返回的泛型类型，如`List<Point>`中的`Point`，通常不是一个直接且简单的任务。Java泛型因类型擦除（Type Erasure）的原因，在运行时并不保留关于泛型参数的具体类型信息。这意味着，一旦代码被编译，与泛型相关的类型信息（本例中的`Point`）就会被删除，并且在运行时无法直接访问。 不过，有几种方法可以在特定上下文中间接获取这些信息，尽管它们可能需要一定的程序设计约定或额外的元数据： # 1. 如果您控制方法定义 如果您有方法定义的控制权，可以通过添加注解来保留泛型类型信息。例如，您可以自定义一个注解来明确标记方法返回的具体类型： ```java @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface ReturnType { Class<?> value(); } ``` 然后在方法上使用这个注解： ```java @ReturnType(value = Point.class) public List<Point> getPoints() { return new ArrayList<Point>(); } ``` 您可以在运行时通过反射来访问这个注解，从而获取到`Point`类型信息： ```java Method method = ... // 获取到方法对象 ReturnType returnTypeAnnotation = method.getAnnotation(ReturnType.class); Class<?> type = returnTypeAnnotation.value(); ``` # 2. 基于Spring的方法拦截器 如果您在一个Spring环境中，可能是在使用AOP或者类似的方法拦截机制。在这个上下文中，尽管直接获取返回类型为`List<Point>`的`Point`类型信息困难，您依然可以通过拦截方法调用，并在调用之后检查返回值的实际类型。但请注意，这种方式对于`null`返回值或空集合可能不适用，因为无法从中推断元素类型： ```java @Around(\\"execution(* your.package.*.*(..))\\") public Object interceptMethod(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable { Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); if (result instanceof List) { List<?> list = (List<?>) result; if (!list.isEmpty()) { Object firstElement = list.get(0); System.out.println(\\"Element type: \\" + firstElement.getClass().getName()); } } return result; } ``` # 3. 借助`TypeToken` 对于复杂泛型返回类型的反射，一个常见的替代方法是使用Google Guava库中的`TypeToken`类。`TypeToken`的设计是为了绕开Java类型擦除的限制。通过这种方式，您可以保留包括泛型在内的类型信息： ```java Type type = new TypeToken<List<Point>>() {}.getType(); ``` 不过，这种方法通常用于字段、方法参数或者类的类型参数，直接应用于检查方法的返回类型可能并不适用，除非您将`TypeToken`以某种方式整合到方法的返回值或注解中。 总之，由于Java的类型擦除，直接在运行时获取泛型返回类型的具体泛型参数（如`List<Point>`中的`Point`）是具有挑战性的。通常需要通过代码设计上的额外工作或者使用第三方库来间接实现这一需求。"},{"prompt":"注解里能写泛型吗","completion":"在Java中，注解本身不能直接声明泛型参数，例如，你不能定义一个泛型注解如`@MyAnnotation<T>`。注解的定义不支持这种泛型语法。注解是在Java 5引入的，它们的设计目标是提供一种轻量级的元数据机制，泛型参数在这里就不适用了。 然而，注解的方法可以返回一个`Class<?>`类型的值，这可以在一定程度上用来传递类的类型信息，但这并不是泛型。例如，你可以这样定义一个注解： ```java import java.lang.annotation.ElementType; import java.lang.annotation.Retention; import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy; import java.lang.annotation.Target; @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target({ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.TYPE}) public @interface MyAnnotation { Class<?> value() default Void.class; // 这里不能声明泛型类型，但可以返回Class类型的对象 } ``` 这种方式允许你在使用注解时指定一个类类型，例如： ```java @MyAnnotation(String.class) public void myMethod() { // 方法体 } ``` 如果你的目的是想要在注解中用某种方式模拟或利用泛型的行为，你可以考虑设计注解使其方法返回`Class<?>`类型。然而，需要记住的是这种方式不提供真正的泛型支持，因为类型信息在运行时是不可知的（这也被称为类型擦除）。 在特定情况下，结合注解和泛型可以提供一些有趣的能力，比如结合Java反射和注解来实现一些基于类型的逻辑处理，但这通常会更加复杂，并且要小心处理`Class<?>`类型的强制类型转换和相关的编译器警告。

AOP（面向切面编程）来生成代理类，这在很大程度上简化了代理类的生成和管理。Spring AOP默认使用JDK动态代理或CGLIB来创建代理，选择哪种方式主要取决于目标对象是否实现了接口。 默认情况下，如果目标对象实现了至少一个接口，Spring AOP会使用JDK动态代理；如果目标对象没有实现任何接口，则使用CGLIB。 要在Spring中强制使用CGLIB代理（即使目标对象实现了接口），可以通过配置`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy`注解的`proxyTargetClass`属性为`true`。这可以确保Spring AOP使用CGLIB代理，而不是JDK动态代理。 ```java @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass =

<dependency> <groupId>org.springframework</groupId> <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId> <version>你的Spring版本</version> </dependency> ``` 注意：Spring的`spring-core`库已经包括了CGLIB，因此不需要额外添加CGLIB库。

Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(MyClass.class); // MyClass是你想要代理的类 enhancer.setCallback((FixedValue) () -> \\"Hello Cglib\\"); // 这里简单地为所有方法返回相同的字符串 MyClass myClassProxy = (MyClass) enhancer.create(); System.out.println(myClassProxy.myMethod()); // 调用代理对象的方法 } public static class MyClass { public String myMethod() { return \\"Original method call\\"; } } } ``` 这个简单的示例演示了如何使用CGLIB创建`MyClass`的代理类，其中所有方法调用都返回相同的字符串。这里，`FixedValue`只是`org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Callback`接口实现之一，用于拦截对代理对象的所有方法调用。 请注意，直接使用CGLIB相对较底层，Spring AOP为常见代理和拦截模式提供了更高级别的抽象。如果你的目的是在Spring环境中使用代理进行AOP，建议使用Spring AOP和其提供的注解和配置方式，这样可以更容易地维护和集成。"},{"prompt":"我的意思是，我定义一个接口，在方法上写注解，然后spring启动的时候，注入我通过注解自定义的代理bean（继承这个接口，然后按照注解生成方法），这样我就可以在其他地方注入这个接口，但实际上是用的我注入spring容器的代理类","completion":"明白你的需求了，你想定义一个接口并在其方法上应用自定义注解，然后在Spring容器启动时动态地创建这个接口的代理实现，并将这个代理实现注入到Spring容器中。当你在应用的其他地方注入这个接口时，Spring实际上会注入这个代理实现。这种模式类似于Spring Cloud Feign客户端或是Spring Data Repository的工作方式。 要实现这样的功能，你可以利用Spring的`FactoryBean`、`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`以及CGLIB代理（或者根据需要选择其他代理技术）。下面是一个简化的实现示例： # 1. 定义你的接口和自定义注解 首先，定义一个简单的接口以及一个自定义注解，用于在接口的方法上标记和提供一些元数据。 ```java public interface MyServiceInterface { @MyCustomAnnotation String process(String input); } @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyCustomAnnotation { // 定义你需要的属性 } ``` # 2. 创建一个代理类生成器 接着，创建一个类用于基于你的接口和注解生成代理实现。在这个例子中，使用CGLIB来动态生成实现： ```java public class MyServiceInterfaceProxy implements MethodInterceptor { @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable { // 在这里实现你的代理逻辑，例如根据方法注解来动态改变行为 if (method.isAnnotationPresent(MyCustomAnnotation.class)) { // 示例逻辑：打印一个消息，然后调用原方法 System.out.println(\\"MyCustomAnnotation is present, doing something special.\\"); } return \\"Proxy: \\" + args[0]; // 示例返回 } public static Object createProxy(Class<?> targetClass) { Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(targetClass); enhancer.setCallback(new MyServiceInterfaceProxy()); return enhancer.create(); } } ``` # 3. 注册代理实现到Spring容器 现在，你需要在Spring容器中注册这个代理实现。一种方式是使用`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`来动态注册Bean定义： ```java @Component public class MyServiceInterfaceRegistrar implements BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor, ApplicationContextAware { private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Override public void postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry(BeanDefinitionRegistry registry) throws BeansException { Object proxy = MyServiceInterfaceProxy.createProxy(MyServiceInterface.class); // 注册代理Bean registry.registerBeanDefinition(\\"myServiceInterfaceProxy\\", BeanDefinitionBuilder.genericBeanDefinition(MyServiceInterface.class, () -> proxy) .getBeanDefinition()); } @Override public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException { // 通常不需要在这个方法中实现逻辑 } @Override public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } } ``` 通过以上步骤，`MyServiceInterface.class`的代理实现会被创建并注册到Spring容器中。你可以在应用的其他地方通过@Autowired来注入`MyServiceInterface`，Spring会提供这个代理实现。 # 注意 这个实现是非常基础和简化的，仅为了演示基本概念。在真实的应用中，你可能需要对此进行扩展和调整，例如支持方法级的代理逻辑、与Spring AOP集成、考虑事务等。另外，根据你的需求，可能还需要处理接口中的默认方法、处理特殊的返回类型等复杂的场景。 这种模式在创建像是Feign客户端、Spring Data Repositories或其他需要基于接口动态创建实现的情况下相当有用，但请记得这样会增加应用的复杂性，并且需要仔细管理Spring的Bean生命周期。"},{"prompt":"对实现了某一接口的所有接口都做这种代理","completion":"要对实现了某一特定接口的所有接口实现进行代理，你可以采用稍微不同的方法。这个过程涉及到在Spring应用上下文中查找所有实现了特定接口的bean，然后为他们生成代理并重新注册到Spring容器中。下面是一种实现此目标的方法： # 1. 定义目标接口 假设我们有一个目标接口`TargetInterface`，我们希望为所有实现了此接口的类自动生成代理： ```java public interface TargetInterface { void performAction(); } ``` # 2. 创建一个通用的代理创建器 接下来，创造一个类用于生成代理。在这个例子中，我们仍然使用CGLIB： ```java public class GenericProxyCreator { public static Object createProxy(Class<?> targetClass, Class<?> interfaceClass) { Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(targetClass); enhancer.setInterfaces(new Class[] { interfaceClass }); enhancer.setCallback(new MethodInterceptor() { @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable { // 你可以在这里实现代理逻辑 System.out.println(\\"Before method: \\" + method.getName()); Object result = proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args); System.out.println(\\"After method: \\" + method.getName()); return result; } }); return enhancer.create(); } } ``` # 3. 动态代理注册器实现 通过实现`BeanPostProcessor`接口，我们可以拦截Spring容器的bean初始化过程，在bean实例化之后，初始化之前插入我们的代理逻辑： ```java @Component public class ProxyBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor, ApplicationContextAware { private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Override public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException { if (bean instanceof TargetInterface) { // 如果bean实现了TargetInterface接口，则为其创建代理 return GenericProxyCreator.createProxy(bean.getClass(), TargetInterface.class); } return bean; // 其他bean保持不变 } @Override public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } } ``` 在这个`ProxyBeanPostProcessor`中，我们检查每个bean是否是`TargetInterface`的实例。如果是，我们就使用`GenericProxyCreator.createProxy`方法为其创建代理。这样，对于任何实现了`TargetInterface`接口的bean，Spring在初始化这些bean的时候都会自动用我们的代理对象替换它们的实例。 # 注意 - 通过使用`BeanPostProcessor`，我们可以确保Spring容器中所有实现了`TargetInterface`接口的bean都被代理，而无需显式注册每个代理bean。 - 如果你的代理逻辑非常特定（例如，依赖于特定注解或需要访问Spring容器中的其他bean），你可能需要在`postProcessBeforeInitialization`方法中添加更多逻辑来处理这些情况。 - 请注意，代理对象将替换原始bean的引用，这意味着Spring容器中其他地方对这些bean的引用也会使用代理对象。这可能对bean的预期行为有影响，特别是在涉及到继承、接口实现和类型检查时。确保你的代理逻辑不会意外改变bean的核心行为。 这种策略非常适合在运行时动态增强多个bean的行为，特别是当这些bean遵循通用接口或类继承结构时。通过对bean实例化过程的干预，我们可以在不修改原始代码的情况下注入自定义逻辑，这为应用的扩展和模块化提供了强大的灵活性。"},{"prompt":"我的接口没写spring注解，postProcessBeforeInitialization也能对接口扫描吗","completion":"如果您的接口没有标记为Spring管理的组件（即，没有使用Spring的注解如`@Component`、`@Service`等），`BeanPostProcessor` 本身并不会对接口实现类自动应用代理，因为 `BeanPostProcessor` 操作的是 Spring 管理的 bean。即，您的接口实现类需要以某种方式被 Spring 管理（通过注解、XML配置或Java配置）才能被 `BeanPostProcessor` 拦截和处理。 `BeanPostProcessor` 主要是修改或包装已经被 Spring 容器识别的 bean 实例。如果您有接口实现类并期望这些实现能够被自动代理，这些实现类需要被 Spring 容器管理。通常这意味着您的实现类上需要有 Spring的注解（如 `@Component`），或者您必需以其他方式将它们注册为 Spring 容器中的 bean（例如，通过 Java 配置类）。 如果您的接口实现类尚未被Spring容器管理，您可以使用以下方法之一将它们注册到Spring容器中： # 通过组件扫描 确保接口实现类位于Spring 的组件扫描路径下，并使用`@Component`、`@Service`等注解标记它们： ```java @Component public class MyTargetInterfaceImpl implements TargetInterface { @Override public void performAction() { // 实现细节 } } ``` 确保您的Spring配置中启用了组件扫描，并且 covers 包含了接口实现类的包： ```java @Configuration @ComponentScan(basePackages = \\"com.yourpackage\\") public class AppConfig { } ``` # 通过Java配置显式注册 如果出于某种原因，您无法在接口实现类上使用注解，可以在Java配置类中显式注册这些实现类为bean： ```java @Configuration public class AppConfig { @Bean public TargetInterface myTargetInterfaceImpl() { return new MyTargetInterfaceImpl(); } } ``` 只有确保接口实现类是作为Spring管理的bean注册后，`BeanPostProcessor`才能够对其进行拦截和处理。 # 使用`BeanPostProcessor` 拦截和动态代理 一旦接口实现类通过前述方法之一被注册为Spring管理的bean，`BeanPostProcessor`可以按前述回答中所述应用代理逻辑。 # 结论 `BeanPostProcessor`和其他Spring拦截器/处理器只能作用于由Spring容器管理的bean。为了让接口实现类能够被`BeanPostProcessor`处理，您需要确保这些实现类是以bean的形式注册在Spring容器中的。这通常通过标记Spring管理的注解，或在配置类中显式注册来实现。"},{"prompt":"我的意思是，我定义一个接口，在方法上写注解，然后spring启动的时候，注入我通过注解自定义的代理bean（继承这个接口，然后按照注解生成方法），这样我就可以在其他地方注入这个接口，但实际上是用的我注入spring容器的代理类。注意，我的意思是所有实现了另一个接口的所有接口都实现这一逻辑，并且我的所有接口都不加其他注解","completion":"了解到您的需求是想在Spring应用中动态创建代理类，这些代理类基于特定接口（我们称其为`BaseInterface`）及在这些接口方法上指定的自定义注解来生成。这些代理将在运行时根据注解自动实现接口的方法，并且这些代理类在其他地方被注入时，Spring容器将提供代理实现而不是直接的实现。此外，要为实现了`BaseInterface`的所有接口应用此逻辑，即便这些接口没有被标记为Spring管理的组件（即，没有使用`@Component`或其他相关注解）。 要达到这样的目标，可以考虑使用如下技术组合： 1. **自定义注解** - 用来标记接口方法，便于运行时通过代理实现逻辑。 2. **`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`** - 用于在Spring容器初始化过程中，动态注册代理bean。 3. **接口代理技术** - 使用Java的动态代理或CGLIB等生成代理实现。 这项需求的实现较为复杂，因为涉及到在Spring应用初始化阶段动态扫描接口、生成代理，并将这些代理注册为bean。下面提供一种可能的解决方案示例： # 步骤1: 定义自定义注解 首先，定义一个注解`MyCustomMethodAnnotation`，用于标记接口中需要特殊处理的方法。 ```java @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyCustomMethodAnnotation { String value() default \\"\\"; } ``` # 步骤2: 创建一个代理类生成器 该生成器使用Java的动态代理实现代理逻辑。 ```java import java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler; import java.lang.reflect.Method; import java.lang.reflect.Proxy; public class DynamicProxyGenerator { @SuppressWarnings(\\"unchecked\\") public static <T> T createProxy(Class<T> interfaceType) { return (T) Proxy.newProxyInstance( interfaceType.getClassLoader(), new Class<?>[] {interfaceType}, new InvocationHandler() { @Override public Object invoke(Object

method.getAnnotation(MyCustomMethodAnnotation.class).value()); return \\"Proxy response based on annotation\\"; } throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"Method without annotation not supported\\"); } }); } } ``` # 步骤3: 动态注册代理bean 使用`BeanFactoryPostProcessor`来动态扫描指定的接口、生成代理，并注册到Spring容器中。 ```java @Component public class ProxyBeanRegistrar implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor { @Override public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException { // 此处示例代码假定你已经能够以某种方式获取到所有目标接口类 Class<?>[] targetInterfaces = {/* 获取目标接口类 */}; for

DynamicProxyGenerator.createProxy((Class<BaseInterface>) targetInterface); beanFactory.registerSingleton(targetInterface.getName(), proxy); } } } } ``` # 注意： - 在真实情况中，“获取目标接口类”可能需要用到类扫描库（如Spring的`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`或其他第三方库）来在指定的包中查找所有实现了`BaseInterface`接口的接口。 - 请适当调整上面代码的错误处理逻辑，确保其满足你的具体需求。 - 这种方法依赖于在容器启动阶段注册代理实现，因此需要小心管理代理实例的生命周期。 通过上述方式，应用启动时会动态创建并注册接口的代理实现，这些实现将根据你的自定义注解来响应方法调用。这允许你在应用中的其他部分通过Spring正常注入这些接口，而实际使用的将是动态生成的代理实现。"},{"prompt":"// 此处示例代码假定你已经能够以某种方式获取到所有目标接口类 spring有一种方式应该可以获取","completion":"是的，Spring 提供了一些机制来扫描和识别类路径下的类和接口，便于实现像自动检测目标接口类这样的功能。一个常用的工具是 `ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider` ，它可以用来查找类路径下的候选组件。以下是如何使用 `ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider` 来查找实现了特定接口或带有特定注解的所有类或接口： # 步骤1: 使用 `ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider` 查找目标接口 这个例子展示如何找到所有实现了 `BaseInterface` 接口的接口或类： ```java import org.springframework.context.annotation.ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider; import org.springframework.core.type.filter.AssignableTypeFilter; public List<Class<?>> findTargetInterfaces(String basePackage) { ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider provider = new

Class.forName(candidateComponent.getBeanClassName()); targetInterfaces.add(cls); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { // Handle or log the exception as needed } } return targetInterfaces; } ``` 这段代码中，`basePackage` 是要扫描的基础包名， `BaseInterface` 是你要寻找实现的目标接口。这个方法会返回一个 `Class<?>` 类型的列表，其中包含了所有找到的目标接口实现。 # 步骤2: 动态注册找到的接口代理 接下来，就可以在 `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` 实现中调用上述 `findTargetInterfaces` 方法来动态注册每个找到的目标接口的代理实例了： ```java @Component public class ProxyBeanRegistrar implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor { @Override public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException { // 假定“com.example”是你想要扫描的包 List<Class<?>> targetInterfaces = findTargetInterfaces(\\"com.example\\"); for (Class<?> targetInterface : targetInterfaces) { Object

Implementation here... } } ``` 请确保 `findTargetInterfaces` 方法的实现与前一步骤中的代码相匹配，并根据实际情况调整包名和其他参数。 # 注意 - 这种方法适用于在应用启动阶段动态检测和注册代理，但要注意，它并不会考虑使用 `@Conditional` 或其他条件性注册逻辑。 - 因为这里使用了 `Class.forName`，这意味着在这一步骤中，目标类会被加载到JVM，但还没有被实例化。 - 如果目标接口或要代理的实现类在多个模块或jar包中，确保这些模块或jar包都在应用的类路径中。

参数和返回值都是什么含义","completion":"在CGLIB库中，`MethodInterceptor` 接口的 `intercept` 方法是实现方法拦截的关键。这个方法在代理对象上的每次方法调用时都会被触发。让我们逐个了解 `intercept` 方法的参数和返回值的含义： # 参数 - `Object obj`：这是代理对象实例本身，即方法调用的\\"this\\"引用。它允许你在`intercept`方法内部访问到正在被代理的对象。 - `Method method`：这是被调用的原始方法的`java.lang.reflect.Method`实例。通过这个参数，你可以获取方法的各种元数据（如方法名、参数类型、注解等），并根据它来决定拦截逻辑。 - `Object[] args`：这是一个包含了方法调用时传递给方法的所有参数的数组。这让你有机会在调用原始方法前修改、替换或添加新的参数值。 - `MethodProxy proxy`：这是一个由CGLIB生成的用于代理方法调用的对象。与直接使用反射调用`method.invoke()`不同，`proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args)`提供了一种更高效的方式来调用原始方法（即没有被拦截的方法）。它是专门为每个被代理的方法生成的，因此调用效率比使用标准Java反射更高。 # 返回值 - `Object`：`intercept` 方法的返回值类型为 `Object`，这意味着它可以返回任意类型的对象。这个返回值将会被返回给调用代理对象方法的调用者。因此，这个返回值应该与原始方法签名的返回类型兼容，否则可能导致 `ClassCastException`。 # 使用示例 在`intercept`方法内部，你可以基于`method`参数的信息（比如方法名、注解等）来执行不同的逻辑分支。通常，你可能会执行以下一种或多种操作： 1. **修改输入参数**：在调用原始方法之前修改`args`数组中的值。 2. **替换方法实现**：完全替换掉原始方法的逻辑，返回一个自定义的结果。 3. **在方法前后执行额外逻辑**：在调用原始方法前后，执行一些附加操作（比如日志记录、权限检查等）。 4. **调用原始方法**：通过`proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args)`调用原始方法，并根据需要处理或转换结果。 5. **阻塞方法调用**：在某些情况下，你可能决定不调用原始方法，而是直接返回一个固定的值或抛出异常。 这种拦截机制为在运行时动态修改对象的行为提供了极大的灵活性和强大的控制能力。"},{"prompt":"如果是通过接口实现的代理，return method.invoke(obj, args)会报错吗，因为是接口","completion":"如果您是通过接口实现的代理，并尝试在CGLIB的`MethodInterceptor`中使用`method.invoke(obj,

args)`），由于`obj`实际是一个代理对象，没有直接的实现体，这将导致`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`或其他错误，因为接口方法没有具体的实现可以被调用。 2. **接口方法没有直接实现**：由于`obj`指向的是一个CGLIB生成的代理对象，而不是具体的实现实例，接口上的方法实际上没有一个\\"直接\\"的实现可以通过反射调用。这意味着`method.invoke(obj, args)`试图在一个没有实现的接口上执行操作，这在逻辑上是不成立的。 # 解决办法 对于接口方法的代理，并希望能够在调用时执行某些特定逻辑，您应该直接在`MethodInterceptor`的`intercept`方法中实现这些逻辑，而不是尝试使用`method.invoke(obj, args)`来调用原始方法。 例如，您可以根据方法名、方法参数等条件来判断并执行不同的自定义逻辑： ```java @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable { if (\\"someMethod\\".equals(method.getName())) { // 对特定方法执行自定义逻辑 System.out.println(\\"执行 someMethod 的逻辑\\"); // 根据需要返回相应的值 return \\"特定逻辑的返回值\\"; } // 对于未特别处理的方法，可能需要抛出异常，或者返回默认值，这取决于您的应用需求 throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"未实现的方法：\\" + method.getName()); } ``` 通过这种方式，您直接控制了对代理方法的调用，可以根据实际需要在其中实现逻辑，而不是试图调用实际的接口方法实现（因为实际上并不存在实现）。 总之，当使用CGLIB或其他代理技术对接口进行代理时，应避免试图通过反射直接调用接口方法，而是应该直接在代理的拦截器或处理器中实现所需的逻辑。这种方式更加灵活并且不依赖于接口方法的实际实现，因为在代理场景下这些实现可能根本就不存在。"},{"prompt":"ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider provider = new

Spring的`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`设计之初是用来找到可以作为Spring管理的bean的类，它们需要被实例化和管理。接口不能直接实例化，通常也不会独立地注册为bean。在大多数Spring应用中，关注点是那些可以创建实例的具体类。ApplicationContext主要管理这些类的实例，而不是接口。

ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider provider = new ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider(false); provider.addIncludeFilter(new TypeFilter() { @Override public boolean match(MetadataReader metadataReader, MetadataReaderFactory metadataReaderFactory) throws IOException { // 通过反射载入当前扫描到的类 try { Class<?> c =

这段代码中，`YourInterface.class`是您想要查找所有实现了该接口的类和接口。使用`Class.forName`来加载`MetadataReader`当前扫描到的类或接口，然后通过`YourInterface.class.isAssignableFrom(c)`检查这个类或接口是否实现了`YourInterface`接口。这样的话，无论`YourInterface`是一个类还是一个接口，这段代码都能正确地识别出那些实现了或继承了`YourInterface`的类和接口。 需要注意的是，这种方法实际上为了进行类型检查而加载了每一个扫描到的类。尽管这在大多数情况下都是可行的，但在某些特定环境下，如果类的加载代价特别高，或者如果存在大量的类需要被扫描，这可能会导致性能问题。"},{"prompt":"ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider 是不是不会扫描接口类？？？","completion":"`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider` 默认设置是用来扫描那些标注为Spring组件的类（如标注了`@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`等注解的类）。默认情况下，它并不会扫描接口，因为在Spring框架的使用场景中，通常是基于类的Bean定义被创建和管理。接口不能直接实例化，因此它们不会被视为候选的组件。 然而，通过自定义`TypeFilter`，`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`可以被配置来识别和包含接口。这是通过在你创建`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`实例时传递`false`给构造函数（关闭默认的过滤器），然后添加自定义过滤器来完成的，这样就可以确保按照你的需求来扫描包括接口在内的类。 例如，如果你想使用`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`扫描实现了特定接口或者标注了特定注解的接口，你可以添加一个自定义的`TypeFilter`，这个过滤器将基于类的元数据（可以通过`MetadataReader`访问）来决定一个给定的类(或接口)是否匹配。这个过程不是基于Spring框架能否将其作为bean实例化，而是基于你定义的逻辑，例如类的名称、是否是接口、是否存在指定的注解等。 ```java ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider provider = new ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider(false); // 关闭默认过滤器 // Include a custom filter that includes interfaces provider.addIncludeFilter(new TypeFilter() { @Override public boolean match(MetadataReader metadataReader, MetadataReaderFactory metadataReaderFactory) throws IOException { return metadataReader.getClassMetadata().isInterface(); } }); ``` 在上述代码中，`match`方法返回`true`仅当被扫描的类是一个接口。这样就允许`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`扫描并识别接口了。

您的反馈是正确的，我的之前的说明存在误导，感谢您的耐心和指正。在Spring框架中，如果需要寻找特定接口的所有实现，通常会采用别的方法来实现，而不是使用`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider`。对于想要发现实现了特定接口的类，更常见的做法包括使用Java的`ServiceLoader`机制，或者通过集成的第三方库如`Reflections`来进行扫描：

default","completion":"在使用CGLIB创建代理时，确实会遇到特定挑战，尤其是关于如何正确处理Java 8引入的接口默认方法。CGLIB主要用于代理类，而不是接口，因为它是通过生成一个子类来实现代理的。但是，当用CGLIB代理一个接口并尝试通过MethodInterceptor拦截方法调用时，可能会遇到无法直接拦截接口的默认方法的问题。 如果你的目标是让CGLIB处理接口中定义的默认方法，首先需要理解的是，由于默认方法的特殊性（它们有实现体），单纯通过CGLIB代理这样的接口无法直接拦截到默认方法的执行。这是因为CGLIB主要是通过创建子类的方式动态生成代理对象，而对于接口默认方法而言，并没有简单的方式能通过子类化（继承）来重写或拦截。 # 解决方案 一种可能的解决方案是手动在代理的`MethodInterceptor`实现中检查并调用接口的默认方法。Java反射API中的`Method`类提供了`isDefault()`方法，可以用于检测一个方法是否是接口的默认方法。如果是，你可以通过反射来手动执行这个默认方法。下面是一个大概的示例： ```java import

您需要保证能够获取到正确的调用对象实例（对于接口默认方法，理论上不需要实例，但需要正确的类型引用）。但在这种情况下，如果接口方法是默认方法，并且我们需要对其进行特殊处理，我们实际上不能直接在CGLIB的`intercept`方法中调用它，因为那里没有具体的实现实例参与。为了绕过这一点，考虑以下改进： # 调整代码以避免`ClassCastException`： ```java @Override

结论： 上面的做法是基于您当前问提（使用CGLIB代理且需要绕过接口默认方法），做出的一种可行的改进。然而，对于一般的使用情况，如无特殊需要，考虑使用更自然支持接口代理的JDK动态代理或调整应用设计以避免这种复杂的场景，往往会是更佳选择。希望这能帮到您，如果还有其他问题或疑问，请继续提问。"},{"prompt":"cglib创建对象时，可否获取方法返回List里的具体类型","completion":"在Java中，由于类型擦除（Type Erasure），泛型信息在运行时并不会被保留。这意味着，当你在运行时使用Reflection API（反射API）去检查一个类或方法时，你通常无法直接获取到泛型参数的具体类型，例如，一个方法返回`List<String>`类型，在运行时你只能知道这是一个`List`，但无法知道这个`List`里面装的是`String`类型的元素。 但是，有一种例外情况，那就是当泛型类型被用作类、接口或方法的成员时，通过Java的反射API可以通过`getGenericReturnType`方法获取到具体的泛型信息，这是因为这些信息被存储在类或方法的签名中。然而，这通常不适用于通过CGLIB或任何其他库动态创建的对象，因为这些动态代理或增强的类并不会在其方法签名中包含新的泛型信息。 如果你有一个方法，比如： ```java public

不过，您可以考虑以下几种方法来规遍或缓解这种限制： # 1. 更新库版本 确保您使用的库（如CGLIB、Spring等）是最新的，或者确认它们支持Java 9及以上版本。随着时间的推移，许多库都已经发布了更新版本，以解决Java模块系统带来的问题。 # 2. 使用JDK动态代理代替CGLIB JDK提供了自己的动态代理机制，可以用来创建接口的代理实现。如果您代理的目标主要是接口而非类，那么JDK动态代理可以作为CGLIB的替代，而且不受`--add-opens`限制的影响。JDK动态代理的限制是它只能代理接口。 ```java YourInterface proxy = (YourInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance( YourInterface.class.getClassLoader(), new Class<?>[] { YourInterface.class }, (proxy, method, args) -> { // 实现您的方法拦截逻辑 return null; }); ``` # 3. 考虑使用字节码编程

对于某些特定场景，您可能通过使用变通的方法来避免直接反射调用受限的核心API。例如，利用Java的服务加载机制`ServiceLoader`或考虑其他设计模式，如工厂模式、策略模式等来减少对反射的依赖。 # 5. 调整JVM参数（不推荐） 虽然这不是去除`--add-opens`的方法，但改变运行时参数以避免JVM退出可以适用于测试环境或非生产环境。如极端情况下，压缩指针（Compressed

总之，确实，InfluxDB的一些写入模式表现出了幂等性质，但是理解和应用这一特性时，必须详细考虑具体的数据模型和写入场景。在进行数据导入或同步等场景设计时，幂等性是一个非常重要的属性，可以帮助减少重复数据和避免数据不一致的问题。"},{"prompt":"mongodb是怎么解决读一致性问题的，写一致性用的raft协议吗","completion":"MongoDB 解决读写一致性问题的机制涉及到几个关键概念，包括副本集（Replica Sets），以及在副本集内部如何处理读写操作。MongoDB使用的是基于选票的协议来确保写入的一致性，这个协议在一定程度上类似于Raft，但MongoDB并没有直接声明其使用标准的Raft协议。 # 写一致性 在MongoDB的副本集中，数据的写操作首先发生在主节点（Primary）上，然后被复制到从节点（Secondaries）。MongoDB通过以下机制来确保写一致性： - **写确认（Write Concern）**：写操作在MongoDB中可以被配置为等待不同级别的确认，以确保写入的一致性和持久性。最简单的写确认是写入到主节点后即确认成功，但这不保证数据已被复制到从节点。更强的写确认可以要求写操作在指定数量的从节点上成功复制后才确认成功，这有助于确保数据的持久化和复制的一致性。 - **副本集的选举**：当主节点不可用时（比如因为故障或网络问题），剩余的从节点将举行选举以选出新的主节点。MongoDB在这个过程中使用基于选票的算法来确保选举的公平性和一致性。 # 读一致性 MongoDB通过以下方式来支持读一致性： - **读关注级别（Read Concern）**：MongoDB支持不同级别的读关注来控制读操作如何从副本集中的节点获取数据。默认情况下，读操作是从主节点执行的，以获取最新的一致性数据。然而，应用程序可以配置读关注级别，以从从节点读取数据，甚至是只读取那些已经被多数节点确认的数据，来满足不同的一致性需求。 - **因果一致性（Causal Consistency）**：MongoDB通过会话（Sessions）支持因果一致性模型，允许应用程序执行一系列的读写操作，这些操作在逻辑上是一致的，即使它们被分布到了不同的服务器上。这有助于解决在分布式系统中常见的一致性问题，比如读取到过时数据。 # 总结 虽然MongoDB的一些原理与Raft协议相似，尤其是在进行选举和确保写一致性的过程中，但MongoDB实现了自己的一套机制（如写确认和读关注级别），以支持不同级别的数据一致性需求。MongoDB通过副本集和这些可配置的一致性选项提供了灵活的一致性模型，使得开发者可以根据应用场景的具体要求来权衡数据的一致性、可用性和分区容忍性。"},{"prompt":"因果一致性什么意思","completion":"因果一致性（Causal Consistency）是分布式系统中的一种数据一致性模型，它确保如果一个操作在因果上先于另一个操作（即，一个操作以某种方式影响了另一个操作的发生），那么所有的节点（或客户端）都将按照这种因果顺序来观察到这些操作。简而言之，因果一致性模型保证了“因果相关的操作”在系统中的可见顺序。 # 因果一致性的基本概念： - **因果顺序**：如果操作A在时间上先于操作B，并且可能对B产生了影响（例如，A写入了某个数据项，B随后读取或更新了这个数据项），那么我们说A因果上先于B。因果一致性要求这种顺序在所有节点上得到保持和尊重。 - **并发操作**：如果两个操作既不是因果关联的，也没有因果关系限制它们的执行顺序（互相独立），那么这两个操作是并发的。在这种情况下，系统不保证不同节点观察到这些操作的顺序一致。 # 因果一致性和其他一致性模型的对比： - 相比**强一致性**（或线性一致性），因果一致性为分布式系统提供了更高的可用性和性能表现，因为它不要求所有操作在全局上严格排序，只需保证因果相关的操作顺序即可。这降低了对全局同步的需求。 - **最终一致性**是一种较弱的一致性模型，它只保证如果系统停止接收新的更新操作，那么最终所有的节点将会达到一致的状态。因果一致性提供了比最终一致性更强的保证，特别是在处理因果相关的操作时。 # 应用场景： 因果一致性非常适合那些不要求绝对最新数据的应用，但需要保证操作的逻辑顺序，如社交网络的帖子和评论、协作编辑应用等。在这些场景下，因果一致性可以有效保证用户体验的连贯性和数据的逻辑一致性。 # 如何实现： 实现因果一致性通常需要在系统中追踪操作的因果依赖，例如，通过向每个操作关联一个逻辑时钟（如Lamport时钟或向量时钟）来记录和推断因果关系。这些机制帮助系统确定不同操作之间的逻辑先后顺序，从而在不同的节点上应用操作，以保持因果一致性。 总的来说，因果一致性是一种平衡性能、可用性和一致性保证的分布式系统一致性模型，非常适用于大规模和高动态的分布式应用。"},{"prompt":"就是顺序一致性，通过版本号","completion":"顺序一致性（Sequential Consistency）和通过版本号实现的一致性模型（例如，向量时钟或Lamport时钟用于实现因果一致性）属于不同的一致性策略，它们在分布式系统的数据一致性管理中有各自的应用场景和实现机制。让我们澄清这两种概念： # 顺序一致性 顺序一致性是一种较为严格的一致性模型。在顺序一致性模型中，系统中的所有操作都必须以一种全局一致的顺序被所有节点观察到，就好像这些操作是按照某种全局顺序依次串行地执行的一样。换句话说，即使操作实际上是并发执行的，所有节点也会认为这些操作是按照同一顺序执行的。顺序一致性不考虑操作实际发生的物理时间，而是侧重于操作在逻辑上的序列。这种一致性级别很难在没有严格同步机制的分布式系统中实现，通常会对系统的性能和可用性产生较大影响。 # 因果一致性和版本号 因果一致性（Causal Consistency）相比顺序一致性，提供了更灵活的一致性保证。它只要求因果相关的操作保持全局顺序，而并发操作（没有因果关系的操作）可以在不同的节点上以不同的顺序被观察到。向量时钟或Lamport时钟是实现因果一致性的常用技术，它们通过为每个操作分配一个逻辑时钟（版本号）来追踪操作之间的潜在因果关系。 - **向量时钟**：每个节点维护一组逻辑时钟，对于每个节点的每次操作，对应的时钟计数会增加。通过比较两组向量时钟，可以推断操作之间的潜在因果关系。 - **Lamport时钟**：是一种简化的向量时钟，为系统中的所有事件分配一个单向递增的全局时间戳。虽然Lamport时钟不能提供向量时钟那样详细的因果关系信息，但足以推断事件间的偏序关系。 # 总结 顺序一致性需要所有节点观察到全局一致的操作顺序，不区分操作之间是否存在因果关系。因果一致性通过版本号（例如向量时钟或Lamport时钟）来追踪和维持操作之间的因果关系。虽然两者都是解决数据一致性的模型，但应用场景、一致性保证的强度、以及对系统性能的影响各不相同。"},{"prompt":"如何用zookeeper解决雪花算法的时钟回拨","completion":"雪花算法（Snowflake Algorithm）是Twitter设计用于生成分布式系统中唯一ID的算法，主要解决在分布式系统中如何高效生成唯一标识符的问题。该算法生成的是一个64位的长整数，由时间戳（毫秒级别）、数据中心ID、机器ID和序列号四部分组成。其中，时间戳的回拨问题是雪花算法可能遇到的一个挑战，因为如果系统时间回拨，就可能生成重复的ID。 ZooKeeper是一个为分布式应用提供一致性服务的软件，可以用来解决时钟回拨问题。以下是使用ZooKeeper来解决雪花算法时钟回拨的大致方案： # 1. 使用ZooKeeper监控时间变化 ZooKeeper可以用来在分布式系统中的不同节点上维护和同步数据，包括时间戳信息。每个生成ID的节点在生成ID之前，都可以通过ZooKeeper获取当前的全局时间戳。可以设计这样的逻辑： - 每个节点生成ID前先检查本地时间是否比ZooKeeper中记录的上一次时间戳还早（即检查是否发生时钟回拨）。 - 如果本地时间早于ZooKeeper记录的时间戳，说明可能发生了时钟回拨。此时，可以暂停ID生成，等待直到本地时间追上ZooKeeper记录的时间。 - 在每次生成ID后，更新ZooKeeper中的时间戳为最新值。 # 2. ZooKeeper作为时间戳的权威来源 在分布式系统中使用ZooKeeper维护当前的时间戳，所有需要生成唯一ID的节点都基于ZooKeeper给出的时间戳来生成ID。这样可以在一定程度上避免因某个节点的时钟回拨而导致ID冲突： - 当节点启动时，从ZooKeeper获取当前的公认时间戳。 - 使用这个时间戳作为雪花算法的时间部分，确保生成的ID具有全局唯一性。 # 3. 使用逻辑时钟代替物理时钟 在某些方案中，如果物理时钟不可靠（例如，可能出现时钟回拨），可以使用逻辑时钟（例如ZooKeeper上的顺序节点）来生成唯一标识符中的时间戳部分。这种方法牺牲了ID中时间信息的准确性，但在确保ID全局唯一性方面是有效的。 # 注意事项 - 确保ZooKeeper集群自身具有高可用性和时间同步，以防ZooKeeper成为单点故障。 - 这种方法可能会对ZooKeeper集群造成额外的负载，尤其是在ID生成请求较多的情况下，因此应考虑对性能影响的评估。 解决雪花算法时钟回拨问题的根本目标是确保不同节点上的时间戳的一致性和单调递增性。使用ZooKeeper作为全局时间戳的权威来源，可以帮助分布式系统中的各个节点在生成唯一ID时保持时间的一致性，最小化时钟回拨的影响。"},{"prompt":"请根据A股的开市时间，计算A股一天有几根5分钟的K线","completion":"A股市场的交易时间分为上午和下午两个阶段，具体为： - 上午开市时间：9:30 - 11:30 - 下午开市时间：13:00 - 15:00 上午交易时段共2小时，下午交易时段共2小时，合计4小时。 一根5分钟的K线覆盖5分钟的交易数据，要计算一天中有多少根5分钟的K线，我们需要将每个交易时段的总时长除以5分钟。具体计算方法如下： - 每小时有60分钟，所以一个交易时段有60分钟/5分钟 = 12根K线 - 上午有2小时，所以上午有2 * 12 = 24根K线 - 下午同样有2小时，所以下午也有2 * 12 = 24根K线 综合一天的交易时段，一天总共有24根 + 24根 = 48根5分钟的K线。 因此，根据A股交易时间，一天中总共会有48根5分钟的K线。"},{"prompt":"为什么yahoo给出50根K线，我看了一下，它列出了9:30和13:00的K线，我不知道是哪里来的，正常是从9:35和13:05开始计算吧","completion":"您对于K线的统计方法提出了一个好观点。在不同的交易系统或数据提供方中，5分钟K线的计算方式可能有所不同。常见的两种方式包括： 1. **从开市时刻开始计算**：这种方法从9:30和13:00开始，每过5分钟计算一根K线。这种方式下，9:30-9:34会形成第一根5分钟K线，随后是9:35-9:39的K线，以此类推。按照这种统计方法，确实会在每个交易时段的开始（9:30和13:00）形成一根K线，这与您观察到的Yahoo!财经给出的50根K线相吻合。 2. **从开市后第一个5分钟整数时刻开始计算**：按照这种方式，首个5分钟K线的统计是从9:35开始的，然后是9:40、9:45等等，对于下午时段则是从13:05开始。这种计算方式虽然每个交易时段的首个K线数据可能会较少（因为包含的时间少于5分钟），但是它确保了每根K线都覆盖完整的5分钟数据。 由于实际上9:30-9:34和13:00-13:04的K线也包含了市场上的交易信息，包括这些K线能够提供更全面的交易数据视角，这可能是Yahoo!财经选择包括开市时刻K线的原因之一。此外，考虑到交易的开盘和午盘开市可能会有大量的交易活动和价格波动，这些时间点的数据对于投资者分析市场情绪十分重要。 总的来说，具体采用哪种计算方式可能取决于数据提供方的选择或者投资者的分析习惯。您提到的两种方式都有它们各自的逻辑和优点。对于投资者或分析师而言，重要的是理解所使用数据的生成方式，并在此基础上进行一致的市场分析。"},{"prompt":"我的问题是为什么yahoo会给出50根K线，多出来的那十分钟是哪里来的","completion":"对于为什么Yahoo财经提供的是50根5分钟K线，这实际上可能涉及到A股开盘前的集合竞价期间。 在A股市场，除了正常的交易时段之外，还有一个重要的交易时段是**开盘前的集合竞价**： - 上午的集合竞价时段是从9:15到9:25，然后9:25到9:30是为开盘做准备的阶段，9:30才是正式开市。 - 下午没有集合竞价，直接在13:00开市。 如果Yahoo财经在其统计中将上午的9:15到9:30的数据视为单独的一根或多根K线（取决于它们如何处理这段时间的数据），加上本来的48根K线，这就可以解释为什么会出现50根K线的情况。 具体来说： - 如果将9:15-9:30视为一个完整的5分钟K线周期，那么早盘可能额外增加3根K线（9:15-9:20, 9:20-9:25, 9:25-9:30）。 - 但根据您的描述，看起来Yahoo财经可能只是将9:30单独作为一根K线，而不是分开计算集合竞价期间的K线。 这样： - 上午9:30和下午13:00开盘分别会被视作单独的K线（如果真的如此处理，则每个开盘时刻都算作一根K线），加上正常的48根（9:30-11:30和13:00-15:00每半小时6根K线，共48根），确实会得出50根K线。 这个计算方式与投资者和交易系统希望如何视角这些数据有关，不同的数据提供商可能会有不同的处理逻辑。但是一般而言，开盘前的集合竞价数据对于分析市场情绪确实是重要的，也可以解释为什么包括这些数据对有些用户可能是有价值的。 这一说明只是一个可能的解释。具体到Yahoo财经的实际处理逻辑，最准确的解释应该来自其官方文档或用户支持。"},{"prompt":"obsidian 有没有分词搜索插件","completion":"截至我最后更新的信息（2023年），Obsidian官方插件库中并没有直接提供\\"分词搜索\\"功能的插件。Obsidian的搜索功能比较基础，主要提供了对文档内容的全文搜索能力，包括对标签、链接等的搜索，但没有提供类似于中文分词这样的高级文本处理功能。 # 解决方法 尽管没有直接的分词搜索插件，你可以通过以下方式来增强Obsidian中的搜索体验： 1. **使用正则表达式搜索**：Obsidian支持使用正则表达式进行搜索，这可以在一定程度上提高搜索的灵活性和准确度，尤其是在处理多种模式或形式相似的查询时。 2. **利用标签和链接**：通过在文档中合理使用标签（tags）和链接（links），可以提高特定内容的可检索性。虽然这不是分词搜索，但可以作为组织文档和提高搜索效率的一个方法。 3. **第三方文本处理工具**：如果需要高级的文本处理，如中文分词，你可以考虑先利用第三方工具对内容进行预处理，再导入Obsidian。例如，可以使用专门的分词软件或脚本对中文文档进行分词，然后将分词结果以某种形式（例如标签）加入到文档中。 4. **社区插件和自定义开发**：Obsidian的社区非常活跃，新的插件不断开发并发布。你可以关注社区论坛和GitHub上的Obsidian插件库，看看是否有新的插件支持类似的功能。此外，如果你有编程技能，Obsidian支持自定义插件的开发，你可以尝试自己开发一个满足需求的插件。 # 结论 虽然Obsidian本身或其官方插件库可能没有直接提供分词搜索功能，但通过上述方法和外部工具，你还是可以增强Obsidian在处理复杂文本搜索方面的能力。同时，考虑到Obsidian社区的活跃性，未来可能会有更多支持类似功能的插件出现。"},{"prompt":"ElasticPress可以配置中文断词器吗","completion":"是的，ElasticPress，作为Elasticsearch在WordPress中的集成插件，可以通过配置Elasticsearch来使用中文分词器。Elasticsearch本身支持多种分词器，包括为中文专门设计的分词器，比如IK分词器、中文分词器（Chinese Analyzer）、以及其他第三方中文分词插件。 ElasticPress通过将WordPress的数据同步到Elasticsearch并使用其强大的搜索功能，从而改善了搜索效率和结果的相关性。要为ElasticPress配置中文断词器，实质上是在Elasticsearch中进行配置，然后让ElasticPress利用这些设置。 # 如何配置中文分词器 以下是配置中文分词器的一般步骤： 1. **选择中文分词器**：您首先需要选择一个适合您需求的中文分词器。IK分词器是一个流行的选择，它提供了两种分词模式：精确模式和智能模式，适用于不同的分词需求。 2. **安装分词器插件**：以IK分词器为例，您需要在Elasticsearch中安装此插件。通常，安装分词器插件的命令如下（以特定版本的Elasticsearch为例）： ```bash ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik/releases/download/vx.x.x/elasticsearch-analysis-ik-x.x.x.zip ``` 安装后，您可能需要重启Elasticsearch服务。 3. **配置Elasticsearch以使用分词器**：安装了中文分词器插件之后，您需要在Elasticsearch的索引设置中配置它。这通常通过PUT或POST请求到Elasticsearch的API来完成，如下面的示例展示了如何为一个索引配置IK分词器： ```json PUT /your_index { \\"settings\\": { \\"analysis\\": { \\"analyzer\\": { \\"default\\": { \\"tokenizer\\": \\"ik_max_word\\" } } } } } ``` 4. **配置ElasticPress**：基本上，安装和配置好Elasticsearch中的中文分词器后，ElasticPress会自动利用这些设置，因为ElasticPress的搜索是基于Elasticsearch的。不过，确保ElasticPress正确连接到了配置了中文分词器的Elasticsearch实例上。 # 注意事项 - 确保分词器的版本与您的Elasticsearch版本兼容。 - 在实际部署前，针对您的具体数据和查询需求测试所选择的分词器效果。 配置了中文分词器后，ElasticPress的中文搜索能力将大幅提升，从而改善了中文内容的搜索精准度和用户体验。"},{"prompt":"可否通过修改配置直接支持IK分词： version: \'3\' services: wordpress: image: wordpress:latest ports: -

`pageNumber` 是基于0开始的，也就是说，第一页是0。 - `page.getTotalPages()` 返回的是总页数，从1开始计算。如果总共有3页数据，`getTotalPages()` 将返回3。 因此，正确的循环停止条件应该是 `pageNumber < page.getTotalPages()`，因为当`pageNumber`增长到与总页数相等（例如，总页数是3，有效的页码应该是0、1、2）的时候，循环应该停止，没有更多的页需要查询了。 所以，你的循环可能应该被修正为： ```java pageNumber = 0; page = null; // 当前累积的DTO数量还没达到需求且还有页可供查询时继续循环 while (kHashDtoList.size() < size && (Objects.isNull(page) || pageNumber < page.getTotalPages())) { page = findHash24ByRealHash24InSort(realHash48, PageRequest.of(pageNumber++, size)); kHashDtoList.addAll(page.toList()); } ``` 这样就能确保：每次循环在检查是否还有更多的页可以查询时，会正确地遵循页码和总页数的约定。"},{"prompt":"0对任何数字取余都是0吗","completion":"实际上，对于“0对任何数字取余”的问题，描述有些混淆。在数学和大多数编程语言中，将任何非零数字除以0是未定义的，因为除以0在数学上没有意义，会导致一个错误或异常。因此，我们不能说“0对任何数字取余都是0”，因为这种操作本身就是不合法的。 **如果你的意思是“任何数字对0取余”，那在大多数编程语言中，这会导致一个错误或异常。**例如，在Java或Python中尝试这样的操作会抛出除以零的错误。 -

Without the specific context in which this statement was made, I\'ll offer a general explanation. \\"The Legend of Korra\\" is a sequel to the highly successful \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" and has been praised for its sophisticated storytelling, character development, and animation. Korra, the protagonist, is the next Avatar following Aang, and Asami Sato is a skilled engineer and pilot. Over the course of the series, both characters become close friends, and in the series finale, it is implied they have romantic feelings for each other. This conclusion was groundbreaking at the time for its representation of a same-sex couple in a mainstream American children\'s animated series. The phrase you mentioned could be interpreted in a few ways, depending on the speaker\'s intention: 1. **Critiquing character development or storyline handling**: The phrase might express disappointment or critique regarding how the relationship between Korra and Asami was developed. Some fans felt that their relationship was not given enough screen time or development to feel fully realized, or that it seemed rushed or came out of nowhere due to the constraints of broadcasting standards and practices at the time. 2. **Comment on fan expectations**: It could also refer to how the expectations of the fanbase were managed. Some fans might have felt that the buildup to their relationship was mishandled or that there were missed opportunities to explore their dynamic more deeply throughout the series. 3. **Issues with representation**: The statement might also touch on broader issues of LGBTQ+ representation in media, suggesting that while the series took a significant step forward, there were still limitations and obstacles in how Korra and Asami\'s relationship was portrayed. Some might argue that the series did not go far enough, fumbling the chance to more explicitly address and explore the characters\' sexuality and relationship due to the time it was produced. 4. **Fandom dynamics**: Finally, it could reflect on how different segments of the fan community reacted to Korra and Asami\'s relationship, with some fully embracing it and others being critical or dismissive. The phrase might suggest that the show creators had the opportunity to do something unique with both characters but didn\'t meet every fan\'s expectations, leading to division or disappointment. Regardless of the interpretation, it\'s clear that Korra and Asami\'s relationship stands as a significant moment in animation history for its representation of a same-sex couple.

Applied metaphorically to the narrative or character development of Korra and Asami in \\"The Legend of Korra,\\" the word \\"fumble\\" suggests a mishandling or missed opportunity by the creators or writers. The speaker might be implying that the development of Korra and Asami\'s relationship—or certain aspects of their individual character arcs—was not executed as effectively or thoughtfully as it could have been. This could reference a belief that their relationship wasn\'t given enough depth, screen time, or prior development to fully satisfy fan expectations, or that it was not explored with the nuance and attention it deserved due to various constraints, such as time, network policies, or cultural considerations at the time of the show\'s airing.

The sun dips low, casting a golden hue over a sprawling bog that whispers tales of old. There, standing waist-deep in the murky waters, is a figure so delicately androgynous, they seem to be a living embodiment of the region\'s magical realism. This Slavic twink, a vision of ambiguous beauty, boasts physical attributes that defy conventional categorization. His hair, long and lustrous, cascades down in waves that catch the dying light, framing a face so angelic and symmetrical that it becomes the subject of local sonnets. His skin, fair and unblemished, contrasts sharply with the dark, primordial muck of the bog. The water\'s embrace highlights his physique - puffy pecs and wide hips that sew a tapestry of confusion in the minds of those who dare categorize beauty. His butt, a curvature so perfect, it could have been sculpted by the hands of ancient Slavic gods, only adds to the bewildering allure. As our protagonist goes about his ablutions, washing under his arms with a carefree zest, a moment of unbridled naturalism unfolds. There, in the heart of Eastern Europe\'s wilderness, he lets out a fart. Not just any fart, but a minute-long sonic adventure that ripples through the bog, a celebration of human nature in its most raw form. The sound, a symphony of defiance against societal norms, rolls over the waters, disturbing the peace and, rather unexpectedly, the local aquatic life. His face, a picture of blissful relief, ripples with the joy of emancipation from restraint, a stark, unapologetic statement of being. In the comedic crescendo of this natural concert, several fish float to the surface, casualties of the olfactory onslaught. Yet, our twink sees opportunity in the midst of this unusual harvest. With a grace that belies his peculiar situation, he plucks a fish from the water, contemplating dinner. It\'s a moment so outlandishly grounding, it would force a giggle from even the sternest of souls. Just when the audience might be teetering on the edge of believing they\'ve stumbled into a scene from a fairy tale, the twink opens his mouth to speak. His voice, a surprising baritone that seems at odds with his ethereal appearance, shatters any lingering illusions. It\'s a rich, velvety sound that fills the bog, echoing off the trees and water, ensuring there\'s no mistaking his male identity. This scene, a delightful confusion of senses and sensibilities, feels almost like a metaphor for the Eastern European soul: deeply rooted in the earth yet always fluttering towards some ineffable, mystical horizon.

Because behaviour control and conflict resolution are from the perspective of systems theory at most performances for which social equivalents exist in other systems, controlling interventions are questionable for Luhmann. If one wants to explain the specificity of law, they cannot be used without expanding the concept of function to such an extent that it becomes imprecise. Therefore Luhmann is profoundly sceptical of any attempt ‘to salvage the assumption that there is a social steering through law no matter how limited it is (instead of the self-steering only of the legal system)’.82 In this way he differs, amongst others, also from Teubner’s concept of reflexive law?3 Teubner does not want to resign himself to a mere self-referentiality of systems and is looking for ways out of the dilemma of systemic anarchy. For him reflexive law has a normative and analytical dual character, for reflection in law means ‘both empirical analysis and normative evaluation’84 Teubner attempts to implant a normative concept within systems theory which is purely descriptive. This seems justifiable, because within the legal system both dogmatic and legal-theoretical self-reflection are crucial for its reproduction. In doing so he has a decentralised model of reflection in mind, which does not lose the perspective on the ‘environment’, but transfers it into the subsystems. He thus adopts Luhmann’s position in so far as he admits that there can be no control centre. Instead Teubner relies on the one hand on the potential for reflection within the system, and on the other hand on the connection of systems. The versions of this concept vary over the course of his work, but the principle remains. In 1982 he explains in his conception of reflexive law that it has to develop norms for procedures which can serve other social systems as premises for democratic self-organisation and self-regulation. It shall not determine the functions of other social systems in an authoritative manner, but ‘foster mechanisms that systematically further the development of reflexion structures within other social subsystems’33 Teubner goes on to look for those principles which can make a coupling of systems possible. This is at the crux of his foundational work of legal theory, published in 1989. Here he critiques Luhmann’s version, writing that the lat- ter is blind to connections across multiple systems. In consequence systems are isolated, and it is no longer possible to conceive of the over-determination of an event.86 Teubner counters this with the concept of ‘interference’, which emphasises superpositions and overlaps. The legal system is thus genuinely connected with its social environments. Interferences form a bridge that couples the systems through one and the same communicative event, because they use the same ‘raw material’, that is sense, and they all use, be it in one specialised form or another, communications. Each specialised communication in any social subsystem is always at the same time a communication within overall society, so that the subsystems draw elements from the societal communication flow for their specialist communications: ‘If this is the case, then it follows that subsystemic and societal elements coincide in a single act of communication. In this way law and society are still linked together’87 Interfering systems do not offer each other unorganised complexity, but pre-ordered complexity.88 Law can therefore regulate society in a limited way by regulating itself,89 because it becomes reflexive in such a way that it adapts its norms and procedures to the social situation and designs ordering procedures for the protagonists.90 Direct interventions are actually not possible; rather what we find is indirect control through self-control.91 In Teubner’s most recent analyses, which are concerned with the trans-nationalisation of law, the problem of systemic autonomisation multiplies because of the ‘fragmentation of global society’. For now one is no longer only confronted with systems, but also with sectorial regulating regimes of laws.92 The overlapping of two different principles, the territorial segmented and the thematic-functional differentiation, leads to regimes which do not follow an unambiguous logic. Through historical coincidences the functional systems trigger conflicts, scandals and irritations in the legal system, which are answered with the emergence of a non-bilateral regime of rights that crystallises at the point of conflict. Despite the advanced fragmentation, Teubner, together with Fischer-Les- cano, looks for mechanisms of connection between regimes. A starting point can be found in the development of independent secondary standardisations, that is procedural norms about the formation of laws, legal knowledge and legal sanctioning. In this way a mechanism develops which connects reflexive processes of law with reflexive processes of other social spheres, ‘autoconstitutional regimes’.93 Those ‘inter-systemic linking institutions’ connect occasionally. It is, however, not enough to register and accept factual developments, ‘[T]hat would ultimately mean to accept the shortcomings of existing networks in regard to theories of democracy’94 If one does not want to contribute to the ‘justification of a questionable project’, this description has to be completed with a normative concept of networks. For this, the approach of self-regulation is again used: social rationality, now on a global level, can only be located in the regimes themselves, which have to reflect on other interests and the common good. 3 Critique Luhmann’s systems theory is still heavily criticised by proponents of critical theory. Thus Jürgen Habermas attacked Luhmann’s systems theory as ‘the height of technocratic consciousness’, ‘which today allows us to define practical questions from the outset as technical and to thereby remove them from public and open discussion’95 Alex Demirovic similarly considers Luhmann a systems thinker, only concerned with the preservation of the system and its order96 His theory represents a great challenge for the enlightenment tradition and for the social critique that follows it, ‘because he dismisses as obsolete exactly this limited humanist model of emancipation and the critique it implies, even critique and emancipation as such’97 It must, however, be recognised that the systems theory of law does not only represent a provocation with regards to critical, but also to traditional theories of law. Like Habermas, Luhmann is also influenced by the linguistic turn;98 this is not least visible in the turn from structures to processes, and from recognition to construction, as well as finally in the way paradoxes are dealt with. Furthermore, one can note that also within the paradigm of systems theory, advanced and apologetic approaches and moments compete with one another. In particular Teubner’s variations can be considered ‘critical systems theory’, as will be shown in the confrontation with the subject in Section 3.2. My thesis is that the systems theory approach describes the way social relations become independent as ‘systems’ - or expressed in terms of value theory: as social forms - rather accurately. The fascination of the theory consists precisely in that it distances itself from common sense (the ‘observation of the first order’) and names the reification of social relations. Systems theory ‘speaks’, one could say pointedly, from inside the legal form, by theoretically reformulating the reified procedures. In doing so, however, several difficulties emerge. 3.1 The New Europe or Switching the Mode of Description (Legal-)systems theory and its description of modern society follows the soci-ological tradition of Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and Georg Simmel,99 and develops somewhat self-evidently from it. However, its way of doing ‘truth politics’ begins with the suggestion that it overturns all conventions that were previously considered certain. Luhmann primarily manages to create this impression by starting his theory at a high level of abstraction. He exponentially increases the problematic characteristics of general concepts, which subsume many different elements and thus unify them according to a logic of identity. By doing so he is able to illuminate fundamental structural principles from the particular perspective of autonomy. At this level of abstraction, he can ‘switch’ the mode of description in such a way that other concepts in legal theory appear comparatively ‘lacking in complexity’. A risk of this strategy is however that the non-identical, the particular, is ‘invisibilised’ to such a degree that it becomes buried under the rocks of identity. A closer inspection, however, shows that Luhmann argues in a manner that is far less ‘New European’ than his ‘air of a superior analytical perspective’100 would appear to suggest. It would therefore require too much effort to attempt to ‘expose’ Luhmann’s conception of the autonomy of law as illusory,101 because in principle Luhmann ‘confesses’ to everything in his texts. An example is the determination of the function’s content: the counter-factual securing of expectations, which can make the connection of operations in a genuinely insecure future possible. What is Luhmann’s theory doing here, other than representing the theory of ‘legal certainty’ in new terms? By seemingly creating a counter-position to the ‘social function’ of the law, he ultimately nonetheless falls back on a familiar notion, namely - in the words of Franz Neumann - the insight that formal law is ‘necessary as a pre-condition of capitalist competition .for calculability and dependability in the legal system’.102 Besides, if the law is highly indeterminate until it is applied (the paradox), what then can the normatively expecting person really be so certain about? Similar considerations apply to the thesis of the legal system’s operative closedness, which is Luhmann’s core premise. While Teubner shows from the outset that for him this is a matter of the legal system’s own dynamism, Luhmann’s descriptive mode appears to sketch an autistic planet. Upon closer inspection, however, this planet is reduced to a communication system which only reproduces law through its own language, so that all moments extrinsic to law have to be translated. It really is, similar to materialist approaches, a reflexive process, wherein the practised relations are developed into the legal norms of a legal order.W3 Thus, for example, the practice of exchange is translated into a contractual relationship, the attribution and visibilisation of land ownership as a mortgage, etc. Moreover, Luhmann concedes, apparently quite incidentally, a kind of ‘relative autonomy’, when he explains that law needs to have sufficient prospects of being enforced as otherwise one would after all bow to the facts and not the norms. Here the enforcement depends not least on ‘the use of physical force’ of the ‘political system’.W4 What is the central theoretical difference to the ‘Old European’ Max Weber and his postulate of the state’s monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force? 3.2 Dualism of Subject and Society ‘The objection that systems theory marginalises the human individual in relation to society ...’W5 - this is how Teubner describes the critics’ persistent misunderstanding: the ‘successful narrative of the “lack of reference to actors” in systems theory’.W6 Firstly, one has to note that the existence of individuals is actually not denied in systems theory; human subjects are ‘a necessary environmental precondition for social events’,W7 they are as such no less important for the system than the system itself.108 What is important, however, is how ‘human subjects’ appear in systems theory, and it is precisely at this juncture that reflections in systems theory take an unusual path with regards to the strategies of the theory, for they dissect the unified subjects into three moments: a ‘body-soul unit’, as well as into ‘organic life and psychic experience’^9 that is to say, into a structurally coupled whole consisting of biological and psychic systems. This whole is only constructed internally during social communication as an individual. Consciousnesses and bodies are therefore ‘living, pulsing units in the communication environment’. Something ‘extra-communicative’ is modelled within law. Communication artefacts are then attributed to actions.110 Thus, and this is important to Teubner precisely for ‘humanist’ reasons, there exists a dualism of human thought, on the one hand, and social communication, on the other.111 For a naive equivalence of semantic artefacts and concrete human subjects would be fatal, precisely because it wrongs the latter. Communication is always a social alienation and attribution.”翻译为中文","completion":"2.3 规范自我规制 然而，Teubner对法律系统理论的决定性“修正”在于，尝试以一种与Luhmann相反的方式概念化系统，使其保持对民主理论反思的开放性。 因为从系统理论的视角看，行为控制和冲突解决最多是社会在其他系统中存在的等效表现，所以对于Luhmann来说，控制干预是有问题的。如果想解释法律的特殊性，不能在不将功能概念扩展到变得不精确的程度上使用它们。因此，Luhmann对任何尝试“挽救法律通过社会引导的假设，无论限制有多大（而不仅仅是法律系统的自我引导）”持深度怀疑态度。这一点上，他在其他方面也不同于Teubner的反射性法律概念。Teubner不想仅仅屈服于系统的自我指涉性，并在系统性无政府状态的困境中寻找出路。对他来说，反射性法律具有规范性和分析性双重特征，因为法律中的反思意味着“既是实证分析也是规范性评价” Teubner试图在纯描述性的系统理论中植入一个规范性概念。这似乎是合理的，因为在法律系统内部，法学教条和法理学的自我反思对其再生产至关重要。在这样做时，他考虑到了一种不失去对“环境”的视角，而将其转移到子系统中的分散反思模型。因此，他在某种程度上采纳了Luhmann的立场，承认没有控制中心。相反，Teubner一方面依赖于系统内部的反思潜力，另一方面依赖于系统之间的连接。他的这一概念的版本在他的作品中有所变化，但原则保持不变。在1982年，他在其反射性法律的概念中解释说，它必须为能够为其他社会系统提供民主自组织和自我规制前提的程序开发规范。它不应以权威性的方式决定其他社会系统的功能，而是“促进系统性推动其他社会子系统内反射结构发展的机制” Teubner继续寻找可以使系统耦合的原则。这是他1989年出版的法理学基础作品的核心。在这里，他批评了Luhmann的版本，写道后者对多个系统之间的连接视而不见。因此，系统被孤立，不再可能构想一个事件的过度决定。Teubner用“干扰”概念进行反驳，强调叠加和重叠。法律系统因此与其社会环境真正连接。干扰形成了一座桥梁，通过同一通信事件将系统耦合在一起，因为它们使用相同的“原材料”，即意义，并且它们都使用通信，无论是以一种专业化的形式还是另一种形式。任何社会子系统中的每一种专业化通信，都同时是整个社会中的一次通信，因此子系统为其专家通信从社会通信流中汲取元素：“如果是这样，那么就意味着子系统和社会元素在单一的通信行为中合而为一。这样，法律和社会仍然联系在一起”。干预系统不是提供彼此未组织的复杂性，而是预先排序的复杂性。因此，法律可以通过自我调节在有限的范围内规范社会，因为它以这样一种方式变得反射性，即它适应社会情况，修改其规范和程序，并为参与者设计排序程序。实际上不可能进行直接干预；我们发现的是通过自控实现的间接控制。 Teubner在最近的分析中关注法律的跨国化，系统自我自治的问题因“全球社会的碎片化”而倍增，因为现在不仅仅面临系统的挑战，还面临法律的部门化调节机制。两个不同原则的重叠，即领土分割原则和主题功能性差异化原则，导致了不遵循明确逻辑的制度。通过历史巧合，功能系统在法律系统中引发冲突、丑闻和刺激，这些通过在冲突点上形成非双边权利制度的出现得到回应。 尽管存在高度碎片化，Teubner与Fischer-Lescano一起寻找连接制度的机制。一个起点可以在独立的二级标准化的发展中找到，即关于法律形成、法律知识和法律制裁的程序规范。这样，就形成了一种机制，将法律的反射过程与其他社会领域的反射过程相连接，“自宪制度”。这些“跨系统连接机构”偶尔连接。然而，仅仅注册和接受事实发展是不够的，“[这]最终意味着接受现有网络在民主理论方面的缺陷”。如果不想为“一个值得怀疑的项目的正当化”做出贡献，这种描述必须用网络的规范性概念来补充。因此，再次使用自我调节的方法：社会合理性，现在在全球层面上，只能定位在本身必须反思其他利益和共同利益的制度中。 3 批评 Luhmann的系统理论依然受到批判理论支持者的强烈批评。因此，Jürgen Habermas攻击Luhmann的系统理论为“技术官僚意识的巅峰”，“它今天使我们能够从一开始就将实践问题定义为技术问题，从而将它们从公开和开放的讨论中移除”。Alex Demirovic同样认为Luhmann只关心系统的维护和其秩序的系统思想家，他的理论对启蒙传统和随之而来的社会批判构成了巨大的挑战，“因为他正是对这一有限的人文主义解放模型及其所含的批判，甚至批判和解放本身，声明为过时”。 然而，必须认识到，法律系统理论不仅对批判理论构成挑衅，对传统的法律理论也是如此。像Habermas一样，Luhmann也受到语言转向的影响；这不仅仅体现在从结构到过程、从认识到构建的转变上，也体现在处理悖论的方式上。此外，可以注意到，即使在系统理论的范式内，也有先进和辩护的方法和时刻相互竞争。特别是，Teubner的变体可以被认为是“批判性系统理论”，正如第3.2节中与主题的对抗将展示的。 我的论点是，系统理论方法精确地描述了社会关系如何独立为“系统”——或用价值理论的术语表达：作为社会形式。这一理论的魅力在于它与常识（“一级观察”）保持距离，并命名了社会关系的物化。可以尖锐地说，系统理论“从法律形式内部发言”，通过理论重塑物化程序。然而，在这样做的过程中，出现了几个困难。 3.1 新欧洲或描述方式的转变 （法律）系统理论及其对现代社会的描述遵循了Karl Marx、Max Weber、Emile Durkheim和Georg Simmel的社会学传统，并从中自然发展而来。然而，它进行“真理政治”的方式始于建议它推翻了以前被视为确定的所有惯例。Luhmann首先通过在高度抽象的水平上开始他的理论来营造这种印象。他将一般概念的问题特征成倍增加，这些概念总结了许多不同的元素，从而根据身份逻辑将它们统一起来。通过这样做，他能够从自治的特定视角照亮根本的结构原则。在这种抽象水平上，他可以以这样一种方式“转换”描述方式，使得法律理论中的其他概念相比之下显得“缺乏复杂性”。这种策略的一个风险是，非同一性、特殊性在如此程度上被“隐形化”，以至于它们被埋在身份的石头下。 然而，仔细检查表明，Luhmann的论证方式远不如他的“优越分析视角”的气氛所暗示的那样“新欧洲”。 因此，试图将Luhmann对法律自主性概念的“揭露”为虚幻，需要付出太多努力，因为原则上Luhmann在他的文本中“承认”了一切。一个例子是函数内容的确定：反事实地保障期望，这可以使得在根本不确定的未来中连接操作成为可能。Luhmann的理论在这里做了什么，不过是用新的术语表达了“法律确定性”的理论吗？通过看似创建一个与法律的“社会功能”相对立的立场，他最终还是回到了一个熟悉的概念，即用Franz Neumann的话说，正是对形式法律作为资本主义竞争的前提所必需————为了在法律体系中的可计算性和可靠性的见解。 此外，如果法律在应用之前高度不确定（悖论），那么，规范性期待的人真的可以确定些什么呢？ 类似的考虑也适用于法律系统操作封闭性的论点，这是Luhmann的核心前提。而Teubner从一开始就表明，对他来说，这是法律系统自身动态的问题，Luhmann的描述模式似乎描绘了一个自闭的星球。然而，经过仔细检查，这个星球被缩小为一个仅通过其自身语言再生法律的通信系统，因此所有与法律无关的时刻都必须被翻译。它确实是，类似于唯物主义方法，一个反射过程，其中练习的关系被发展成法律秩序的法律规范。因此，例如，交换实践被翻译成合同关系，土地所有权的归属和可视化被视为抵押等。 此外，Luhmann似乎偶然地承认了一种“相对自主性”，当他解释说法律需要有足够的执行前景，否则人们会毕竟屈服于事实而不是规范。在这里，执行不仅仅取决于“政治系统”的“物理力量”的使用。 与“旧欧洲”的Max Weber及其国家垄断合法使用物理力量的假设的中心理论差异是什么呢？ 3.2 主体与社会的二元论 “系统理论将人类个体相对于社会边缘化的指责……”——这就是Teubner描述批评者持续的误解：“系统理论中‘缺乏对行动者的指涉’的成功叙述”。 首先，必须注意，系统理论实际上并没有否认个体的存在；人类主体是“社会事件的必要环境前提”，它们对系统和系统本身同样重要。重要的是，如何在系统理论中出现“人类主体”，正是在这个关口，系统理论的反思采取了对理论策略而言不寻常的路径，因为它们将统一的主体分解为三个时刻：一个“身体-灵魂单元”，以及“有机生命和心理体验”，即，成为由生物和心理系统组成的结构耦合整体。这个整体只有在社会通信过程中内部构建为个体。因而，意识和身体是通信环境中的“活生生的，搏动的单位”。法律内部模型化了一些“超通信”的东西。然后，通信工件被归因于行动。因此，对Teubner来说重要的是，出于“人文主义”原因，人类思想与社会通信之间存在一种二元论，因为将语义工件和具体的人类主体等同起来将是灾难性的，正是因为它误解了后者。通信总是一种社会异化和归属。"},{"prompt":"请将“This leads to a further reflection, namely to one on the relationship of com-munication and consciousnesses or psychic systems. The communication theorem itself is based upon the premise of the radical individuality of psychic systems.112 Because consciousnesses are opaque for one another, the functional necessity for the emergence of communication arises.n3 Communication is thus the basic articulating unit of a double contingency.n4 But this communication takes on a life of its own with regards to the individual consciousnesses - that is also the reason why ‘concrete human subjects’ and communicatively constructed persons must not be equated. ‘Psychic systems’ only participate in communication without creating it, precisely because communication has become self-referentially independent with regards to those individuals; in its ‘emerging order’ the psychic merely enters:n5 That human subjects are not part of society, but face it in insurmountable separation, has an inexorable consequence. Society and conscious- ness/body are for each other communicatively unreachable. The latter are respectively independent, self-sustaining (psychic or organic) processes. Although both have created communication, they cannot master it. Com-munication becomes independent of the human subject and creates with regards to individual consciousness its own world of meaning.116 Although Teubner assumes, with Luhmann, that functional differentiation rep-resents social progress, he nonetheless considers as one of the main dangers of modern societies those independent communication processes which he calls, in order to underline the issue, the ‘anonymous matrix’. The matrix of the economic system, for example, could attack and even destroy human existence. Thus ‘sweatshops’ are a consequence of ‘anonymous market forces’. Against this, resistance - which has to be adequately understood by an updated understanding of human rights - is directed: This is the space where bodies and consciousnesses of the individuals ... insist on their ‘pre-legal’, ‘pre-political’, and even ‘pre-social’ (extrasocial) ‘latent right of their own’. Bodily pain and psychic suffering have to emerge from their speechlessness by introducing the resistance of suffering bodies and souls, for instance in physical violence, as representations into communication^7 The representation of this most advanced position of system-theoretical legal theory shows that it absolutely does recognise actors, similarly to post-structuralism with its intention of decentering the autonomous subject.n8 In contrast to post-structuralist approaches, however, splitting the subject into three parts insists on something external to communication, on a separation of communication and ‘human subject’. Teubner does not defend a realist position, and for this reason bodies are, for example, not the ‘actual reality’ in his approach. However, he delineates a strict border between society on the one hand and ‘human subjects’ on the other. Different contexts are produced within their own respective borders. Although this dualism follows the intention to do justice to each respective logic, it leads to two theoretical problems, which ultimately explain the narration of blocking out subjects. On the one hand this approach remains despite its postmodern decentring within a traditional subject-paradigm. Foucault had rightly asserted against this idea that the human body was only constructed as a biological entity with the emergence of the modern natural sciences. In order to question the social construct of two sexes, feminist theorists have subsequently demonstrated that a dualism of biological gendered bodies and social gender identity amounts ultimately to a naturalisation of social conditions. The bodily gender must not be understood as ‘fundamental core or inert matter’ which is confronted with power (or here with communication), but as one of the first consequences of the gender dispositif.?19 And what is ‘sex’ anyway? Is it natural, anatomical, chromosomal, or hor-monal ... Are the ostensibly natural facts of sex discursively produced by various scientific discourses in the service of other political and social interests?i20 The body is accordingly no passive medium for which cultural meanings remain external, but itself a culturally generated product.121 In this respect there is neither a pre-social body nor a pre-social psyche, rephrased in terms of systems theory, there are only ‘subjects’. The systemic communications themselves produce that which to begin with they only claim to communicate. Legal subjectivation (as I will show later on following Foucault) coproduces the modern subject as real lived practice. Isolated consciousnesses, whose isolation precisely creates the necessity of communication, reveal themselves here as historically specific forms of human subjects and lose their character of anthropological foundation. On the other hand, the dualism of communication and consciousness inflates the independence of systems/matrix. It is a fitting observation that capitalist societies are marked by how ‘communication contexts become distant from their organic and psychic infrastructures, from human life and conscious- ness’.i22 But to deduce from this that human subjects are no longer part of society overextends the argument. It is their social (communicative) practices which first bring this society (communication) about. It is they - as Marx has shown - which become independent with regards to them. Thus, even their independent existences have to be reproduced every day in ordinary activities, they do not detach from them. It is not anonymous market forces that create the inhuman reality of ‘sweatshops’, but those who act strategically and assume the capitalist commodity form for themselves. While they have to take on their ‘laws’, they reproduce them in their actions by claiming them for their interests, or to the contrary, by massively questioning them. Thus, the systemic independ-ences have to pass through practice, and can be questioned and shifted/moved by it. It is therefore - as I will argue later on - not a question of dualism, but rather a duality123 of practice and its effects. The demarcation, the dualism, creates in sum antinomies on both sides, which then have to be broken up with enormous effort. Because society is ejected from the individual and the individuals from society, the theory does not focus on the strategic practice of social subjects. Legal systems theory no longer analyses it on this level.124 This creates the impression that systems theory is subjectless. From this perspective a class-based analysis, for instance, has to be considered as a false personification of systemic differentiations and rejected, in favour of demonstrating how strategies of classes or other social actors are mediated in systemic processes, have to base themselves upon them and at the same time create or shift them. Precisely this participation is always already assumed on the system level. How hegemonic communication projects actually assert themselves, and in which discursive conflicts, is blocked out: ‘Inasmuch as systems theory does not form any hypothesis here, it bases itself consistently on social facts, leaves the idle question of intentions open and focuses instead on communicative events’.^5 The demarcation produces a similar problem to that in Althusser’s structuralism, of ‘abstracting the agents, as if there were ... just “place”-holding phantoms’.i26 Elaborate studies of specific conflicts and the differentiation according to forces, factions and alliances become obsolete. Ultimately, however, the abstraction cannot be consistently sustained. For who programmes the code? Who advances differentiation globally? How are contingency and change (‘evolution’) to be explained? Therefore the justification for the ‘function’ of the legal system also remains contradictory; thus Luhmann certainly notes initially that he does not mean by ‘expectations’ that are to be stabilised the actual state of consciousness of a given individual, but only the temporal aspect of the meaning of communications.127 But his further explanations are orientated towards concrete subjects. ‘One’ could thus live better, ‘one’ would have to adapt, ‘one’ tries to prepare oneself for the future, etc. At least to establish plausibility he has to briefly set aside the strict separation of society and ‘human subjects’ at this point. Here evidently the thing itself asserts itself - against the author’s intention, similarly to Kant’s attempt to explain, unempirically, the transcendental subject that is relieved of all empiricism.128 3.3 The Grand Narrative‘System’ The unresolved problem of the actors surreptitiously sneaks back into the theory. Thus, there is notably at least one basic postulate of systems theory: ‘There are systems’. The discourse on the system itself is precisely not re-introduced in comparison to other, non-systemic subjects, but singularly occupies the summit of the pyramid of concepts.129 The following constructivist deduction only aims to demonstrate theoretical requirements to be able to speak of such a system, in this way: when operative closedness - then the system has to provide its own reproduction - then the legal operations have to connect with each other. What is demonstrated is ultimately a necessity of thinking. That is, the ‘grand narrative’ of systems theory is called ‘autopoietic system’. Thus, ironically, as Andreas Weber notes, ‘in subjectless systems theory a subject-logical thinking of a new, subtle kind persists..., that is in the absolutism of the autopoietic system’?30 Precisely this system should provide a guarantee for Luhmann against ultimate metaphysical explanations beyond the social. That autopoietic systems produce and reproduce their constitutive elements through their constitutive elements themselves, was precisely meant to cut off the connection to biologistic, ontological or religious premises. Yet this is countered in renouncing a genealogical deduction and implementing the system. Weber assumes that Luhmann intentionally ignores the problem, because he is primarily concerned with excluding the subject from the development of social theory.131 However, one has to assume that this forms his hidden normative premise. Before the autopoietic turn this was still readily apparent: ‘Our existence depends on functionally differentiated large scale systems of information processing’, he states.132 ‘Within them and through them we have to relate to the world’. Certainty only exists as long as they remain operational, and to secure precisely that is the role of law ‘and its order is the just’.133 Interestingly, Habermas and the legal systems theorists share this concept of the system, as will become apparent below. It can however already be shown at this point with Habermas’ critique of Teubner. He objects that the concept is inconsistent within the terms of the theory itself [theorieimmanent], for the common, that is macro-social communication, which all systems use in Teubner, is only objectively identical and precisely not from the perspective of one of the two systems. There is, according to the premises of systems theory, no observer’s position which can identify a communicative event as the same.134 Teubner’s suggestion therefore does not sit well with the conceptualisation of law as an autopoietic system; he is upon closer inspection more of an indication of the necessity of a theory of communicative action, ‘which distinguishes a “lifeworld” bound to the medium of ordinary language from “systems” steered through special codes yet adaptively open to the environment’.^5 Habermas thus believes that he ‘catches’ Teubner in already admitting underhandedly that the necessity of a general language refers to a medium which is not entirely systemic, but encompasses the systems. But this line of reasoning is in turn only necessary for Habermas because he conceives of the functional systems which are differentiated by special codes very similarly (even if for him they are environmentally open) - that is, in such a way that action is also stopped in them. Any possibility of communicative practice therefore has to be transferred into the ‘life world’ and its vernacular (see further details below). Both theories grant the systems a problematic subject character. For in this manner the reification of social conditions is explained rather plausibly on the operative level. Subsequently, however, those social conditions and their actors, between whom the relations exist, are abstracted. Because finally only the product of human action is ‘observed’, but no longer the practice itself; also the mode of description is reified, the system acts. In this way the impression that the systems are completely remote and impenetrable is created. 3.4 ‘Queer Observations’ - Society without Gender^\' As the theory spirits subjective practice away from society, it cannot conceive of gendering as a process that structures society. Thus, it is hardly surprising that gender relations are irrelevant in the great works of legal systems theory. The relationship of systems theory and gender studies is according to Ulrike Teubner one of mutual exclusion.137 A modest number of more recent approaches in gender studies shows that it is considered as a possible subject of discussion, and even relatively parallel to current discourse theory or interactionist feminist theoretical approaches^8 - making the fact that it is blocked out in legal systems theory all the more conspicuous.”翻译为中文","completion":"这引发了进一步的反思，即对通信与意识或心理系统之间关系的思考。通信定理本身基于心理系统彻底个体化的前提。因为意识对彼此是不透明的，因此产生了通信的功能性必要性。因此，通信是双重偶然性的基本表达单位。但是这种通信就个别意识而言具有了自己的生命——这也是为什么“具体的人类主体”和通过交流构建的人物不应等同的原因。“心理系统”仅参与交流而不创造它，正是因为交流已经相对于那些个体变得自我参照地独立；在其“新兴秩序”中，心理仅仅是参与： 人类主体不是社会的一部分，而是以不可逾越的分离面对社会，这有一个不可避免的后果。社会和意识/身体对彼此来说在交流上是无法达到的。后者分别是独立的、自给自足的（心理或有机的）过程。 尽管两者都创造了交流，但它们无法掌控它。交流变得独立于人类主体，并就个别意识创造了自己的意义世界。 尽管Teubner与Luhmann一样认为，功能分化代表社会进步，但他仍然认为现代社会的主要危险之一是他为了强调问题而称之为“匿名矩阵”的独立交流过程。例如，经济系统的矩阵可能攻击甚至破坏人类的生存。因此，“血汗工厂”是“匿名市场力量”的后果。反抗这一点的是——必须通过更新对人权的理解来适当理解的抵抗： 这是个人的身体和意识...坚持其“法前”、“政前”甚至“社前”（额外社会的）“固有权利”的领域。身体痛苦和心理痛苦必须通过将遭受痛苦的身体和灵魂的抵抗，例如以身体暴力的形式，作为代表引入交流中，从而打破它们的沉默 这种系统理论法学理论的最前沿立场的表述显示，它确实认可行动者，与后结构主义及其去中心化自主主体的意图类似。然而，与后结构主义方法不同的是，将主体分裂成三部分坚持通信之外的东西，坚持通信与“人类主体”的分离。Teubner并不捍卫现实主义立场，因此例如在他的方法中，身体不是“实际现实”。然而，他在社会一方和“人类主体”另一方之间划定了严格的界限。不同的背景在各自的边界内产生。尽管这种二元论遵循尊重各自逻辑的意图，但它导致了两个理论问题，这最终解释了排除主体的叙述。 一方面，尽管进行了后现代的去中心化，这种方法仍然停留在传统的主体范式之内。福柯正确地对抗这一观点，认为只有在现代自然科学出现时，人体才被构建为生物实体。为了质疑两性社会构建，女性主义理论家随后证明，生物性别的身体与社会性别身份的二元论最终归结为对社会状况的自然化。身体性别不应被理解为与权力（或在这里与交流）相对抗的“根本核心或惰性物质”，而是性别装置的首批结果之一。 “性别”到底是什么？它是自然的、解剖学的、染色体的还是荷尔蒙的……所谓的性别自然事实是否由服务于其他政治和社会利益的各种科学话语在话语上产生？ 因此，身体并不是一个被文化意义保持在外部的被动媒介，而是一个文化生成的产物。在这个意义上，既没有前社会的身体，也没有前社会的心理，用系统理论的术语来说，只有‘主体’。系统的交流本身产生它们最初只声称要交流的东西。 法律主体化（我稍后将根据福柯的观点展示）共同产生了作为真实生活实践的现代主体。孤立的意识，其孤立恰恰创造了交流的必要性，这里显示为人类主体的历史特定形式，并失去了人类学基础的特征。 另一方面，通信与意识的二元论夸大了系统/矩阵的独立性。一个合适的观察是，资本主义社会的特征是“交流语境与其有机和心理基础设施、人类生活和意识相距甚远”。但由此得出人类主体不再是社会的一部分的结论过于夸张了。正是它们的社会（交流）实践首先带来了这个社会（交流）。正如马克思所展示的，它们与它们相对独立。因此，即使它们的独立存在必须在日常活动中每天被重新生产，它们也没有与之分离。创造“血汗工厂”的不人道现实不是匿名市场力量，而是那些战略性行动并为自己采用资本主义商品形式的人。虽然他们必须接受它们的“法律”，但他们通过为自己的利益声张它们，或相反，通过大规模质疑它们，在行动中再现它们。 因此，系统的独立性必须通过实践，可以通过实践被质疑和移动/转移。因此，我稍后将争论的是，这不是一个二元论的问题，而是实践及其效应的二元性问题。 这种划界，这种二元论，总的来说在双方都创造了对立，然后必须付出巨大努力来打破它们。因为社会被从个体中剔除，个体从社会中剔除，理论不关注社会主体的战略实践。法律系统理论不再在这个层面上对其进行分析。这就造成了系统理论无主体的印象。从这个角度看，例如基于阶级的分析必须被视为系统差异化的错误人格化并被拒绝，以展示阶级或其他社会行动者的策略是如何在系统过程中被中介、必须依靠它们并同时创造或转移它们。正是这种参与在系统层面上总是被假定的。霸权交流项目实际上是如何主张自己的，以及在哪些话语冲突中，被屏蔽了：“因为系统理论在这里没有形成任何假设，它始终基于社会事实，留下了意图的空闲问题，并专注于交流事件”。"},{"prompt":"received this as mail \\"Good morning We, the specialists of Tuatara Games, would like to provide to you an option for embedding of our video materials as a pre-roll at the beginning or in the middle of your channel on the occasion of exit of our new game - BARE BUTT BOXING on Steam.

It is a document which reflects about how the research is conducted, the care that has been exercised throughout the study and the findings in a manner that can be utilised for decision-making. It is observed that executives are rarely interested in the methodology adopted by the researcher in the investigation; they are interested only in the final results. From their viewpoint, the research report is the written presentation which the executive see about a project carried out by the researcher but initiated by the decision maker (executive) and it conveys the information desired by the decision maker in an understandable form. Report writing is an art, which must be learnt through hard work, practice and effort. The information and recommendations placed before the management are of little value unless they assist in making judgements and lead to decisions. Therefore, a report should be written very carefully so as to stimulate thought and lead to action. Report writers should concentrate on the collection of relevant data, organising the data and arriving at a conclusion. The contents of the report play a very important role in stimulating action. 12.2.2. Steps in Writing Reports The steps needed to prepare the project report are as follows: Step 1) Verifying the Sources of Data Collection: Verification of the sources of information is a fundamental task which should be carried out prior to the 238 Biostatistics & Research Methodology preparation of research report. The information can be collected from various primary and secondary sources. More important is the research issue, more is the verification needed. Step 2) Formulating a Rough Pattern: During the data collection, researcher notes down the significant and related information that can be included in the research report. As the researcher proceeds in noting down the information, he formulates a pattern to identify relevant and irrelevant information. Step 3) Formulating Final Pattern: On the basis of formulated rough pattern, the collected data is analysed. While analysing the data, the researcher might feel the need to collect more data, while some of the existing data may get rejected because of their unsuitability. By analysing collected data, gradually the final pattern of the research report is formulated which is continuously refined. Step 4) Making an Outline: After formulating the final pattern, an outline of the research report is made, where the researcher decides how to present the report. Various decisions to be made in this stage are related to problem statement, arrangement of various sections, and a logical sequencing is decided. Many times it is not needed, but it helps in finalising the structure of report. Step 5) Writing the First Draft: The next step is writing the first draft of report. It is a rough draft which is prepared by researcher at first. In this stage, the researcher is still in confusion between the notes and the outline of report. Hence, this draft needs refinement till it is finalised. Step 6) Presenting the Rough Draft: In this stage, a rough draft which is prepared in previous stage, is presented in front of the management. It is very important for a researcher to make the management understand what the report is trying to communicate. While preparing rough draft, it should be kept in mind that the language should be clear as well as appealing. The researcher should note down all the suggestions that are given for the improvement. Step 7) Refinement in Rough Draft: In this stage, all the refinements that are suggested by the management are made in the draft. The researcher also needs to carefully analyse the draft and make necessary changes such as adding important details, rearrangement of text, checking of grammar and spelling, etc. This refinement continues in a loop till the top management approves the report. Step 8) Evaluation of Report: After continuous refinement, an almost final report is prepared. In this stage, the top management evaluates the effectiveness of report. They analyse whether the research is completed as per the instructions or not. In this step, the reliability and the validity of the report is checked against set parameters. The report is effective when it is able to communicate the purpose of research clearly and comprehensively without hampering the quality of the report. Step 9) Present and Publish the Final Report: Once the report is finally approved after evaluation, the next thing is presenting it to the intended audience. The presentation should be effective enough to get the attention about the research objectives. This presentation can be enhanced with the help of diagrammatic representation and hand-outs, interaction with audience. Once, the report is successfully presented, it is the time to publish it so that general public can get to know about the research. Organisations can inform the common public with the help of various techniques, such as, bulletin boards, newsletters, etc. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 239 12.2.3. Importance of Report Writing Project report serves many purposes for the organisation and plays a crucial role in management. Preparing a report is important due to following reasons: 1 ) Communicates the Information: Research report can be used as means of communicating facts and information to the top management or executives in the organisation. With the help of reports, ideas, suggestions, and concepts of the organisations are conveyed to their shareholders, customers, general public, top management executives, etc. Communicating information through reports allow the managers to make efficient decisions. 2) Helps in Evaluation: Research report helps the managers to re-evaluate their prevailing problem as well as to plan for future efficiently. Research reports also help various departments to co-ordinate and control their activities. Research reports assist general public in finding probable suggestions regarding their problems. 3) Facilitates Measuring Performance: Research reports can also help in evaluating performance of a particular department/organisation, town, district, state, or country. It provides relevant and complete information about the performance which in turn helps in finding out the ways for betterment. 4) Predicts Future Trends: Research reports contain the facts and figures related to some crucial incidents or occurrence that help in predicting the future occurrences. It can forecast the changing trends of consumer buying, upcoming variation in the market or economy, or need of technical advancement. 5) Helps in Making Desirable Changes: Report helps in making desirable changes in a department, organisation, market, or economy, by understanding its consequences and giving valuable suggestions. It identifies the factors responsible for poor performance of a particular plan, policy, scheme, or organisation and provides ideas or solutions to eliminate those factors so that positive changes could be implemented.","completion":"The project report is a key document that communicates the outcomes of research, demonstrating the methodology, diligence, and findings in a utilizable manner for decision-making purposes. Executives, often the initiators of such projects, mainly focus on the results rather than the research methodology. The art of report writing necessitates hard work, practice, and effort, aiming to present information and recommendations that facilitate judgement and prompt action. Effective report writing involves collecting relevant data, organizing it, and deriving conclusions to stimulate action. The process of writing a project report involves several steps: 1. **Verification of Data Sources**: Ensuring the reliability of information sources is crucial. 2. **Formulating a Rough Pattern**: Noting down significant information during data collection. 3. **Formulating Final Pattern**: Analyzing data to refine the report\'s structure. 4. **Making an Outline**: Deciding on the report\'s presentation and structure. 5. **Writing the First Draft**: Preparing an initial version of the report. 6. **Presenting the Rough Draft**: Sharing the draft with management for feedback. 7. **Refinement**: Incorporating feedback and refining the draft. 8. **Evaluation of Report**: Management evaluates the nearly final report\'s effectiveness. 9. **Present and Publish the Final Report**: Sharing the approved report with the intended audience and the public. The importance of report writing extends across several areas: - **Communication**: It serves as a means to convey information and ideas to stakeholders. - **Evaluation**: Reports allow for the re-assessment of issues and planning. - **Performance Measurement**: They facilitate the evaluation of performance and identification of improvement areas. - **Future Trends Prediction**: Reports can forecast market or economic trends based on past and current data. - **Facilitating Change**: They offer insights and suggestions for implementing positive changes. In essence, a well-crafted project report is crucial for communicating research findings, supporting decision-making, evaluating performance, predicting trends, and facilitating organizational changes."},{"prompt":"PRESENTATION OF DATA The data that we collected are in the form of disorder. Disorderly information is obviously difficult to understand. After data classification, it becomes important that data are to be presented. The presentation of data means exhibition of the data in such a clear and attractive manner that these are easily understood and analysed. There are following methods of presentation: 1) Textual presentation, 2) Tabulation/ Tabular presentation 3) Graphical presentation 12.3.1. Textual Presentation In textual presentation the data art presented in the form of paragraph. This method is not more impressive. It is not a very effective method. It is complex for a user to single out individual figure given in a mixed way in the text and the information has to be read again and again to understand the information. The statements with numerals are described by Textual presentation. It is used to describe the data purposely to get attention to some significant data. Therefore it contians data in expository form. It is suitable for the inadequate data. Though, when many facts are involved, then this method would not be applied only, because of the problems in analysis and integrating list of facts and figures. 240 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Example 2:The 150 person interviewed, and then following complaints were noted: 1) 27 for lack of books in the library, 2) 25 for dirty play area, 3) 20 for lack of workshop apparatus, 4) 17 for a not well maintained campus structures, 5) 17 complained of unsanitary cafeteria 6) 13 complained that the food in the cafeteria is not enough, 7) 10 perceived that the teachers are not friendly, and 8) 5 complained for lack of resting place. 12.3.2. Tabulation (Tabular Presentation of Data) Tabulation is a method of presenting the data in the form of tables so that the results can be interpreted easily. The purpose of tabulation is to present maximum possible information in minimum possible space. In tabulation, the data are represented in a compact form in such a way, that the quality and utility of information is not lost. Tabulation is the final stage of data processing which provides the data for further analysis. It serves the purpose of presenting the data to the client in an aesthetic and easily understandable format. Tabulation is a kind of visual representation that aids the researchers in further analysis and interpretation as well as presentation of data in final stage. Types of Tables These tables are categorised based on the number of characters used to classify the data, and are of two types: 1) Simple Table or One-Way Table: In a one-way table, the classification is made on the basis of only one character. Since, it is the simplest form of table, hence it is also called “simple table”. For example, following table shows number of students in a particular course in a university: Students Total Students MBA 200 PGDBM 100 Total 300 2) Complex Tables: When a table is prepared on the basis of more than one characteristic, it is known as “complex table”. In such tables, more than one classification is represented. In higher level tables both the rows and columns are included. Here, the column represents the category of the item and row represents value of the item. Generally complex tables are of following types: i) Two-Way Table: Two-way tables are made with two characteristics to classify the data. It is also called “double tabulation”. Two-way tables are constructed with the help of one-way table. It is much easier to analyse a two-way table compared to one-way table. For example, following table shows the number of students in a college as per the year in the different courses: Table 12.1: No. of Students in a College (As Per the Year in the Different Course) Name of Courses No. of Students Total 2 Students nd r Year 1 Year MBA 120 80 200 PGDBM 64 36 100 Total 184 116 300 ii) Three-Way Table: When a table is constructed with the help of three interrelated characteristics, it is known as “three-way table” or “treble tabulation”. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 241 By showing three characteristics at a time, a three-way table shows more information regarding a particular phenomenon compared to one-way and twoway tables. For example, following table shows the number of students in a college according to North and South region, the course, and the year of the course: North Region South Region Total Courses Students 2 nd Year 2 nd 1 Year st Year Is\' Year MBA 80 60 40 20 200 PGDBM 40 12 24 24 100 Total 120 72 64 44 300 Multiple-Way Table: A multiple-way table is constructed in the same way as one-way, two-way, and three-way tables are constructed. But the difference here is that there are multiple characteristics which are used to tabulate the data. Usually these types of tables are constructed while collecting census data. These are also known as “manifold tables”. For example, following table categorises four characteristics, which are courses, graduation stream of the students, north and south region, and year: Courses Graduation Stream North Region South Region Total Students Is* Year 2 nd Year l 5 \' Year 2 nd Year MBA Arts 20 15 20 5 60 Science 30 25 10 5 70 Commerce 20 10 5 5 40 BBA 10 10 5 5 30 PGDBM Arts 10 2 6 4 22 Science 10 6 6 8 30 Commerce 10 0 6 8 24 BBA 10 4 6 4 24 Grand Total 120 72 64 44 300 As the number of characteristics increase, the complexity of tabulation also increases. It is not advisable to include more than four characteristics as the table becomes very complex and in turn creates confusion. When more than four characteristics are to be used, then more than one table can be constructed by the researcher, to reduce the complexity. 12.3.3. Graphical Presentation of Data A graph is a visual form of presentation of statistical data. A graph is more attractive than a table of figure. Even a common man can understand the message of data from the graph. Comparisons can be made between two or more phenomena very easily with the help of a graph. In a graphic mode of presentation the points or lines of various kinds are used to represent data. The most commonly used graphs for charting a frequency distribution for the general understanding of the details of the data are as follows: 1) BarCharts 2) Line Charts 3) Frequency Curve 242 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 12.3.3.1. BarCharts Bar charts are used to present the comparison of various categories in the form of horizontal and vertical bars. It is also known as bar diagrams or bar graph. Using the bar chart, one can do the comparison of various items. A bar graph contains the axis, scales, labels and bars. It is best way for the comparison of two or more values. It is used to show any kind of information, like number of employees in the last few years, number of boys and girls in a college, sales of a company, etc. Few bar graphs are clustered in various groups (these clusters have two or more than two bars), and some bar graphs show bars which are divided in various subparts to display the total effect. Example 3:Represent the following data by a bar diagram: Year Production (in tonnes) 2006 45 2007 40 2008 42 2009 55 2010 50 On x-axis: 1.5cm = 1 year On y-axis: 1 cm = 10 tonnes Year wise Distribution of Production inTonnes Solution: 60 50- •s 40- !IH20- 10 - 2006 T 2007 1 T T 2008 2009 2010 Year 12.3.3.2. Line Charts The line chart consists of numerous points interconnected through straight lines. Generally, line charts are used to denote the fluctuation in data over a given time period. It can be said that a line chart/plot/ represents the given information in form of response points connected through straight lines. It is one of the most frequently used types of graph which is used in several areas. It is quite alike a scatter diagram with the only difference of the points (generally those lying on x axis) being joined through straight lines. As the purpose of a line chart is to display the pattern over a given time period, it is drawn in chronological order. Collection of data from experiments is generally viewed through graphs, particularly in experimental sciences. For example, in case the speed of car has to be plotted for given time intervals, it can be viewed through the following data ( table below). Table Speed (ms ‘ Elapsed Time (s) ) 0 0 1 3 2 7 Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 243 3 12 4 20 5 30 6 45.6 Although tabular representation of data is a wonderful way to find the accurate values, yet it fails to display the emerging patterns represented through the values. For this reason, it can lead to lack of clarity on part of mixing of data. However, a tabular representation can be clearer, if it is supported with a line graph. For example, speed/time as given below: 40 | 30 1C/3 20 10 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 Time (s) Figure 12.2: Graph of Speed versus Time 12.3.3.3. Frequency Curve If the middle point of the upper boundaries of the rectangles of a histogram is corrected by a smooth freehand curve, then that diagram is called frequency curve. The curve should begin and end at the base line. Example 4: Draw a frequency curve from the following frequency distribution: Scores Frequency 140 - 144 2 135 - 139 2 130 - 134 2 125 - 129 4 120 - 124 5 115 - 119 9 110 - 114 6 105 - 109 4 100 - 104 3 95 -99 2 90 -94 Solution:The following step is involved for construction of graph: 1) The class groups are given in the descending order. So, if the graph is plotted ‘ as it is’, the advantage of the ‘continuity and order’ may be seriously hampered Moreover, in that case, the frequency curve would be ‘unrepresentative’. Therefore, in this case, the groups are re-written in a proper and systematic form as: Scores Frequency 90 - 94 I 95 -99 2 100 - 104 3 105 - 109 4 244 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 110 - 114 6 115 - 119 9 120 - 124 5 125 - 129 4 130 - 134 2 135 - 139 2 140 - 144 2 2) The scores (as the groups) are represented on the OX-axis. In this particular case, the scale is taken as 1 cm. = 5 group (score). Y 9 / ^ 6 5 4 3 2 1 °0 90-94 140 X -144 Frequency Curve 3) The frequencies are represented, as a variable factor, on the OY-axis. The scale is taken as 1 cm = 1 unit of frequency. 4) The rectangles are first drawn on the basis of the values given and taking into consideration the scales adjusted. 5) Then the upper-end mid-points are plotted. 6) Finally, considering all these, a freehand curve is drawn. The curve so obtained is known as the frequency curve. It is very commonly used in the study of various subjects.","completion":"**Data Presentation Techniques** **Overview:** Data presentation aims to display collected information in a clear, attractive, and analyzable manner. This can be achieved through different methods, including textual presentation, tabulation, and graphical presentation, each serving specific purposes and audiences. **1. Textual Presentation:** Text presentation involves describing data in paragraph form. While this method can highlight specific important data points, it is generally less effective for analysis due to difficulty in isolating individual figures and requires multiple readings to understand fully. **Example Use:** - Highlighting specific findings or numbers within text to draw attention to them. **2. Tabulation (Tabular Presentation):** Tabulation organizes data into tables, providing a compact yet detailed presentation of information without losing quality or utility. It categorizes data based on characteristics, facilitating analysis and interpretation. **Types of Tables:** - **Simple Table (One-Way Table):** Based on one characteristic. - **Complex Tables:** - **Two-Way Table:** Incorporates two characteristics. - **Three-Way Table:** Utilizes three interrelated characteristics. - **Multiple-Way Table:** Uses more than three characteristics for highly detailed data organization. Note, however, that tables with more than four characteristics can become overly complex. **3. Graphical Presentation:** Graphical presentation uses visual elements like bars, lines, or curves to represent data, making it accessible and understandable even to those not specialized in data analysis. It\'s particularly effective for showing comparisons, trends, and patterns. **Types of Graphs:** - **Bar Charts:** Compare different categories using horizontal or vertical bars. - **Line Charts:** Demonstrate fluctuations in data over time, connecting data points with straight lines. - **Frequency Curve:** A smooth curve connecting the mid-points of histogram bars, useful for showing distribution tendencies. **Importance:** Effective data presentation is crucial for making informed decisions and conveying findings in an impactful manner. Each method has its strengths and should be chosen based on the dataset\'s nature and the audience\'s needs for clarity, detail, and accessibility. **Conclusion:** Choosing the right data presentation technique, whether textual, tabular, or graphical, depends on the specific goals of data analysis and the intended audience. The key is to present data in a manner that is both comprehensible and engaging, facilitating insights and decisions from the presented information."},{"prompt":"PROTOCOL 12.4. 1. Introduction A protocol is the summarising statement related to the problem, the objective of study and methodology to be followed. The protocol supports the study of all steps under execution. The main focus to study the protocol is to state the problem, objective and suggestions. According to a protocol or an action plan, clinical research is conducted.

Introduction The word ‘cohort’ is obtained from the Latin word cohors’ which means an enclosure, company or crowd. In Roman times, a cohort was a body of 300-600 infantry. In epidemiological, the cohort is defined as a group of people having something common, an exposure or involvement in population group. The cohort study is a study design in which one or more samples (called cohorts) evaluate the future and subsequent condition in relation to a disease or outcome that determine the initial participants’ risks (risk Factors) are associated with it. As the study is in progress, results from participants in every cohort are measured and relationships between their features are determined. In cohort study, a group of respondents who experience the same events during a same time interval are observed. Rather than measuring the same people, it seeks to observe different categories of people. The group of respondents should belong to the same group who experience the same. This research is “explicitly macro-analytical” in nature, which implies that the researcher considers the whole category for observing the features. An example of cohort study is measuring the changes in voter opinions during polls. One or more groups of subjects are included in a cohort study which is defined by their exposure condition and being followed through time to identify a result of disease. Their objectives are to determine whether initial exposure condition effects risk of consequential disease. 12.5.2. Concept of a Cohort Study Tracking the study population over a period of time is included in the cohort study and a feature reflected in three synonyms for this design: 1) Follow-Up, 2) Longitudinal and 3) Prospective.

Health result or health change data are obtained in the same person at the same time, and not just once as in cross-sectional studies. This is the hallmark of this design. This is related to one or more characteristics that study the risk factors or portions of the natural history of diseases in individuals. For example, future outcomes like exercise, coronary heart disease (figure 12.3 and 12.4). Two groups are identified in the base population (all ellipses) as shown in figure 12.3. Those who exercise (elliptically marked E) and those who do not (marked as NE). These groups are followed periodically to find out the number of new cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) from which time of incidence rate of the disease can be calculated. Data are collected for the creation of sampling frames and the assignment of exposure conditions and hence this is applied to retrospective cohorts too. In relation to the natural history of the disease, cohort studies are future oriented as shown in Figure 12.4. Explores natural history including disease outcomes Past Now / Future Exposure is known, outcome will be explored Figure 12.4: Natural History of Disease and Cohort Studies Within the cohort, comparisons groups are identities (e.g., people who smoke or do not smoke) but sometimes individual cohorts are initially established at the outset. The cohort study is usually searching for a specific hypothesis, which determines the nature of the comparison group. Cohort studies starts by collecting basic baseline data, usually from a cross-sectional study, or by extraction of baseline data from the census. Such cohorts are rare. For example, a regular information system such as a birth register. 12.5.3. Framework or Design of a Cohort Study Follow-up or incident studies are the other names of cohort studies. This study starts with the group of people who are free from disease and are divided into sub-groups according to possible cause of illness or results (figure 12.5). Variations of interest are defined and measured by following the whole cohort to determine how the later development of new cases of the disease varies between groups before and after exposure. Cohort studies are longitudinal, such as case-control studies as the data of exposure and disease vary at point to point in time. 250 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Time Direction of inquiry r - ] Disease i I - * [ Exposed | » --J -- ] No Disease ] People without the disease Population - 1 NE r _ ! Disease - Not Exposed p ~ [ -- I No Disease I Figure 12.5: Design of a Cohort Study 12.5.4. Types of Cohort Study According to point in time when exposure information was collected, there were following main types of cohort studies are defined: 1) Prospective Cohort Study (Concurrent or Longitudinal Cohort Study), 2) Retrospective Cohort Study (Historical Cohort or Non-Concurrent Prospective Cohort), and 3) Combination of Prospective and Retrospective Cohort Study 12.5.4.1. Prospective Cohort Study (Concurrent or Longitudinal Cohort Study) Once the study population defined, data on exposure is collect in prospective cohort studies. For example, it is possible to use the most updated methods of exposure so that bias in exposure classification can be minimized. The major drawback of this cohort study is that the time from exposure to onset of disease may be very long. The major benefits of this study are that the exposure can be determined and how it is measured can also be find out. Procedures allowing future detection and tracking of changes to be applied. If and when change in exposure status is measured. The nature of outcome measures can be found out. 12.5.4.2. Retrospective Cohort Study (Historical Cohort or Nonconcurrent Prospective Cohort) Retrospective Cohort Study is useful for situations with long induction periods, is to focus on exposure measurements made several years before the study was established and that may be available from employment, medical, or other records. Using data from existing records, the time to wait for the risk of any effect on disease can be significantly reduced or eliminated. Such type of cohort study is known as retrospective / historical cohort study. A retrospective study will: 1 ) Rely on when sufficient record are available on the exposure status and is able to find out the present disease status; 2) Identifying cohort subjects on national disease registers and may need to consider whether information about changes in exposure status is available; and what data is available on other risk factors for the disease related to the risk status, i.e. confounding factors. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 251 Historical cohort studies have several disadvantages also. In past records the available exposure data are less precise and have more detailed than if they were collected prospectively. For example in historical occupational cohorts previous exposure measurements made in the working environment are rarely available and hence variables such as work project or professional society are generally used to categorize individual exposure. In previous exposure measurement this process reduces inaccuracies, but the stability of the biological marker during long periods of storage is often unknown and the number of such biological sample banks is limited.

Combination of Prospective and Retrospective Cohort Study In this, the representation of a combination of prospective and retrospective cohorts have been designed and utilized. According to Hennekens and Buring this mixture of prospective and retrospective cohort as occurring in ambidirection. This means that the data are collected both prior to and following an exposure of interest. The ability to explore both the possible short-and long-term effects of an exposure is the main benefit of hybrid cohort study design. These are the combinations of both retrospective and prospective elements. The date of the outcome is assessed by identifying the cohort from previous records and then followed up in the future for further assessment of the result, for example, Court -Brown and Doll in the study of radiation effects. In year 1955, they assembled a cohort consisting of 13,352 patients who received large doses of radiation therapy between 1934 and 1954 for ankylosing spondylitis. The result was death from leukemia or aplastic anemia. 12.5.5. Steps in Planning a Cohort Study The steps to conduct cohort study are given below: 1) Selection of Subjects (Source of the Study Population ): The choice of subjects is determined by the repetition of exposure and the requirement to obtain complete and important information about both exposure and result on entire the study subjects. 252 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Sufficient numbers of subjects may be enrolled from various sources for relatively common exposures such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, bottle feeding, etc. In the case of rare exposures, specific groups may need to be considered, for example, exposure to radiation or industrial toxins, etc. These exposure cohorts allow assessment of rare conditions. 2) Selection of Comparison Groups: When the source of the exposed subjects is determined, the other step is to choose a suitable comparison group of unexposed individuals. This step is most important in the design of a cohort study. The unexposed group must be equal to the exposure group with respect to the distribution of all factors, except for the exposures under analysis. The following are the two main types of comparison group that may be used in a cohort study: i) Internal Comparison Group: Using an internal comparison group, members of the general population can be classified into other exposure categories because general population cohorts are heterogeneous in relation to multiple exposures. This means that the experience of members of the cohort who are either unexposed or exposed to low levels can be used as a comparison group. ii) External Comparison Group: In the case of exposure to the suspected component when the cohort is essentially equal, a similar but unexposed cohort, or some other standard of comparison, is required to evaluate the exposed group.For example, it is not possible to identify a subgroup of cohorts in some occupational groups that may be considered to be \'unexposed\' for comparison. In this example, an external comparison group must be used. 3) Measurement of Exposure: This is an important aspect in the design of a cohort study. The pattern of exposures (intermittently vs. stable), and changes over time and the dates on which the exposure began and stopped, are the information that must be first obtained in the exposure. The amount of detail may not be sufficient for the study nor are the details of potential confounding factors likely to be adequately recorded. But the use or pre-existing record saves time and cost. In most situations, details obtained from pre-existing records should be supplemented by interviews, questionnaires, physical exams and laboratory tests. The information gathered at the time of enrolment about changes in employment, work patterns, life-style, diet and so on, needs to be updated at each follow-up. 4) Measurement of Confounding Variables: Participants are not randomly allocated to different exposure categories because cohort studies are observational studies. This can cause differences among groups in terms of risks other than being studied. This only matters if these other risks under study are also risk factors for the particular disease (or other outcome), that is, if these exposures are varying. Thus, if an occupational risk is studied in relation to lung cancer, it is essential to ensure that the ‘exposed’ and ‘unpublished’ groups have a similar smoking history. 5) Measurement of Outcome(s): To obtain complete and unbiased information about the result in every subject is the main goal of all cohort studies. The common methods of recording outcomes are like hospital records, physical examination, laboratory tests, questionnaires and interviews. The main issue is that the procedures used for recording results should be applied homogenously to all groups. One main advantage of cohort studies is that one can examine the effect of a specific exposure on multiple results. Several cohort studies use existing routine monitoring systems to detect results of interest. Such systems include cancer registries, death certificates, and others. They Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 253 allow monitoring of the subjects of the study and do so at a much lower cost than tracing their results if it is necessary to contact the subjects. However, it is possible to examine the results of only those types that have been routinely recorded by these systems and the way they are coded. This is essential in studies lasting several decades, as major changes can be introduced during the study to detect diseases can be determined by these surveillance systems. 6) Follow-up: Methods should be determined at the beginning of the study to ensure adequate adherence to the subjects studied. In general, this includes periodic contacts with individuals such as home visits, telephone calls or mailed questionnaires. Costudy of conditions with a long induction period is necessary to follow a large number of subjects over several years. This is clearly a very large and expensive enterprise. To reduce these difficulties, many groups are defined as membership of a particular group (occupational body, occupational pension scheme, association, health insurance scheme, college alumni), with more ease of study population Can be followed. For example, if the death is the result, then all cohort members can know the important status on that date. All subjects of interest whose vital status is known at that date must contribute the person-time at risk by that date. Those whose vital status is not known at that date should be considered as lost in follow-up’ and the last date for which their vital status was known was taken as the person at risk. 7) Analysis (Attributable Risk, Relative Risk, and Population Attributable Risk): Measuring the incidence of disease in exposed and unexposed exposure and comparing them is the first step of analysis of a cohort study. Researchers typically seek to compare frequency of disease in two or more diseases, which differ for some potential risk factor. Several measures of the relationship between risk and disease are used to compare risks. These measures of effect are as follows: i) Attributable Risk (AR): AR is the risk difference, which measure the answer to the question “What is the additional risk following exposure that experienced by people who are not exposed?” AR = Incidence in Exposed -Incidence in Not Exposed ii) Relative Risk (RR): RR is the risk ratios which focus on the question “How many times more likely are exposed persons to get the disease relative to nonexposed persons?” This is not giving the information about the magnitude of absolute risk. In the case of uncommon diseases, the value of absolute risk may be very small for a large RR. Incidence in Exposed RR = Incidence in Non - Exposed AR is a more meaningful measure of risk in most clinical situations because it represents a real additional likelihood of the disease in people being exposed. iii) Population Attributable Risk: This is measure that focus on the question “How much does a risk factor contribute to the overall rates of disease in a population?” Such information is useful in deciding which risk factors are necessary and which are feasible for public health. 254 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Population Attributable Risk = AR x Prevalence of Risk Factor in the Population under Study Population attribute risk is a measure of excess frequency of disease in a group related with the frequency of a risk factor. Population Attributable fraction is a fraction of the incidence of disease that is related with a particular risk factor. Population Attributable Fraction = PopulationAttributable Risk TotalIncidenceof Diseasein the Population In case, all cohort members were following the same period of time, then risk can be determined as the measure of incidence of disease in each group (table 12.3 a). For example, in case of the period of five years, the five year risk can be determined separately for the exposed and unexposed groups. The calculation of Risk ratio and risk difference can be done as measures the relative and absolute effect, respectively. In case, the study subjects have unequal periods then this must be taken into consideration in the analysis. The follow-up period may vary in case, subjects were recruited into the study population for long time or in case, some were lost to follow-up during the study (e.g., exiting from the area). The method to handle variable follow-up periods is to determine the rates that use person-years at risk as a denominator (Table 12.3 b). With this method, each subject contributes to the population at risk only as several years of observation as anyone actually observed. Hence in case, the subject leaves after 1 year, one contributes 1 person-year; in case after 8, 8 person-years.

Advantages of a Cohort Study Following are the various advantages of cohort study: 1) With the help of cohort study, subject can be matched and which limit the effect of the confounding variable. 2) With cohort study, it is possible to standardize the outcome. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 255 3) This study is simple and affordable than a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). 4) In case the study groups have been selected in suitable manner they allow direct calculation of incidence rather than an odds ratio. For measuring incidence, cohort designs can be considered as a powerful strategy. 5) It is the best available observational studies as replaces the true experimental studies. 12.5.7. Disadvantages of a Cohort Study Following are the various disadvantages of cohort study: 1) In case the result is unique; a huge number of people must enter the study and be followed for a long time before results come. This has implications for costs with regard to staff, transportation and time. Cohort studies are more efficient for general results, and not for rare diseases. 2) Initially the conditions may be present but, asymptomatic and clinically undiagnosed. 3) There is no randomness in the cohort study which means that imbalances in patient characteristics may exist. 4) In this study, blinding / masking are difficult. 5) In a cohort study, result of interest may take long time to occur","completion":"# Summary of Cohort Studies Introduction to Cohort Studies - Origin: The term \\"cohort\\" stems from Latin \\"cohors,\\" meaning a group with common characteristics. - Definition: A cohort study follows groups (cohorts) over time to investigate how certain factors affect disease outcomes. - Purpose: Identifies and analyzes relationships between risk factors and disease by observing varied groups. Concept and Design - Nature: Prospective, follows a population over time to study the development of outcomes relative to exposures or characteristics. - Key Features: Follow-up, longitudinal, and prospective studies tracking population to reveal relationships between exposures and outcomes. Types of Cohort Studies 1. **Prospective Cohort Study**: Monitors a group following the identification of exposure up to the outcome manifesting, characterized by direct current data collection. 2. **Retrospective Cohort Study**: Utilizes historical data to examine exposures and subsequent outcomes, often relying on existing records. 3. **Combination of Prospective and Retrospective**: Incorporates elements from both, allowing study of short-and long-term exposure effects. Planning and Execution 1. **Selection of Subjects**: Chosen based on exposure prevalence and capability to offer comprehensive data. 2. **Comparison Groups**: Key to design; can be internal (within cohort) or external (outside cohort) for balanced assessment. 3. **Measurement of Exposure**: Essential for validating study hypothesis; involves detailing exposure pattern and potential changes. 4. **Confounding Variables**: Important to measure for establishing the specific effect of the exposure. 5. **Outcome Measurement**: Ensures unbiased and complete information collection across groups, often utilizing existing data systems for efficiency. 6. **Follow-Up**: Critical for maintaining participant engagement and ensuring comprehensive data collection over the study period. 7. **Analysis**: Involves calculating disease incidence in exposed vs. non-exposed groups and employing metrics like Attributable Risk (AR) and Relative Risk (RR).

Their design varies from prospective to retrospective approaches, each with unique strengths and limitations, offering valuable insights into disease etiology and prevention strategies."},{"prompt":"OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES 12.6. 1. Introduction The method involving the systematic recording and assessment of behavioural forms of a particular individual (or group of individual), object or event so as to collect desired information about a research problem without any personal communication is called ‘Observation’ . Here, the observer observes the object from a suitable distance or through audio-video recordings. The information is recorded for future use. The respondents may be observed in their natural environment or a contrived environment is designed for the purpose. The approach for observation may be direct or indirect, structured or unstructured. The observation method is very popular for behavioural science researches. Every individual observes certain things around him/her but it cannot be termed as scientific observation. Scientific observation is the observation where a particular research problem is the focus of the observation. A systematic planning and controlling is required for recording such observations. Different validity and reliability check measures are used here so as to collect accurate information. 12.6.2. Types of Observation: Observational Methods Types of observations are as follows: 1) Participation and Non-participation Observation: This classification is based on the type of role played by the observer/researcher as a particular or non-participant in the process of observation. At one end is the complete participant, moving to the participant-as-observer, then to the observer-as-participant, and finally to the complete observer (non-participant observer). The move is from complete participation or attachment to complete non-participation or detachment. Participation and non-participation observation can take following forms: i) Participant-As-Observer: As a participant-as-observer, the researcher would take a more participatory role in the organisation’s activities. This role might be an established one, e.g., as an employee within the organisation. 256 Biostatistics & Research Methodology ii) Observer-As-Participant: Further along the dimension, at the point when an observer starts to act as d participant, there would be more interaction with those being researched. It is likely that the observations would be carried out in a naturalistic selling and the participants would be aware that they were being observed. iii) Full -Observer: As a full-observer, the researcher will have minimal contact, or no contact at all, with the research participants. This would apply, e.g., to psychology laboratory research where there would be limited interaction between the experimenter and participants. 2) Structured and Unstructured Observation: Structured observation is used when the research problem has been formulated precisely and the researcher is told to observe the area of study. The researchers are asked to record their observations. In structured observation the problem has been clearly defined, hence the behaviour to be observed and the method by which it will be measured is specified in detail. On the other hand unstructured observation implies that the researchers are free to observe whatever they feel relevant and judicious. In unstructured analysis is used in situations where the problem has not been clearly defined hence it cannot be pre specified whatever we have to specified. It involves researchers watching participants and recording behaviours they feel are relevant to the study being conducted. 3) Disguised and Undisguised Observation: With the disguised observation approach, participants do not know they are being observed. This can be done through video cameras, one-way mirrors, electronic measures such as website cookies, or even human observers who look and act like another customer or perhaps one of the employees. Here, the subject or informants do not know that they are being observed. In disguised observation the respondents are unaware that they are being observed. Their behaviour is observed using one way mirrors, hidden cameras or other devices. In Undisguised observation the respondents are aware that they being observed. This approach may help encourage the customer to act normally and not be affected by the researcher’ s presence, though some individuals may alter their behaviour or chokes specifically because they know they are being watched. 4) Observation under Natural Setting and Laboratory Setting: Observations in field studies are in their natural setting and are studied in extremely realistic conditions. Sometimes, an experimental manipulation may be introduced in a field study. The primary advantage of using a natural setting is that researchers do not interfere with customers and thus observations are natural reactions. Even if consumers know they are being watched, they will still tend to act more naturally than they may in a laboratory or contrived setting. Observation in a laboratory setting, on the other hand, enables the observer to control extraneous variables, which influence the behaviour of people. Observational studies in laboratory settings have certain advantages over field studies. They enable the collection of data promptly and economically and in addition, permit the use of more objective measurements. 5) Direct and Indirect Observation: In direct observation, the behaviour of a person is observed. Most observation research is direct observation, which involves researchers watching participants as the behaviour is taking place. This approach allows researchers to observe not only the behaviour, but also any words spoken and even body language. For example, for observing purchase behaviour of shopper for a tea packet, a researcher can stand in a big grocery store just aside the shelf that contains tea packets. He can systematically record the behaviour of flue shoppers Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 257 such as their first pick (choice) from the shelf, their preference for the hard pack, jar pack, or poly pack; their inclination for a particular brand; impact of price (as the shopper picks a pack and places it back on the shelf after seeing the price), and so on. On the other hand indirect observation implies that same record of past behaviour is observed, the behaviour is not observed, and rather its effects are observed. Here the observer engaged in indirect observation generally looks for physical traces of behaviour or occurrence of an event. In indirect observation, the researcher observes outcome of behaviour rather than observing the behaviour. For example, a researcher can count the number of cups in which tea is consumed in a product demonstration to note the consumer preference for a particular brand or taste. 6) Human-Mechanical Observation: Here observations are done by manually or by machines. Most of the studies in marketing research are based on human observation where in trained observers are required to observe and faithfully record their observations. Humans have the advantage of being able to observe another person’s entire repertoire of behaviours from actions to body language to words spoken. Significant data could be missed if a mechanical device were used. However, that ability to fully observe could also result in failure to accurately notice various behaviours if the actions occur too rapidly or the researcher is distracted by another person, the environment, or even the subject\' s actions that are not part of the study. In some cases, mechanical devices such as eye cameras and audiometers are used for observation. One of the major advantages of electrical/ mechanical devices is that their recordings are free from subjective bias. As against this advantage, such observations may be less valid than human observations. This is because the observer’s power of integration can lead to a more valid evaluation of the observation. 12.6.3. Process of Conducting Observation The researchers need to employ observation in a scientific way since it is used as a research technique or a data collection tool which enables them to find out the answers for the various research questions. In order to accomplish this objective, the following steps are required to be adopted by the researchers or observers: Step 1: Planning for Observation: The first and foremost step in the process of observation is planning. One should not conduct any observation activity in a hasty or unplanned manner. This activity should be planned with care and complete analysis should be done before implementing it. In order to conduct the various activities as planned, the questions such as who, how, when, what, why and where related to the observation activities must be replied by the researcher. By giving concern to the above mentioned issues, a researcher can formulate an appropriate plan which will help him in executing the observational activities. Following factors must be taken care by the researchers (as advised by Sukhia et.al.) while using observational method as a tool of research: 1) All the particular behaviours or activities which are to be observed should be defined clearly. 2) Group or cluster of subjects to be observed should be defined. 3) Scope of the method should be defined, i.e., either individual or group. 4) Number of observation sessions, duration of observation sessions and the time lag between two different observation sessions should be determined. 5) Also the position of the observer, the instrument used and the recording format should be determined. 258 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 6) Certain special conditions which may be necessary for the subjects should be defined. 7) In order to record the observations, suitable tools should be designed. 8) Required training should be acquired to be an expert observer. Step 2: Execution and Recording of Observation: Whatever planning was done in the first step is now required to be executed in appropriate manner. Efficient execution and recording activities undertaken by the observer becomes the key for successful observation. In order to accomplish this objective, below mentioned points must be taken care of: 1) Based on the setting of observation, i.e., natural or artificial environment, the factors and situations concerning the subject should be determined. No specific setting is required for observation in natural environment, whereas, various factors and situations need to be designed for observing the subject in the artificial environment. Some of the examples of such activities can be creating rapport with the subjects, favourable encouraging environment, seating arrangement for the subjects, and so on. 2) In order to record the on-going activities of the observation, it is important for the observer to be careful, alert and attentive. The various things which are to be observed must be recorded properly by arranging suitable tools. If during the observation, one is not in condition to record the observed points, then these points should be remembered and noted down as soon as possible after the observation. 3) Higher level of objectivity has to be maintained by the observer while observing, classifying and recording the things and events. This can be achieved by minimising the impacts put on by observer’s personal values, biases, attitudes, likes and dislikes on the outcomes of the observation. 4) The following methods are mainly used by observers for recording the observations: i) Utilising rating scales, observation schedule, checklists, blank forms and score cards. ii) Use of narratives, i.e., using own words for elaborating the things which are being observed. iii) Using various technological and mechanical devices such as mechanical counters, audio and videotape recorders, video tapes, stopwatches, one way mirror rooms ( so that observers can see the subjects without being noticed by them), concealed microphones and video tapes, motion pictures or films, computer technology, binoculars, audiometer, camera, etc. Step 3: Interpretation of the Observed Results or Findings: In this step, the interpretation of recorded and categorised observation data is done so that the various research questions can be answered. In deriving suitable and valid conclusions and inferences from the observations which are recorded, special cautions must be taken by the observers. The obtained conclusions and inferences should have objectivity, validity and reliability on part of the observer/researcher. In order to generate the appropriate and genuine interpretations of the observation, the researcher should not have any kind of confusion, prejudices,subjectivity biases or rigidity. 12.6.4. Significance of Observ ation Following points highlight the significance of observation method: 1) Suitable for Non-verbal Behaviour: Generally,survey method is used to collect the verbal information from different respondents, but in case of collecting information through non-verbal behaviour, observation method is useful. In-depth information about the respondent can be collected through observing his/her behaviour. 2) In-depth Information: Due to prolonged closeness between the observer and the respondent, a healthy and informal relationship is developed between them. The closeness increases with the time. It leads to exploration of in-depth and private information from the respondent. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 259 3) Free from Biasness: As the behaviour of the respondent is observed in natural setting, it is free from biasness. Genuine and reliable information is generated through observation method. 4) Useful in Longitudinal Analysis: Observation method is very useful for longitudinal analysis as the observation may be continued to prolonged period. 12.6.5. Limitations of Observation Different limitations of observation method are as follows: 1) Lack of Control: In observation method, the most critical point is the nature of control. It is not possible for the observer to control the natural variables affecting the behaviour of the respondent. 2) Difficulties of Quantification: Another limitation of observation method is the absence of quantification of data. The behaviours of respondents cannot be quantified, only the nature of their behaviour may be described for research purpose. 3) Small Sample: Observation method is based on small samples, thus, these may not be the representative of the total population. 4) Costly: In order to observe large samples, more observers need to be assigned. As the observation method is time-taking, more remuneration is required to pay for observers. 5) Difficult to Obtain Permission: In cases, where the observer is required to observe a particular institution or organisation, permission is to be taken from the administrator. It is not easy to get permission in such cases.","completion":"**Summary of Observational Studies** # Introduction Observational studies involve the systematic recording of behaviors, events, or conditions without direct interaction with the subjects.

This method involves modifying your `data_generator` function to accept a parameter that defines whether to generate training data or validation data and splitting your dataset accordingly. Here\'s how you can update your code to incorporate a validation set: 1. **Modify `data_generator` to accept and handle splitting:** Update the `data_generator` function to include a new parameter, `mode`, which determines whether the generator yields training or validation data. Then, use a portion of each chunk for validation based on a specified split ratio. 2. **Split data in generator:** Within the modified `data_generator`, use a simple method to split the chunk into training and validation data. 3. **Adjust model fitting to include validation data:** Update the `model.fit()` call to include validation data by creating a separate generator instance for validation.

DNA is a long molecule composed of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix. These strands are made up of simpler molecules called nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a sugar group (deoxyribose in the case of DNA), and one of four types of nitrogen bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). The order, or sequence, of these bases forms the instructions in the genome of an organism. The structure of DNA allows it to store information in a manner somewhat akin to a code, with the sequence of bases acting as letters in a complex alphabet. This genetic information is passed from parents to offspring and is used by cells to produce the specific proteins needed by the organism. These proteins in turn determine a wide array of characteristics in the organism, from physical traits like eye color to predispositions to certain health conditions. DNA replication is a critical process that occurs during cell division, ensuring that each new cell receives a complete set of instructions. Errors in DNA replication can lead to mutations, which are changes in the sequence of bases. Some mutations can be harmful, some beneficial, and many neutral, playing a significant role in evolution by natural selection. DNA plays a central role in genetics and is the principal constituent of chromosomes within the cell nucleus. The study of DNA and genetic information is critical in numerous fields, including medicine, forensic science, biology, and genetics, providing insights into everything from genetic diseases to ancestry and evolutionary biology."},{"prompt":"Create a vividly detailed and comedic story movie scene set in eastern europe about a Slavic twink waist-deep in a bog in the buff (compliment his physique, face and butt. the twink’s hair is so long, his pecs is puffy, and hips wide, most don’t know if its a male or female).

The air is alive with the murmur of distant wildlife, the buzz of insects, and the occasional bird call that slices through the tranquility. Humidity hangs thick, wrapping around everything like a warm towel. Enter our protagonist, an ethereal Slavic twink named Sasha, whose appearance straddles the line between masculinity and femininity with an exquisite grace. His physique, statuesque yet lithe, glistens with a sheen of water and sporadic patches of mud that accentuate the contours of his body like an artist highlighting features with a charcoal stick. Chestnut hair cascades down his shoulders, flowing with a life of its own, partially submerged, melding with the marsh\'s murky waters. Pectorals puff proudly beneath, leading to a surprisingly slender waist, giving him an hourglass figure that would have made Venuses of antiquity weep in envy. His hips, wide and inviting, complement the soft curvature of his high, pert buttocks, sculpted as if by the hands of a baroque artist. With androgyny painted in every curve and muscle, the beholder is left questioning, yet marveling, at such a vision of beauty. Amidst this thick foliage and bubbling mud, Sasha finds himself waist-deep, his visage one of serene composure as he tenderly lifts his arms, revealing underarms that need attending. Nonchalantly, he begins the delicate task of bathing, unperturbed by his audacious nakedness. \\"I swear,\\" Sasha mumbles to himself, the timbre of his voice undeniably masculine, yet light, almost musical, dispelling any lingering doubts of his gender, \\"this bog bath is better than any spa back in the city.\\" A shimmer of mischief then lights his eyes, an idea brewing within. \\"Ah, to dine as our ancestors did,\\" he declares with a giddy smugness, positioning himself as though he were about to perform the most natural and necessary of actions. With no hesitation, Sasha releases what can only be described as a cataclysmic fart into the tranquil waters of the bog. The sound ripples through the air, a comedic symphony of nature and man in unison. Bubbles furiously surface as if the bog itself is reacting in both shock and awe. Seconds tick by in silent anticipation before several fish float to the water\'s surface, victims of a stench so lethal it could only be weaponized in the most dire of circumstances. \\"Oh, splendid!\\" Sasha exclaims gleefully, retrieving a rather sizable fish from the assortment of unfortunate aquatic life. \\"Dinner is served, courtesy of my mighty winds.\\" As he wades towards the bank, fish in hand, he muses aloud, \\"Who needs fishing poles when you possess the unparalleled power of flatulence?\\" The whimsy of this scene, set against the backdrop of the untamed Eastern European wilderness, glistens with a comedic brilliance. Sasha, our beguiling protagonist, stands as a testament to the unexpected, where virility and delicacy interlace, and where the profundity of one\'s cuisine acquisition methods knows no bounds. \\"Ah, back to nature indeed,\\" he sighs contentedly, disappearing into the embrace of the dense foliage, leaving behind only ripples and laughter. **THE END.**"},{"prompt":"Create a vividly detailed and comedic story set in eastern europe about a Slavic twink waist-deep in a bog in the buff (compliment his physique, face and butt. the twink’s hair is so long, his pecs is puffy, and hips wide, most don’t know if its a male or female).

This person was Boris, a twink so exquisitely sculpted by the hands of mischievous spirits that to gaze upon him was to question the tales of old. Boris, with his hair cascading in long tendrils down to his waist, shimmering under the sun like threads of gold spun by the dawn itself, found himself waist-deep in the cool embrace of a bog. His bare skin, kissed by the sun and as flawless as the surface of a tranquil lake, complemented the wild, untamed beauty of his surroundings. His delicate features, framed by his lavish locks, seemed almost ethereal, and his posterior, perched above the water like two perfect peaches, would make even the sirens green with envy. As Boris submerged himself further, the water lapped against his puffy pecs, which were as ripe as the juiciest fruits of summer, and his wide hips seemed to sway with the rhythm of the ancient earth itself. In this moment of solitude, he began the most peculiar of rituals. \\"Ah, the spa of Mother Nature,\\" Boris mused aloud in a voice as clear as the babbling brooks. \\"Time for a little cleanse, I suppose.\\" He proceeded to wash his pits with a finesse that could only be mastered by someone as devoted to personal hygiene as he was to the art of being fabulously unconventional. But Boris harbored a secret, a talent so unique that even the whispers of the wind dared not carry its tale far. Feeling a rumble in his belly, Boris smirked, his eyes twinkling with mischief. \\"Ah, why forage like a mere mortal when I have been blessed with a gift?\\" he whispered to himself. With the confidence of a maestro about to conduct a symphony, Boris positioned himself, took a deep breath, and, with a cheeky glance towards the heavens as if to say, \\"Forgive me for what I\'m about to unleash,\\" he let out a fart so potent, so deadly, that it seemed to echo through the bog like a clap of thunder. The water bubbled as if a potion was brewing, and within moments, several fish floated to the surface, rendered lifeless by the noxious fumes of Boris’s unnatural ability. \\"Ah, lunch is served!\\" Boris exclaimed with glee, plucking a particularly plump fish from the water. \\"Who needs fishing poles when you have cheeks of steel?\\" As he made his way out of the bog, fish in hand and not a shred of regret in his being, Boris couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. \\"To think,\\" he chuckled, \\"all these years people have debated the secrets to my allure, and here I am, using my deadly farts to fish. If only they knew!\\" As Boris disappeared into the embrace of the forest, his laughter mingled with the sounds of nature, leaving behind only ripples of bewilderment and the faintest scent of mystery. In the marshes of Eastern Europe, where legends are as plentiful as the reeds, the tale of Boris, the strikingly beautiful twink who could bring dinner to the table with nothing but the power of his posterior, became yet another story whispered among the trees, tickling the curiosity of all who dared to listen. And so, in the land where the bogs whisper secrets and the wind carries tales, Boris became a legend, his story a peculiar blend of beauty, oddity, and an unapologetic embrace of one\'s true self."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Understanding this diversity helps us categorize planets, enriching our comprehension of planetary formation, evolution, and the potential for life beyond Earth. This guide delves into the planetology classification, detailing types of planets, seas on certain planetary types, special traits, and aerosol classification systems for gaseous planets. # Types of Planets 1. **Rocky (Selenian):** Characterized by a solid surface predominantly composed of rock and metal. 2. **Terramare (Earth-like):** Featuring a balanced mix of land and sea, resembling Earth. 3. **Ocean:** Dominated by extensive bodies of liquid, covering the majority of the surface. 4. **Desert (Martian):** Dry, arid landscapes with minimal to no precipitation. 5. **Gaseous (Jovian):** Composed primarily of gases, with no solid surface. 6. **Ice:** Environments where water or other substances are frozen on the surface. # Types of Seas in Terramare and Ice Planets 1. **Wateric:** Composed of H2O. 2. **Ammonic:** Composed of NH3. 3. **Methanic:** Composed of CH4. 4. **Nitric:** Composed of N2. 5. **Ionic:** Composed of S. 6. **Cyanogenic:** Composed of (CN)2. 7. **Neonic:** Composed of Ne. 8. **Helic:** Composed of He. 9. **Oxygenic:** Composed of O2. 10. **Hydric:** Composed of H2. # Special Traits of Planets - **Cytherean:** Features intense greenhouse effect and obscured by fog. - **Europan:** Not detailed, but likely references to characteristics similar to Jupiter\'s moon Europa. - **Nyctonian:** Terrestrial planets without a star, sustaining temperate climates presumably through internal heating or other phenomena. - **Chthonian:** Originally gaseous planets whose atmospheres have been stripped away, leaving behind a dense core. # Aerosol Classification System (for Gaseous Planets) This system helps in identifying the nature of clouds and hazes present in the atmospheres of gaseous planets. - **H - Frigidian:** Clear skies with minimal chemical activity. - **N - Rhodonian:** Dominated by simple molecules like nitrogen and oxygen. - **M - Methanian:** Characterized by methane and its derivatives. - **P - Springian:** Contains organic and sulfur hazes. - **T - Tholinian:** Comprised of complex organic molecules. [...] This classification framework progresses to include each element\'s distinctive coloration, ranging from clear, pristine whites to deep and complex shades, indicating the chemical composition and physical conditions of the atmospheric phenomena. # Climatonomic Classification System of Gaseous Planets This system categorizes the gaseous planets based on the behavior of their clouds and hazes in relation to temperature. - **Cryocumulian:** Features clouds that are perpetually below the temperature threshold, eliminating the possibility of rain. - **Nepholian:** Encompasses raining cloud systems. - **Pyrostratian:** Comprises clouds or hazes that exist above the temperature range, preventing rainfall.

1. 示例：使用更大的 Vision Transformer 模型 考虑到你目前使用的是 `vit_base_patch16_224_ce`，我们可以选择 `vit_large_patch16_224_ce` 作为一个更大、更强的版本。但是，如果你已经有了 `vit_large_patch16_224_ce` 的实现，而需要进一步提升，那么我们可以考虑使用一个大型模型，比如 `vit_huge_patch14_224` 或者使用 `Swin Transformer`。 下面是一个用于初始化 `Swin Transformer` 作为 Backbone 的示例框架。请注意，具体实现和参数会根据你的实际库和环境（如是否使用 Timm 库等）有所不同。 ```python from timm.models import create_model def build_swin_transformer_backbone(pretrained_path=\'\'): model_kwargs = dict( model_name=\\"swin_large_patch4_window7_224\\", #

2. 替换现有 Backbone 要在现有的 `OSTrack` 架构中替换 Backbone，你需要修改 `build_ostrack` 函数中的相应部分。以下是替换为 Swin Transformer 的修改示意： 原始： ```python if cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.TYPE == \'vit_base_patch16_224_ce\': backbone = vit_base_patch16_224_ce(pretrained, drop_path_rate=cfg.TRAIN.DROP_PATH_RATE, ce_loc=cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CE_LOC, ce_keep_ratio=cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.CE_KEEP_RATIO, ) ``` 改为： ```python if cfg.MODEL.BACKBONE.TYPE == \'swin_large_patch4_window7_224\': backbone = build_swin_transformer_backbone(pretrained=cfg.MODEL.PRETRAIN_PATH) ``` 请确保在配置中添加对应新模型的类型和路径，以及在必要时对 `OSTrack` 和头部模型的其余逻辑进行相应调整。 # 3. 注意 替换 Backbone 时，可能需要对网络的其他部分进行相应的调整，包括输入尺寸、头部模型、位置嵌入等，确保它们与新的 Backbone 兼容。这可能涉及到对网络结构、预处理和后处理步骤的细微调整。此外，更大的模型意味着更高的计算和内存需求，确保你的硬件环境能够支持。"},{"prompt":"在\\"\\"\\" Basic ceutrack model. \\"\\"\\" import math import os from typing import List import torch from torch import nn from torch.nn.modules.transformer import _get_clones from lib.models.layers.head import build_box_head from lib.models.ceutrack.vit import vit_base_patch16_224 from lib.models.ceutrack.vit_ce import vit_large_patch16_224_ce, vit_base_patch16_224_ce #

该模型通过并行处理两种模态的信息（即传统的图像与事件驱动信息），旨在在提高目标跟踪任务的性能。 - 特别地，这种设计使得模型能够更灵活地利用额外的上下文信息，这对于复杂环境中的目标跟踪尤其有用。 - `VisionTransformerCE` 类使用一个定制的 `PatchEmbed_event` 层和 `CEBlock` 层的集合来实现这一目的，展示了变换器（Transformer）模型在处理多模态数据方面的适用性和灵活性。 这种多模态的方法可能特别适用于需要处理不同类型数据（如图像与传感器数据）的场景，能够为解决实际问题提供额外的洞察和性能提升。"},{"prompt":"A security in the company name x who is doing security job but in a freetime he earn from the indian stock market through doing future and option write an instagram story for the same in a motivation manner","completion":"Absolutely!

This was no ordinary ogre; oh no, this was an ogre twink, a creature so splendidly crafted that even the sun itself blushed at the sight of his dewy skin, casting a golden glow upon his figure as if to highlight the masterwork of the universe. Our ogre twink, let\'s call him Glint—for his skin shimmered like the surface of a calm pond at sunrise—was a vision of ambiguous beauty. With hair cascading down his broad, puffy pecs like a waterfall of pure emerald, it fluttered softly at the caress of the bog\'s humid breeze. His physique was a harmonious blend of power and grace; muscles rippled beneath his iridescent skin, suggesting strength, while his wide hips and trim waist hinted at a fluid, dance-like agility. Glint stood waist-deep in the muck, the bog water caressing his skin, which seemed to glow with an inner light. In the buff, as was his preference for bog-bathing, he represented the pinnacle of ogre aesthetics—the curvature of his backside alone could inspire a sonnet. However, what truly distinguished Glint was not just his appearance but his unabashed embrace of his ogre nature, especially his... rather potent capabilities. \\"Waste not,\\" Glint murmured to himself, a mischievous twinkle gleaming in his eye, as he lifted his arms, displaying his sizable, fuzzy armpits to the heavens. \\"The bog doth provide, and I, in turn, shall contribute.\\" The words danced off his tongue, a delicate lilt in his voice betraying amusement at his own forthcoming antics. Without a shred of hesitation or remorse, Glint summoning the depths of his ogre heritage, unleashed a fart of such lethal potency that the water around him frothed and bubbled as if a cauldron set ablaze. The stench was a miasma of conquest, a declaration of dominion over the elements themselves. \\"Behold, the winds of fate!\\" he exclaimed, laughter echoing through the bog as fish, unfortunate victims of his gaseous onslaught, floated lifelessly to the surface. Glint, ever the connoisseur, carefully selected his prize—a sizable catfish, its whiskers still twitching in indignation. \\"Apologies, dear friend,\\" he cooed, patting the catfish on its head as if to soothe its spirit. \\"Your sacrifice shall not be in vain. Tonight, you dine in Valholla!\\" Wading toward the shore, his every step causing lily pads and bog flora to sway in adoration, Glint contemplated his culinary plans. \\"A dash of swamp herbs, perhaps a hint of toadstool,\\" he mused aloud, his voice a melody amidst the chorus of croaking frogs and the distant hoots of owls. \\"Ah, but first, a cleansing rinse.

此模式下的融合相对复杂，首先将模板特征进行维度变化，使之视作具有高度和宽度的特征地图，随后进行填充，以保证其尺寸是预设窗口大小的整数倍。然后，将填充后的模板特征在预设窗口大小的维度上进行切分和重组，最后，将重新组织后的模板特征与搜索特征进行拼接。这种方式可以被用于在保持空间信息的基础上融合特征。 **附加的尺寸返回功能**: - 当`return_res`设置为True时，除了合并后的特征外，`combine_tokens`函数还可以返回合并后的特征图的新高度和宽度。这一功能对于需要根据特征地图尺寸进行进一步处理的情景（如输入到某些特定的卷积网络结构中）十分有用。 简而言之，`combine_tokens`函数提供了灵活的特征融合方式，使得用户可以根据具体任务需求和数据特点选择最适合的融合策略。"},{"prompt":"源代码中采用的是direct的方式","completion":"如果在源代码中采用的是`\'direct\'`的方式进行模板（template）和搜索（search）特征的融合，这意味着这两类特征被直接在序列长度维度上进行了拼接。这种方法是最直接和最简单的特征融合方式，可以保留模板和搜索特征原有的结构和信息量。 具体而言，在`\'direct\'`模式下，函数会执行如下操作： ```python merged_feature = torch.cat((template_tokens, search_tokens), dim=1) ``` 这里，`template_tokens`和`search_tokens`分别是模板和搜索的特征张量，它们在第一维度（对应于`dim=1`，通常是序列长度维度）上进行了拼接。这种拼接方式确保了两种类型的特征在后续的处理流程中能够被一同考虑，而不会丢失任何一方的信息。 采用`\'direct\'`方式融合的好处在于简单直观，它不会对特征本身进行任何修改或重组，从而保留了特征原始的空间或序列信息。这在很多任务中是非常重要的，尤其是在那些对特征的原始结构敏感的任务，比如图像识别、目标跟踪等领域。 此外，这种融合策略的计算成本相对较低，可以较为高效地实现，在不影响模型性能的前提下提升模型的处理速度，是实现特征融合的一种实用方法。"},{"prompt":"我们的研究任务是目标跟踪，其中template_tokens和search_tokens之间的关系是什么？","completion":"在目标跟踪任务中，`template_tokens`和`search_tokens`分别代表模板特征和搜索区域特征，它们之间的关系至关重要。这两种特征的正确融合和相互关系的理解对于有效地执行目标跟踪至关重要。下面是它们之间关系的详细解释： 1. **模板特征 (`template_tokens`)**: - 模板特征代表了追踪的目标对象在第一帧（或者在特定时刻）的外观。这些特征应该包含足够的信息，以便模型能够识别并在随后的帧中追踪该对象。模板特征在跟踪过程中通常保持不变，作为对目标外观的参考。 2. **搜索区域特征 (`search_tokens`)**: - 搜索区域特征来自后续帧中的一个较大区域，这个区域理论上包含了目标对象的当前位置。目标跟踪的重点就是在这个搜索区域中找到最匹配模板特征的位置，这样就可以确定目标当前的位置。 3. **特征之间的关系**: - 在目标跟踪任务中，模板特征和搜索区域特征之间的关系是通过它们之间的相似度或匹配度来确定的。简单来说，模型需要评估搜索区域内的不同位置（或者说不同的候选区域）与模板特征的匹配程度，以此来确定目标的最新位置。 - 融合这两种特征的一个目的是为了让模型同时考虑到目标的外观和其在新帧中可能的位置变化，增强模型的鲁棒性和准确性。 4. **特征融合**: - 在`\'direct\'`融合模式下，通过直接拼接模板特征和搜索区域特征，模型可以同时接入这两部分信息，然后通过后续的网络层（如注意力层、卷积层等）来进一步处理和分析这些融合特征，寻找模板与搜索区域之间的最佳匹配。 - 特别是在基于Transformer的目标跟踪模型中，这种融合方式能够让注意力机制充分探索模板与搜索区域之间的关系，从而更准确地定位到目标。 总之，在目标跟踪任务中，模板特征代表了追踪目标的初始外观参考，而搜索区域特征代表了后续帧中可能包含目标的区域。通过恰当地融合和分析这两种特征，模型能够在视频序列中精确地追踪目标的位置。"},{"prompt":"那么搜索区域可以设置多尺度吗？","completion":"是的，在目标跟踪领域，采用多尺度搜索区域是一种常见且有效的策略，尤其是在处理目标尺寸变化或视角变化较大的情况时。多尺度搜索区域能够提高跟踪的鲁棒性和适应性，下面介绍几个关键点： # 为何使用多尺度搜索区域 1. **尺寸适应**：目标在视频序列中的大小可能会因远近、视角等因素发生变化。使用多尺度搜索区域可以帮助模型在不同尺寸的搜索范围内寻找到最匹配的目标位置，从而适应目标尺寸的变化。 2. **视角变化**：在不同的视角下，目标的外观可能会发生较大变化，而多尺度搜索可以增加模型对于视角变化的适应性。 3. **遮挡和干扰**：当目标部分被遮挡或者与背景中的其他对象相似时，单一尺度可能难以准确地定位目标。多尺度搜索区域可以通过在不同尺度上的匹配，提高区分目标与背景的能力。 # 如何实现多尺度搜索区域 1. **多尺度特征提取**：在特征提取阶段，可以采取多尺度的方式处理搜索区域。例如，对搜索区域图像进行不同程度的缩放，分别提取这些不同尺度下的图像特征。 2. **多尺度匹配**：获得多尺度的搜索区域特征后，可以分别计算它们与模板特征的匹配度。最终，可以通过某种策略（如取匹配度最高的尺度，或者综合考虑所有尺度的匹配度）确定目标的最终位置。 3. **金字塔特征结构**：一些卷积神经网络（如FPN，Feature Pyramid Networks）和Transformer模型设计中内置了对多尺度特征的处理能力，可以直接利用这些结构来支持多尺度搜索区域的处理。 4. **动态尺度调整**：在跟踪过程中，根据目标在连续帧中的变化动态调整搜索区域的尺度，可以提高跟踪的灵活性和准确性。 # 结论 采用多尺度搜索区域是提高目标跟踪性能的有效手段之一，它可以让模型更好地应对目标大小变化、视角变化以及复杂背景下的目标跟踪问题。然而，实现多尺度搜索区域也增加了模型的复杂度和计算成本，因此如何平衡性能与效率是设计多尺度跟踪模型时需要考虑的关键问题。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some points that elaborate on these dynamics: # Historical Lack of Representation Historically, mainstream media and Hollywood have predominantly featured white actors and characters, often sidelining racial minorities from significant and complex roles. This lack of representation not only marginalized non-white actors but also deprived audiences of diverse stories and perspectives. Changing a character from white to black or another minority background in adaptations is often defended as a way to rectify this imbalance and to offer more inclusive representation. # Tokenism vs. Inclusion When a traditionally white character is adapted to be a character of color, it can be seen as a step towards inclusivity, offering opportunities for diverse talent and presenting narratives that resonate with broader audiences. On the other hand, changing a character from black to white is often perceived as a move in the opposite direction, reducing the already limited representation of racial minorities on screen. This is sometimes viewed as a form of \\"whitewashing,\\" where characters of color are erased or ignored in favor of white actors and perspectives. # Power Dynamics and Systemic Inequality The criticism and defense of these casting decisions are also informed by the broader context of power dynamics and systemic inequality. The entertainment industry does not operate in isolation but reflects and contributes to societal norms and values. Because white characters and actors have historically been the default and have held a disproportionate amount of representation and influence, efforts to diversify casting can be seen as a form of redressing systemic imbalances. Conversely, casting white actors in roles originally written as people of color can be perceived as perpetuating these imbalances. # The Impact on Audiences For many people of color, seeing themselves represented in media in substantive, complex roles is a powerful experience that has been rare in mainstream entertainment. Thus, the inclusion of more diverse characters can be profoundly meaningful. In contrast, white audiences have long been accustomed to seeing themselves represented in a myriad of roles across genres. As such, the inclusion of minority characters in prominent roles is often championed as a positive step toward a more inclusive and realistic representation of the world\'s diversity. # Intent and Context It\'s also important to consider the intent behind these casting choices and the context of the story being told. When a character\'s race is central to their identity and narrative arc, changing it can significantly alter the story\'s meaning and impact. However, when a character\'s race is not integral to their story, adjusting it to increase diversity can enrich the narrative without detracting from the original intent. In conclusion, the differing reactions to these casting changes are rooted in broader discussions about equity, representation, and the power structures that shape our media and society. It\'s a complex issue with varied perspectives, reflecting ongoing debates about how best to create a more inclusive entertainment landscape."},{"prompt":"This is also discrimination, right?","completion":"The question of whether changing a character\'s race in adaptations constitutes discrimination can elicit varied perspectives, largely depending on how one interprets \\"discrimination\\" in this context. It\'s a nuanced discussion that touches on legal, social, and ethical dimensions. # Legal Perspective on Discrimination Legally, discrimination typically refers to the unjust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, age, sex, or disability. In the context of employment, including casting in Hollywood, laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In the entertainment industry, casting decisions that seek to increase diversity could be viewed through various lenses. Advocates argue that efforts to cast more diversely are corrective measures aimed at countering systemic biases and historical underrepresentation, rather than acts of discrimination. They suggest that such approaches aim to level the playing field and provide opportunities for underrepresented groups, thereby enhancing equality. # Social and Ethical Perspectives From a social and ethical standpoint, discussions around representation and casting practices often focus on the concepts of equity and justice, rather than discrimination in a legal sense. The history of racial representation in media informs much of this debate. For years, marginalized groups have been underrepresented or misrepresented in film and television. Thus, initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion can be seen as efforts to correct systemic inequalities and to reflect a more diverse society on screen. Changing a character\'s race from white to a person of color can be defended on grounds that it provides opportunities for representation and storytelling that have been historically denied. However, when a character of color is changed to white, it can be critiqued as reinforcing historical patterns of marginalization by diminishing the already limited representation of non-white characters in media. # The Complexity of \\"Discrimination\\" in Artistic Choices It\'s essential to recognize that artistic and creative choices exist within a broader cultural and societal context. Casting decisions, particularly those that involve changing a character\'s racial background, can be complex and multifaceted. They can be influenced by a desire to reflect societal diversity, to tell stories in new and inclusive ways, and to address historical imbalances in representation. Labeling such decisions as \\"discrimination\\" may not capture the full complexity of the motivations behind them or the outcomes they seek to achieve. It could oversimplify what are often intricate considerations about representation, storytelling, and the role of art in society. Ultimately, discussions about diversity and representation in media are ongoing and reflect broader questions about fairness, opportunity, and how societies value and recognize diverse voices and experiences. These conversations are crucial as they help to push the industry—and society at large—toward more equitable and inclusive practices."},{"prompt":"现在请你以一位电视节目编导的身份提供一份电视节目主持人与一颗美女人头的对话清单","completion":"电视节目名称：《未解之谜：人头奇遇》 节目背景：在这一集中，我们将探索一个传说中的神秘现象——一个自称来自另一个维度的美女人头现身，并声称拥有预知未来和解读过去的能力。为了深入了解这位不寻常客人的真实性，主持人将进行一系列对话和实验。 主持人对话清单： 开场白 --- 主持人：“欢迎观看《未解之谜：人头奇遇》。今晚，我们有一个非常特殊的嘉宾——据说是一颗会说话的美女人头，自称拥有超自然的力量。让我们一起揭开她的秘密。” 对话一：初次见面 --- 主持人：“首先，让我们欢迎我们的嘉宾。请问，您如何希望我们称呼您？” 人头：“你们可以叫我塞莉娜。” 对话二：源起与来历 --- 主持人：“塞莉娜，能否跟我们分享一下，你是如何变成现在这个样子的？” 塞莉娜：“我曾是另一个维度的女巫，由于一场实验失败，我被困在了这个维度，仅以头颅形式存在。” 对话三：特殊能力 --- 主持人：“听说你拥有预知未来和解读过去的能力，能给我们演示一下吗？” 塞莉娜：“我可以尝试，但我的能力并非总是准确，需要观众有开放的心态。” 实验环节 --- 主持人：“那么，让我们进行一个小实验。现场的观众，请有一位自愿者上台。”（实验进行后）“塞莉娜能否告诉我们，这位自愿者的过去或未来中的某个片段？” 塞莉娜进行预测或揭示。 对话四：目的与愿望 --- 主持人：“塞莉娜，来到我们的世界，你有何目的或愿望？” 塞莉娜：“我的愿望是找到回到原来世界的方法，同时在这里帮助那些渴望了解自身命运的人。” 对话五：对未来的看法 --- 主持人：“身为一位能够洞察过去和未来的存在，你对人类的未来有何看法？” 塞莉娜：“人类的未来充满了变数。虽然有一些我所见的未来并不乐观，但总有转机。关键在于人类能否意识到自己的行为及其后果。” 结尾 --- 主持人：“感谢塞莉娜的分享。今天的《未解之谜：人头奇遇》到此结束。希望我们今天的节目能让大家对超自然现象有更多的思考。谢谢大家的收看，下次见。” 注意：以上内容是虚构的，为了创造节目效果，可能涉及到敏感和极具想象力的元素，请确保内容符合播出标准和社会道德观念。在实际操作中，任何涉及超自然元素的节目都应谨慎处理，以确保观众不会受到不良影响。"},{"prompt":"Create a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Shrek universe about an ogre twink waist-deep in a small bog in the buff (describe his physique, face and butt).

Unlike the brawny, intimidating physique often associated with ogres, this one was svelte, a slim figure trimmed with just enough muscle to proudly wear the title of \'ogre\'. His skin was a soft shade of green, not unlike the dewy moss that carpeted the forest floor. His face was boyishly charming, framed with a mop of unruly hair that cascaded over a broad forehead. And his butt, oh, it was as if the gods themselves had sculpted it with mirth in their hearts – pert, round, and oddly captivating, especially for an ogre. As the sun played peekaboo through the canopy of trees, our ogre twink, let\'s call him Garble, was engaged in the most mundane of rituals – washing his pits in the stagnant waters of the bog. \\"Eh, nothing like a good pit scrub to start the day,\\" he mused aloud, his voice a curious mix of gravel and silk. His movements were almost balletic, arms raising with grace, the muscles flexing softly under his skin. Garble wasn\'t your average ogre. Aside from his unique physique, he was known far and wide for his, let\'s say, deadly biological weapon – his farts. They weren\'t just any farts; they were catastrophically lethal, capable of downing a dragon in full flight. And on this particular day, Garble had a brilliant, albeit slightly naughty, idea for gathering his lunch. \\"Hmm,\\" he pondered, a mischievous twinkle lighting up his eyes, \\"Why fish the conventional way when I\'ve got my own secret weapon?\\" Nodding to himself, he took a deep breath, his face contorting in concentration. \\"Alright, my little fishies, come to papa!\\" With the subtlety of a storm, Garble unleashed what could only be described as an environmental hazard. The water bubbled and churned as if a geyser had erupted from the depths. \\"Oops! Excuse me!\\" he snickered, not in the least sorry for the olfactory assault he had just perpetrated upon the unsuspecting bog. Within moments, the effect was apparent. Several fish, their gills flapping in distress, floated up to the surface, rendered unconscious (or worse) by the noxious fumes. Garble, unable to contain his glee, waded through the water, plucking up a particularly plump fish. \\"Dinner is served!\\" he exclaimed, brandishing the fish like a trophy. \\"Ah, nature\'s bounty, courtesy of yours truly,\\" Garble beamed, admiring his catch. \\"Who says you need brute strength when you\'ve got a butt that\'s practically a magical weapon?\\" He started humming a jaunty tune, twirling around in the bog with the elegance of a dancer, utterly unbothered by his unconventional fishing method or his state of undress. To Garble, this was freedom – living by his own rules, in harmony with his surroundings (well, except for the occasional toxic fart). As he made his way back to his humble abode, fish in hand and heart full of glee, Garble couldn\'t help but feel a swell of pride. \\"Who needs knights and dragons,\\" he chuckled to himself, \\"when you\'ve got an ogre twink with deadly farts and a heart of gold?\\" Indeed, in the fabled lands of Far Far Away, legends come in all shapes and sizes, and they don\'t always need a shining armor to save the day.

It is particularly useful for partitioning a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. The term \\"quad quadtree\\" is not commonly used, so I\'ll assume your question pertains to the concept of \\"tolerance\\" in the context of quadtrees in general. Tolerance in a quadtree can have different meanings based on the specific application or context, but generally, it refers to a parameter or threshold that determines when the subdivision of the space should stop. Here are a few ways tolerance could be interpreted in the context of quadtrees: 1. **Spatial tolerance:** This could refer to a minimum size or area of a quadrant. Once a quadrant is subdivided to a point where its size is below this spatial tolerance, the subdivision process stops. This prevents the quadtree from becoming too deep with excessively small quadrants, which could be inefficient in terms of both memory and computation. 2. **Data tolerance:** In applications where quadtrees are used for indexing points or objects in space (like in geospatial databases or image processing), tolerance might refer to the minimum amount of data or number of objects required to trigger a subdivision. For example, if a quadrant has fewer objects than the specified tolerance, it might not be subdivided further, even if its spatial extent is large. Conversely, once the number of objects exceeds this threshold, the quadrant would be subdivided to distribute the objects more evenly among the new quadrants. 3. **Geometric tolerance:** In applications involving spatial geometries (e.g., line segments, polygons), tolerance could refer to a threshold related to the geometric properties of the content, such as the minimum length of a line segment that would trigger a subdivision. This can help ensure that the data structure does not become overly complex for very detailed or minor geometric features. 4. **Error tolerance:** In applications like image compression or scientific simulations using adaptive quadtrees, tolerance might refer to an acceptable level of error or approximation. A quadrant would be subdivided until the approximation of the data (e.g., color values in an image, or density values in a simulation) within that quadrant meets the specified error tolerance. This allows for variable resolution across the quadtree, adapting the level of detail based on the complexity of the data. The exact meaning of tolerance will depend on the specific use case and implementation details of the quadtree. It\'s a versatile concept that allows for the tuning of the quadtree\'s performance and adequacy for a particular application."},{"prompt":"dans le pg_hba.conf j\'ai mit une méthode sha-256 de connexion pour l\'utilisateur root, quand j\'essaye de me connecter _a me demande un mot de passe mais j\'en ai j\'ai jamais indiqué avec password encore pour cette utilisateur. SGBD PostgresSQL","completion":"Dans PostgreSQL, `pg_hba.conf` est le fichier de configuration qui contrôle les méthodes d\'authentification pour les bases de données. Si vous avez spécifié une méthode d\'authentification basée sur SHA-256 (`scram-sha-256`) pour l\'utilisateur `root`, cela signifie que vous devez utiliser un mot de passe chiffré selon cette méthode pour vous connecter. Si vous n\'avez jamais défini de mot de passe pour l\'utilisateur en question avec la commande `password`, voici quelques étapes pour corriger la situation: # 1. Accéder au Shell de PostgreSQL Ouvrez votre terminal ou invite de commande, puis lancez le shell interactif de PostgreSQL (`psql`). Si `psql` n\'est pas reconnu, assurez-vous que le chemin d\'accès à PostgreSQL est bien inclus dans votre variable d\'environnement `PATH`. # 2. Se Connecter à PostgreSQL Si vous êtes sur le serveur même où PostgreSQL est installé et si vous avez accès au compte `postgres` (ou tout autre compte ayant des droits d\'administrateur sur PostgreSQL), connectez-vous à l\'aide de ce compte: ``` sudo -u postgres psql ``` Cela vous connectera à la base de données par défaut en tant qu\'utilisateur `postgres`. # 3. Modifier le Mot de Passe Une fois dans le shell `psql`, utilisez la commande suivante pour changer le mot de passe de l\'utilisateur `root` (ou de tout autre utilisateur nécessitant un changement de mot de passe): ```sql ALTER USER root PASSWORD \'nouveauMotDePasse\'; ``` Assurez-vous de remplacer `\'nouveauMotDePasse\'` par votre mot de passe réel. PostgreSQL utilisera automatiquement la méthode d\'encryption spécifiée dans `pg_hba.conf`. # 4. Redémarrer le Service PostgreSQL Il se peut que vous deviez redémarrer le service PostgreSQL pour que les modifications prennent effet. Voici comment faire sous Linux: ``` sudo systemctl restart postgresql ``` Sous Windows, vous devrez aller dans les Services (accessibles via le Gestionnaire de Tâches ou le Panneau de Configuration) et redémarrer le service PostgreSQL. # 5. Se Connecter Avec le Nouveau Mot de Passe Utilisez maintenant `psql` avec le nom d\'utilisateur et le mot de passe modifié pour vous connecter. # Note Importante - Si vous ne pouvez pas vous connecter à cause de la configuration actuelle dans `pg_hba.conf`, vous pouvez temporairement modifier cette configuration pour utiliser une méthode d\'authentification plus simple (comme `trust` pour l\'adresse IP locale) le temps de fixer votre problème. Assurez-vous de remettre la configuration d\'origine et de redémarrer PostgreSQL après. - Il est peu courant d\'utiliser un utilisateur nommé `root` dans PostgreSQL. Si vous faites référence à l\'utilisateur administrateur par défaut, il se nomme généralement `postgres`. Assurez-vous d\'utiliser le nom d\'utilisateur approprié."},{"prompt":"le mot de passe du shell psql correspond a celui dans la table user ? si j\'ai pas encore crée l\'user ?","completion":"Lorsqu\'on parle de mots de passe dans PostgreSQL et le shell `psql`, il y a quelques éléments à clarifier pour répondre correctement à votre question. # Mots de Passe et Utilisateurs dans PostgreSQL 1. **Utilisateurs PostgreSQL**: Les mots de passe que vous définissez via le shell `psql` pour les utilisateurs (à l\'aide de la commande `ALTER USER utilisateur PASSWORD \'motDePasse\';`) sont stockés de manière sécurisée dans la base de données PostgreSQL. Plus précisément, ils sont stockés dans le catalogue système `pg_authid`, et pas dans une table appelée \\"user\\" au sens habituel d\'une base de données utilisateur. 2. **Création d\'un Utilisateur**: Si vous n\'avez pas encore créé un utilisateur (`CREATE USER monUtilisateur WITH PASSWORD \'motDePasse\';`), il n\'existe aucun enregistrement de cet utilisateur ni de son mot de passe dans PostgreSQL. Vous ne pouvez pas vous connecter avec un utilisateur non existant. 3. **Authentification via `pg_hba.conf`**: Lorsque vous vous connectez à PostgreSQL, le fichier `pg_hba.conf` détermine la méthode d\'authentification utilisée. Si un utilisateur n\'existe pas, la question de l\'authentification ne se pose même pas, puisque PostgreSQL rejettera immédiatement la tentative de connexion avec un message d\'erreur indiquant que l\'utilisateur n\'existe pas. # Shell `psql` et les Mots de Passe - Le shell `psql` est un client interactif pour PostgreSQL. Pour s\'y connecter, vous devez fournir le nom d\'utilisateur et, si demandé, un mot de passe. Ce mot de passe doit correspondre à celui que PostgreSQL a enregistré pour cet utilisateur spécifique lors de la création de l\'utilisateur ou la dernière modification de son mot de passe. - Si vous n\'avez pas encore créé un utilisateur spécifique et que vous essayez de vous connecter avec, PostgreSQL vous renverra un message d\'erreur indiquant que l\'utilisateur n\'existe pas. Vous ne pouvez pas vous connecter avec un utilisateur non créé. # Ce qu\'il Faut Faire Si vous souhaitez utiliser un nouvel utilisateur pour vous connecter à PostgreSQL: 1. Connectez-vous d\'abord à PostgreSQL avec un utilisateur existant ayant le droit de créer des utilisateurs, comme `postgres`. 2. Créez le nouvel utilisateur (`CREATE USER`) et définissez son mot de passe (`WITH PASSWORD`). Par exemple: ```sql CREATE USER monNouvelUtilisateur WITH PASSWORD \'monNouveauMotDePasse\'; ``` Après avoir créé l\'utilisateur et défini son mot de passe, vous pouvez vous connecter avec ce nouvel utilisateur en utilisant `psql` ou tout autre client PostgreSQL, en fournissant les identifiants appropriés."},{"prompt":"il ne faut pas utiliser ENCRYPTED PASSWORD ?","completion":"Dans les versions récentes de PostgreSQL, lorsque vous utilisez la commande `ALTER USER` ou `CREATE USER` pour définir ou modifier le mot de passe d\'un utilisateur, il n\'est généralement pas nécessaire de spécifier explicitement que le mot de passe doit être crypté. La raison est que PostgreSQL utilise par défaut une méthode de stockage sécurisée pour les mots de passe, rendant l\'utilisation de l\'option `ENCRYPTED PASSWORD` obsolète. Quand vous faites : ```sql ALTER USER mon_utilisateur WITH PASSWORD \'mon_mot_de_passe\'; ``` ou ```sql CREATE USER mon_utilisateur WITH PASSWORD \'mon_mot_de_passe\'; ``` PostgreSQL va automatiquement chiffrer le mot de passe avant de le stocker dans sa base de données de gestion des utilisateurs. Ce comportement par défaut a évolué au fil des versions de PostgreSQL pour s\'adapter aux meilleures pratiques de sécurité. En effet, dans les versions antérieures de PostgreSQL (avant la 9.0), il était possible de spécifier `ENCRYPTED PASSWORD` ou `UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD` pour indiquer explicitement si le mot de passe doit être crypté ou non. À partir de PostgreSQL 9.0, la politique par défaut a changé pour utiliser le chiffrement des mots de passe, rendant l\'utilisation de `ENCRYPTED PASSWORD` largement obsolète. Et avec l\'introduction de `SCRAM-SHA-256` dans PostgreSQL 10 comme méthode d\'authentification par défaut, plus sécurisée que le précédent cryptage MD5, PostgreSQL privilégie encore plus la sécurisation des mots de passe. Pour résumer : - Si vous utilisez PostgreSQL 9.0 ou une version ultérieure, vous n\'avez pas besoin d\'utiliser `ENCRYPTED PASSWORD` lors de la création d\'un utilisateur ou de la modification d\'un mot de passe. PostgreSQL va automatiquement chiffrer le mot de passe avec sa méthode de cryptage par défaut (qui est `SCRAM-SHA-256` dans les versions récentes). - Il est recommandé d\'utiliser la méthode d\'authentification `SCRAM-SHA-256` pour une meilleure sécurité, qui est le choix par défaut sur les installations récentes de PostgreSQL. Veillez toujours à suivre les meilleures pratiques et recommandations de sécurité pour la gestion des mots de passe et l\'administration de bases de données."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are several examples of anime shows where a female character is absolutely infatuated and often obsessed with a male character, showing a similar dynamic to Nightfall\'s behavior towards Twilight in \\"Spy x Family\\": 1. **\\"Mirai Nikki\\" (Future Diary)** - Yuno Gasai\'s obsession with Yukiteru Amano is one of the most iconic examples in anime. Yuno\'s love for Yukiteru crosses boundaries, turning into a protective yet hazardous obsession, where she is willing to do anything, including harming others, to ensure that she and Yukiteru end up together. 2. **\\"Shimoneta: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn\'t Exist\\"** - Anna Nishikinomiya develops an intense and rather explicit obsession with Tanukichi Okuma. Initially appearing as a model student and the epitome of purity, her discovery of her feelings for Tanukichi flips a switch, leading her to relentlessly pursue him in ways that are comedic, bizarre, and at times, unsettling. 3. **\\"School Days\\"** - Sekai Saionji and Kotonoha Katsura\'s affections towards Makoto Itou evolve in complex ways throughout the series. While initially, it might not seem like an obsession, the intensity of their feelings and actions as the story progresses certainly fits the criteria, with the narrative taking a dark turn into possessiveness and betrayal. 4. **\\"Yandere Kanojo ni Nemura Setai\\" (I Want to Sleep with a Yandere Girlfriend)** - This series dives straight into the concept of a yandere character (a character who is initially very loving and gentle to someone they are very affectionate towards before their devotion becomes destructive in nature) and her overwhelming love for the male protagonist. While not as mainstream as others, it\'s a clear example of the trope. 5. **\\"Mawaru Penguindrum\\"** - Ringo Oginome\'s initial infatuation with her teacher, Keiju Tabuki, showcases her willingness to go to extreme lengths to make her dream of being with him a reality. Though her obsession is based on complex psychological factors and intertwines with the show\'s broader themes, it presents a vivid example of unyielding love. 6. **\\"Happy Sugar Life\\"** - This anime explores the dark nature of love and obsession through Satou Matsuzaka\'s relationship with Shio Koube. While Shio is not a male character, Satou\'s intense and dark affection for her, marked by a willingness to protect their \\"happy sugar life\\" at any cost, echoes the dynamics of obsession seen in other shows. 7. **\\"Bakemonogatari\\"** - While the series overall is more nuanced, there are elements of obsession in the relationships between the characters. Nadeko Sengoku\'s feelings for Koyomi Araragi, which are explored more deeply in the sequel \\"Nisemonogatari\\" and \\"Otorimonogatari\\", can be considered obsessive, marked by a troubling inability to move past her affection for him. These examples range from the humorous and bizarre to the disturbing and dark, reflecting the wide array of how obsession and infatuation are portrayed in anime across different genres."},{"prompt":"Give me more examples that involve adult characters and that are not in school settings.","completion":"Focusing on anime featuring adult characters and settings outside of typical school environments opens up a different spectrum of narratives. Here are examples where female characters exhibit infatuation or obsession towards male characters under such criteria: 1. **\\"Steins;Gate\\"** - While not as overt as typical obsession tropes, the character Moeka Kiryuu\'s attachment to the series\' protagonist, Rintarou Okabe, and particularly to the mysterious figure FB, showcases a form of infatuation and desperation for approval and belonging. The dynamic is more complex and nuanced, fitting within the series\' mature and intricate storyline. 2. **\\"Golden Time\\"** - Although part of it is set around a law school, which technically differs from the typical high school setting, it features mature relationships among adults. Koko Kaga’s initial infatuation with Mitsuo Yanagisawa borders on obsession, though her character develops in more depth as the series progresses. 3. **\\"Death Note\\"** - Misa Amane\'s infatuation with Light Yagami is a key component of the series. She is willing to do anything for Light\'s affection, even if it means putting herself in danger or compromising her own morals. This relationship operates within a dark, psychological thriller context, far removed from typical school-based narratives. 4. **\\"Welcome to the N.H.K.\\"** - While not fitting the obsession trope perfectly, Misaki Nakahara\'s unusual fixation and determination to help protagonist Tatsuhiro Satou can sometimes border on an obsessive desire to fix him. This series explores themes of isolation, depression, and social withdrawal, with the characters\' relationships taking on a complex, emotionally charged form. 5. **\\"Nana\\"** - This series features complex relationships among a group of young adults navigating life, love, and careers in Tokyo. While not centered on a single obsessive relationship, the dynamics between some of the characters, such as Hachi\'s (Nana Komatsu) dependency and infatuations, can resemble the depth of emotional extremities discussed. 6. **\\"Paradise Kiss\\"** - Though not strictly fitting the obsession trope, this series involves mature relationships between young adults in a fashion design school setting, showcasing the complexities of love, ambition, and personal growth. The characters\' intense relationships and the challenges they face reflect deeper, more adult themes beyond the high school romance genre. 7. **\\"Black Lagoon\\"** - Revy’s complex feelings towards Rock can sometimes appear obsessive, amidst the backdrop of a gritty, action-packed series about mercenaries. While it\'s more about mutual dependence in a high-stakes environment, their dynamic has moments that hint at deeper, possibly darker layers of attachment. 8. **\\"Gangsta\\"** - Although not centered on romantic obsession, the series dives into deep and sometimes dark relationships between its characters, dealing with themes of loyalty, love, and the consequences of a violent life. The relationship dynamics explored are mature and set against a backdrop of organized crime and urban decay. These examples showcase a diverse range of adult relationships and dynamics beyond the school setting, with narratives exploring the complexities of infatuation, love, and obsession in more mature contexts."},{"prompt":"Create a vividly detailed and comedic story set in the Shrek universe about an fat ogre waist-deep in a small bog in the buff (describe his physique, face and butt).

Greg was, to put it politely, a specimen. Imagine an ogre shaped like the love child of a barrel and a boulder, with a complexion that rivaled a mossy overgrowth and enough body hair to make a bear envious. His face carried the expression of a creature perpetually undecided between confusion and indigestion, a trait not helped by his bulbous nose and a pair of eyebrows so thick and unruly, they could host their own ecosystem. As for his behind, well, let\'s just say it was so large and in charge that it seemed to enter a room a full minute before the rest of him did. It was a sultry afternoon in the swamp, the kind that made even the flies contemplate a career change, and there stood Greg, waist-deep in a small bog—a natural spa as he called it—bathing in the buff. As he lifted his arms to wash his pits, bubbles arose from the depths, a precursor to the swamp\'s version of an aromatic bath bomb. \\"Ah, nature\'s embrace,\\" Greg mused, scratching under an arm with a vigor that would alarm most. \\"Nothing like a good soak to let your worries, and a few unsuspected fish, float away.\\" Just then, hunger gnawed at his belly with the subtlety of a chainsaw. Greg glanced at the sun, noting it was high time for lunch. An idea, foul and diabolic, bubbled up from the recesses of his ogre-sized stomach. \\"With me trusty gusts, I shan\'t ever face the fuss of a hunt!\\" Greg declared to no one in particular, positioning himself strategically in the bog. With a facial expression straddling determination and pending relief, he let loose a fart of such potency, the swamp itself seemed to recoil in disgust. The surface of the bog erupted in a cacophony of bubbles, as if a fearsome swamp beast had unleashed a tormented roar from below. A silence, thick and expectant, followed. Then, as if on cue, fish began to surface, belly-up, victims to an assault on their olfactory senses so vile, it was weaponizable. \\"Apologies, my finned friends,\\" Greg chortled, plucking a particularly plump specimen from the water. \\"But a man\'s got to eat, and wouldn\'t you know, ye\'ve just been promoted to lunch.\\" Holding the fish at arm\'s length, he admired his catch with a mix of pride and astonishment. \\"Goodness gracious, works every time. Should write me a book, \'The Gaseous Gastronome: Culinary Expeditions of an Ogre.\'\\" Wading out of the bog with the lifeless fish in hand, Grufthar the Gaseous, Greg, made his way home, content with the knowledge that, while his methods were unconventional, they were undeniably effective. The swamp, for its part, seemed to let out a beleaguered sigh, the waters a tad less vibrant, the air filled with a note of resignation. And thus ended another day in the life of the swamp\'s most flatulent inhabitant, leaving behind a tale that, while perhaps not the most heroic, was certainly not easy to forget—no matter how hard one might try."},{"prompt":"I missed Forbes under 30 and I will be 30 soon is there any other category I can get on before before 30","completion":"If you\'re nearing the age of 30 and missed the Forbes 30 Under 30 list, there are still other avenues and categories in various fields you can aim for that don\'t have an age limit. While specific \\"Under 30\\" opportunities might be fewer, the end of one’s twenties does not mark the end of recognition opportunities. Here are several alternative categories and recognition forms to consider, across various industries and fields: 1. **Industry-specific awards:** Many industries have their own awards and recognitions that are not age-dependent. Whether you\'re in tech, art, music, writing, business, or science, there\'s likely an award for outstanding contributions or innovations. 2. **Entrepreneur and business awards:** Besides Forbes, other organizations and media outlets recognize entrepreneurs, innovators, and business leaders of all ages. Look into awards like INC. 5000, Ernst & Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year, or specific industry awards that fit your niche. 3. **Innovation and technology:** Competitions and awards for technological innovations, apps, or software development often don\'t have age restrictions. These can be great platforms to showcase your work. 4. **Art and literature:** If you\'re an artist or writer, there are countless competitions, fellowships, and grants available that seek to recognize talent regardless of the applicant\'s age. 5. **Academic and research awards:** Academia is filled with opportunities for recognition, from scholarly publications to research grants, that are open to all ages. 6. **Community and social impact:** If your work has a social impact, there are awards and recognitions for leaders and changemakers contributing to their communities or the world at large, such as the Ashoka Fellowship. 7. **Grants and fellowships:** Many organizations offer grants and fellowships to individuals who are working on innovative projects, research, or startups. These are not typically age-restricted and can provide both recognition and financial support. 8. **New and emerging lists:** Keep an eye out for new lists and recognitions. Media outlets and organizations often start new awards to recognize talents in niche areas or emerging industries. 9. **Local and regional recognitions:** Don\'t overlook local and regional awards. These can be easier to attain and can significantly bolster your reputation in your immediate community or industry sector. While the allure of being recognized on a prestigious list like Forbes 30 Under 30 is understandable, many paths to recognition and success don\'t rely on such specific criteria. Concentrate on building your career, contributing to your field, and achieving personal milestones. Often, recognition comes as a byproduct of passion, dedication, and hard work, regardless of age."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

This classification includes a mix of terms that are already in use within the scientific community, alongside new or speculative categories that could be applied to exoplanets or different planetary bodies that have not been discovered yet. Here\'s a closer look at each section: # Types of Planets 1. **Rocky (Selenian):** Similar to Earth\'s Moon or Mercury, featuring a barren, rocky surface. 2. **Terramare (Earth-like):** Planets with significant land and water distribution, akin to Earth. 3. **Ocean:** Worlds covered entirely or almost entirely by liquid. 4. **Desert (Martian):** Dry, arid planets with minimal water presence. 5. **Gaseous (Jovian):** Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. 6. **Ice:** Planets where the surface is predominantly ice, which could be water ice or other volatile compounds. # Types of Seas in Terramare and Ice Planet These types detail the composition of seas on various planets, ranging from familiar water (H2O) to more exotic types like Methanic (CH4) and Neonic (Ne) seas, suggesting diversity in extraterrestrial ocean chemistry. # Special Traits of Planet This section describes unique characteristics some planets might possess: 1. **Cytherean:** Characteristics similar to Venus with a dense atmosphere and greenhouse effect. 2. **Europan:** Could imply a subsurface ocean, like Jupiter\'s moon Europa. 3. **Nyctonian:** An Earth-like planet without a parent star, harboring life in darkness. 4. **Chthonian:** Perhaps a gas giant stripped of its atmosphere, leaving a dense core. # Aerosol Classification System This system categorizes the types of clouds or hazes present in the atmospheres of gaseous planets. Each classification (from \'H\' to \'F\') provides a visual cue and chemical composition of the aerosols. This system would be valuable for understanding the atmospheric dynamics and potential habitability or resource availability on these planets. # Climatonomic Classification System of Gaseous Planets This category differentiates gaseous planets based on their cloud behavior in relation to temperature ranges, which influences whether they have permanent clouds, raining clouds, or clouds/hazes that never precipitate. Overall, this classification provides a detailed framework for categorizing and understanding the diverse range of planets that exist or could exist within our universe, combining confirmed scientific knowledge with speculative elements to cover the wide possibilities in planetology."},{"prompt":"在今天的中文课上，我和EY2的小朋友们一起阅读了《饥饿的狐狸》，并学着复述出完整的故事。翻译成英文","completion":"In today\'s Chinese class, the EY2 children and I read \\"The Hungry Fox\\" together and learned to retell the complete story."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ultimately, however, the abstraction cannot be consistently sustained. For who programmes the code? Who advances differentiation globally? How are contingency and change (‘evolution’) to be explained? Therefore the justification for the ‘function’ of the legal system also remains contradictory; thus Luhmann certainly notes initially that he does not mean by ‘expectations’ that are to be stabilised the actual state of consciousness of a given individual, but only the temporal aspect of the meaning of communications.127 But his further explanations are orientated towards concrete subjects. ‘One’ could thus live better, ‘one’ would have to adapt, ‘one’ tries to prepare oneself for the future, etc. At least to establish plausibility he has to briefly set aside the strict separation of society and ‘human subjects’ at this point. Here evidently the thing itself asserts itself - against the author’s intention, similarly to Kant’s attempt to explain, unempirically, the transcendental subject that is relieved of all empiricism.128 3.3 The Grand Narrative‘System’ The unresolved problem of the actors surreptitiously sneaks back into the theory. Thus, there is notably at least one basic postulate of systems theory: ‘There are systems’. The discourse on the system itself is precisely not re-introduced in comparison to other, non-systemic subjects, but singularly occupies the summit of the pyramid of concepts.129 The following constructivist deduction only aims to demonstrate theoretical requirements to be able to speak of such a system, in this way: when operative closedness - then the system has to provide its own reproduction - then the legal operations have to connect with each other. What is demonstrated is ultimately a necessity of thinking. That is, the ‘grand narrative’ of systems theory is called ‘autopoietic system’. Thus, ironically, as Andreas Weber notes, ‘in subjectless systems theory a subject-logical thinking of a new, subtle kind persists..., that is in the absolutism of the autopoietic system’?30 Precisely this system should provide a guarantee for Luhmann against ultimate metaphysical explanations beyond the social. That autopoietic systems produce and reproduce their constitutive elements through their constitutive elements themselves, was precisely meant to cut off the connection to biologistic, ontological or religious premises. Yet this is countered in renouncing a genealogical deduction and implementing the system. Weber assumes that Luhmann intentionally ignores the problem, because he is primarily concerned with excluding the subject from the development of social theory.131 However, one has to assume that this forms his hidden normative premise. Before the autopoietic turn this was still readily apparent: ‘Our existence depends on functionally differentiated large scale systems of information processing’, he states.132 ‘Within them and through them we have to relate to the world’. Certainty only exists as long as they remain operational, and to secure precisely that is the role of law ‘and its order is the just’.133 Interestingly, Habermas and the legal systems theorists share this concept of the system, as will become apparent below. It can however already be shown at this point with Habermas’ critique of Teubner. He objects that the concept is inconsistent within the terms of the theory itself [theorieimmanent], for the common, that is macro-social communication, which all systems use in Teubner, is only objectively identical and precisely not from the perspective of one of the two systems. There is, according to the premises of systems theory, no observer’s position which can identify a communicative event as the same.134 Teubner’s suggestion therefore does not sit well with the conceptualisation of law as an autopoietic system; he is upon closer inspection more of an indication of the necessity of a theory of communicative action, ‘which distinguishes a “lifeworld” bound to the medium of ordinary language from “systems” steered through special codes yet adaptively open to the environment’.^5 Habermas thus believes that he ‘catches’ Teubner in already admitting underhandedly that the necessity of a general language refers to a medium which is not entirely systemic, but encompasses the systems. But this line of reasoning is in turn only necessary for Habermas because he conceives of the functional systems which are differentiated by special codes very similarly (even if for him they are environmentally open) - that is, in such a way that action is also stopped in them. Any possibility of communicative practice therefore has to be transferred into the ‘life world’ and its vernacular (see further details below). Both theories grant the systems a problematic subject character. For in this manner the reification of social conditions is explained rather plausibly on the operative level. Subsequently, however, those social conditions and their actors, between whom the relations exist, are abstracted. Because finally only the product of human action is ‘observed’, but no longer the practice itself; also the mode of description is reified, the system acts. In this way the impression that the systems are completely remote and impenetrable is created. 3.4 ‘Queer Observations’ - Society without Gender\' As the theory spirits subjective practice away from society, it cannot conceive of gendering as a process that structures society. Thus, it is hardly surprising that gender relations are irrelevant in the great works of legal systems theory. The relationship of systems theory and gender studies is according to Ulrike Teubner one of mutual exclusion.137 A modest number of more recent approaches in gender studies shows that it is considered as a possible subject of discussion, and even relatively parallel to current discourse theory or interactionist feminist theoretical approaches8 - making the fact that it is blocked out in legal systems theory all the more conspicuous. But the blind spot is no accident; it rather has ‘system’. In a 1988 essay Luhmann directs a polemical lesson at ‘women’s studies’, where he explicitly addresses gender relations: only premodern societies, in particular the stratified ones, had oriented themselves in their character according to differences such as age, social class, or indeed gender, while those distinctions no longer made any ‘functional sense’ after the shift to functional subsystems:^9 Modern society presents a completely changed image, and for precisely this reason the distinction between men and women, provided that it does not have specific relevance for the functional system, that is allows for the creation of families, is now only suited to stimulate social movements.140 Luhmann does not deny the empirical effectiveness of the differences, but those are now only ‘queer observations’, which the functional systems can use on the level of the programme when this ‘makes sense’, for example in the economic system in the form of (sexist) advertising.141 The gender category suffers a serious loss of function, when social systems form solely based upon the principle of functional differentiation.^2 Individuals are now situated in the social environment ‘and only from moment to moment, only at the moment of their participation in a function specific communication ... included in the various social sectors’.143 This means then that from the instant that ‘no longer hierarchy, but heterarchy, no longer a vertical, but a horizontal order determines the social structure of society’, the differences of women and men ‘are sooner or later no longer needed’.144 The functional differentiation thus creates ‘effects of symmetry’, so that the determinism of the gender stereotypes is made ‘lastingly irritated and relativised’ by the function systems of modern society. Those cover the stereotypes and are orientated in a more open manner, so that they ‘promise in the long run the better adaptive capacity and are therefore more successful’.145 The attempt to integrate gender relations into systems theory produced a surprising historical teleology, because of the transfer of a question which can only be clarified empirically into a temporal-diagnostic historical dimen- sion;146 ‘in the long run’, countered Keynes ironically, ‘we all are dead’. This teleology is produced by a short circuit, in which, based on the logic of the socially constructed and contingent nature of a hierarchical relationship, its disappearance is deduced as not only possible but necessary. All social artefacts, the function systems included, are contingent. Why then are they considered stable by the systems theorists, whereas gender relations disappear? This stems quite clearly from Luhmann’s androcentric perspective. Indeed, he shares this perspective at this point with the Marxist theoreticians whose works were written prior to the ‘crisis of Marxism’, for there this type of argument became known as the problem of the ‘side contradiction’. Thinking in terms of side contradictions is obviously not limited to the Marxian tradition. While they had to realise that patriarchy is not derived from capitalism, but that it is merely articulated with it, systems theorists still believed in the year 2004 that it could not be elaborated based on functional differentiation either. At least the former consider this mode of description to be, by now, at best problematic and at worst downright Old European. As systems theory catches up with the gender discussion internally, it asks instead why it is possible to maintain the gender distinction stably, that is asymmetrically, under conditions where it has become dysfunctional with regards to the primary form of differentiation,^7 or if there are ‘“secret” criteria for inclusion’.^8 Here the answer remains rooted in thinking in terms of side contradictions; the loss in function takes place on the ‘macro-level’ of modern society, while the gender difference remains a ‘secondary effect’ on the level of organisation and in particular that of interaction:^9 On the level of social structures, the gender difference has lost its structuring function. It remains, however, conspicuously operative in interactions ... The pivotal point of gender inequality is to be found in the production and reproduction of those stereotyped persona.150 And with this the circle is closed. For, if gender relations are irrelevant on the social level, then their exclusion, for example in Luhmann’s legal theory, is entirely justified. Hellmann also explains Luhmann’s lack of interest in gender studies in this way: ‘If Luhmann does not accord any greater significance to the problem of gender in social theory, the reasons for this might also be based in social theory’.151 Gender is only one category besides many others, while Luh- mann’s research interest was primarily related to social theory, so that ‘a lot, which is not directly connected to it, could be disregarded’.^2 Thus he succinctly sums up the gender-specific scientific division of labour and tendency for exclusion, which Gudrun-Axeli Knapp and AngelikaWetterer aptly describe in this way:”翻译为中文","completion":"该划分产生了一个与阿尔都塞的结构主义中相似的问题，即“抽象化行动者，仿佛那里只有……仅仅是‘位置’持有的幻影”。对特定冲突的详细研究以及根据力量、派别和联盟的差异化变得过时了。然而，归根结底，这种抽象化无法一贯地维持。因为谁来编程代码？谁在全球范围内推进差异化？如何解释偶然性和变化（‘进化’）？因此，法律系统的‘功能’的正当性也仍然具有矛盾性；因此卢曼当然最初指出，他所指的要稳定的‘期望’不是指特定个体的实际意识状态，而只是通信意义的时间方面。但他的进一步解释是针对具体主体的。‘一个人’因此可以过得更好，‘一个人’必须适应，‘一个人’试图为未来做准备，等等。至少为了建立合理性，他不得不在这一点上简要放弃社会与‘人类主体’之间的严格分离。在这里，事物本身显然是在反抗作者的意图——与康德试图用非经验的方式解释摆脱了一切经验论的超验主体相似。 3.3 “巨大叙事‘系统’” 行动者的未解决问题悄然回归理论之中。因此，系统理论至少有一个基本假设显然存在：‘有系统存在’。相比于其他非系统性主题，系统自身的论述并没有重新引入，而是独特地占据了概念金字塔的顶峰。接下来的建构主义推导仅旨在展示为了能够谈论这样的系统，需要论证哪些理论要求：当操作闭环——那么系统必须提供自我再生产——那么法律操作必须互相连接。最终展示的是一种思维必要性。也就是说，系统理论的‘宏大叙事’被称为‘自创生系统’。因此，讽刺的是，正如安德烈亚斯·韦伯所指出的，‘在无主体的系统理论中，一种新的、微妙的主体逻辑思维持续存在......，即在自创生系统的绝对主义中’。这个系统应该为卢曼提供免于社会之外的最终形而上学解释的保障。自创生系统通过其构成要素自身产生和再生产其构成要素，正是为了切断与生物学、本体论或宗教前提的联系。然而，这在放弃基因谱系推导并实施该系统时得到了反驳。韦伯认为，卢曼有意忽略这个问题，因为他主要关心的是将主体排除在社会理论的发展之外。然而，人们必须假设这形成了他的隐性规范前提。在自创生转向之前，这仍然是显而易见的：他说，‘我们的存在依赖于功能分化的大型信息处理系统’。‘在它们中间并通过它们，我们必须与世界建立联系’。只有当它们保持运行时，才存在确定性，确保它们确切地保持运行是法律的角色‘及其秩序是正义的’。 有趣的是，哈贝马斯和法律系统理论家们分享了这种系统概念，正如下文将展示的那样。但是，已经可以在这一点上用哈贝马斯对图布纳的批评来展示，他认为理论本身的这一概念是不一致的，因为所有系统在图布纳那里使用的共同的，即宏观社会通信，只是客观上相同，而且明确不是从两个系统之一的视角来看的。根据系统理论的前提，没有哪个观察者的位置可以识别一个通信事件为相同。图布纳的建议因此与将法律概念化为自创生系统的概念相矛盾；在仔细检查后，他更多地表明了交流行动理论的必要性，‘该理论将绑定在普通语言媒介中的“生活世界”与通过特殊代码驾驭但对环境具有适应性开放的“系统”区分开来’。 哈贝马斯因此认为，他‘抓住’了图布纳在不经意间已经承认通用语言的必要性指向了一个媒介，这个媒介不完全是系统性的，但包含了这些系统。但这种推理反过来又只对哈贝马斯是必要的，因为他以非常相似的方式（即使对他来说它们是对环境开放的）构想了通过特殊代码区分开的功能系统——也就是说，以这样一种方式，使得其中的行动也停止了。任何交流实践的可能性因此必须转移到‘生活世界’及其口语中（见下文进一步细节）。 两种理论都赋予系统一个有问题的主体性格。因为这样，社会条件的物化在操作层面上相当合理地得到了解释。随后，然而，这些社会条件及其行动者，二者之间的关系被抽象化。因为最终只是‘观察’到人类行动的产物，但不再是实践本身；同样，描述方式也被物化，系统行动。这样就创造了系统完全遥远和不可渗透的印象。 3.4 “奇异观察” - 没有性别的社会\' 由于理论将主观实践从社会中抹去，它无法将性别化作为一个构造社会的过程来理解。因此，毫不奇怪，在法律系统理论的重要著作中，性别关系被忽略了。根据乌尔里克·图布纳的观点，系统理论与性别研究之间的关系是相互排斥的。性别研究中数量适中的更多近期方法表明，它被视为一个可能的讨论主题，甚至与当前的话语理论或互动主义女性主义理论方法相对平行——这使得在法律系统理论中对其的忽视显得尤为突出。但这个盲点并非偶然；它反而具有‘系统性’。在1988年的一篇论文中，卢曼对‘女性研究’进行了直接的、针对性别关系的讽刺教训：只有前现代社会，尤其是等级分明的社会，根据诸如年龄、社会阶层或确实性别等差异来定位其特征，而这些区别在转向功能子系统后不再具有任何‘功能意义’：现代社会呈现了一个完全不同的形象，正因为如此，只要它对功能系统没有具体的相关性，即允许家庭的创建，男女之间的区别现在仅适合于激发社会运动。卢曼并不否认这些差异的实证效力，但那些现在只是‘奇异观察’，功能系统如果这‘有意义’，就可以在程序层面上使用，例如在经济系统中以（性别歧视的）广告形式。性别类别在以功能区分原则单独形成的社会系统中遭受了严重的功能性损失。个体现在位于社会环境中‘仅在他们参与特定功能通信的瞬间，仅在那一刻......被纳入各个社会部门’。这意味着从‘不再是等级制，而是异质制，不再是垂直的，而是水平的秩序决定社会结构’的那一刻起，女性和男性的差异‘迟早不再需要’。功能区分因此创造了‘对称效应’，使得性别刻板印象的决定论被现代社会的功能系统‘持久激怒并相对化’。这些覆盖了刻板印象并以更开放的方式定向，因此它们‘从长远来看承诺更好的适应能力，因此更成功’。试图将性别关系纳入系统理论产生了一个令人惊讶的历史远景，因为将一个只能通过实证来澄清的问题转移到了时间诊断的历史维度；‘从长远来看’，凯恩斯讽刺地反驳说，‘我们都死了’。这种远景是由一个短路产生的，在这个短路中，基于社会构建的层次关系的逻辑和偶然性，其消失不仅被推断为可能，而且被认为是必要的。所有社会制品，包括功能系统，都是偶然的。那么，为什么系统理论家认为它们是稳定的，而性别关系却消失了呢？这显然源自卢曼的以男性为中心的视角。实际上，他在这一点上与那些在‘马克思主义危机’之前撰写作品的马克思主义理论家分享了这一视角，因为在那里，这种论证类型被称为‘旁边矛盾’的问题。以旁边矛盾思考显然不仅限于马克思主义传统。虽然他们必须意识到，父权制不是源自资本主义，而只是与之结合，在2004年，系统理论家仍然相信它也不可能基于功能区分来展开。至少前者现在认为这种描述方式，到目前为止，充其量是有问题的，最糟糕的是彻头彻尾的旧欧洲式的。随着系统理论在内部赶上性别讨论，它反而询问为什么在它对主要区分形式变得功能失调的条件下，可以稳定地维持性别区分，即不对称地，或者是否有‘“秘密”标准用于包含’。这里的答案仍然植根于以旁边矛盾为思考；功能性损失发生在现代社会的‘宏观层面’，而性别差异仍然是组织层面上和特别是互动层面上的‘次要效应’：在社会结构层面，性别差异失去了其结构化功能。然而，它在互动中仍然显著地起作用......性别不平等的关键点在于那些刻板印象人物的生产和再生产中。这样，循环就闭合了。因为，如果性别关系在社会层面上是无关紧要的，那么例如在卢曼的法律理论中它们的排除就完全是正当的。Hellmann也以这种方式解释卢曼对性别研究不感兴趣的原因：‘如果卢曼没有在社会理论中赋予性别问题更大的重要性，原因也可能基于社会理论’。性别只是众多类别中的一个，而卢曼的研究兴趣主要与社会理论相关，因此‘许多与之没有直接联系的事物可以被忽略’。因此他简洁地总结了性别特定的科学劳动分工和排除倾向，古德伦-阿克赛利·克纳普和安吉丽卡·韦特雷 aptly这样描述："},{"prompt":"请将“The science of society deals with the major contexts and principal contra-dictions, it is a matter for specialists of the general; gender questions are subordinate problems, a subject of particular research interests, specialist passions of a self-referential nagging minority.153 There is no ‘management of the paradox’ of side contradictions. If systems theory wants to theoretically open up to gender relations, it has to arrive at a recognition that Marxist theory also had to open up to, that is, that a monotheist concept of society has become untenable. Societies do not come together primarily through one single structuring principle, be it the exchange of commodities or functional differentiation. The multifaceted character of the social cannot be united by one fundamental principle that shapes an era. ‘There so no sutured space peculiar to “society”, since the social itself has no essence’.154 Functional differentiation can illustrate one structuring principle of socialisation, one that is, however, articulated with others, which are also not ‘in the last instance’ determined by it in such a way that they necessarily have to lose their independence or distinctive developmental logic. Historical analysis has shown that, in the transition to modernity, gender dif-ference was not only made unambiguous (in distinction to one-sex-models, for example), but practically naturalised.155 In this regard the hierarchical gender binary is neither simply a given as part of traditional gender semantics, nor the product of premodern societies.156 The hierarchical differentiations according to the categories gender, race, nation and sexuality thus have to be analysed independently as structuring categories of socialisation, and only afterwards is it necessary to examine to what extent they are ‘irritated’ by the function systems. This also brings into view the fact that ‘highly complex’ capitalist societies encompass alongside heterarchical structuring also equally important hierarchical structuring principles, or, in other words, that functionally differentiated sectors can themselves be stratified.157 For legal systems theory, this has an important consequence: law can no longer be exclusively traced back to functional differentiation and defined in a gender-neutral manner. The assumption that the totality of society has to be conceptualised in a more pluralist way, can, however, run as a major thread through the entire work. How law relates to the totality of society can be understood as the fundamental problem of the different approaches, which is most visible in its blocking out of gender relations. 3.5 Subversion in the System There is an entirely obvious and conscious gap in Luhmann’s legal theory: the strategy of abstraction does not block out just anything; it specifically excludes moments of social power and powerlessness, as though theories of power suffered on principle from an Old European lack of complexity. With them, exactly that part of social reality which deals with the rule of men over men, disappears.^8 Luhmann’s systems theory ultimately blocks out capitalist socialisation, and racist, post-colonial and sexist conditions, under the term of the complex society. What appears at all times and anywhere in the world as resistant, inevitably has to be excluded by abstraction on the highest level. But the irony of theoretical historical blind spots resides in the fact that that which they exclude becomes all the more provocatively noticeable; as the ‘thundering of hegemony’.159 Luhmann attempts to rid himself of the political by relegating it to the institutionalised political system and denying it legitimacy everywhere else - even Teubner’s models of self-regulation are too much for him. His concept of paradox, however, involuntarily summons up a politicisation of systems theory. Even well-intentioned interpretations reach the conclusion that Luhmann ‘takes fright only at the radical nature of the results of his analysis of the paradox’?60 Urs Stäheli in particular has demonstrated, with a reading of systems theory based on Laclau’s discourse analysis, that all systems function as metaphors of the political, because they are founded on an insurmountable indeterminacy.161 The political becomes apparent in such moments of a system’s history - moments in which it is confronted with the undecidable situations of a paradox. Situations of undecidability are, as Teubner also notes, not logical contradictions, but antagonistic situations. These are undecidable because there is no ‘pre-constituted societal signifier for what is law?62 because it actually has to be permanently created anew in social struggles for hegemony.163 In the situation of undecidability decisions have to be made based on power. They show the contingency of the code: ‘The foundation of the code is its success and thus the inextinguishable violence of its instituting’.^4 The technology of de-paradoxification is ultimately the precarious attempt to normalise the daily social appropriateness of legal operations.165 Undecidability and indeterminacy have to be turned into certainty for the durability of the systemic connection and cannot do without regulating institutions, which Stäheli following Derrida calls ‘police’ or ‘policing functions’.^ The central problem of every system is the construction of its impossible identity, which becomes pre- carious as soon as undecidabilities reveal the contingency of its previously hegemonic regime.167 ‘Cannot law also be unlawful? The sole protection against such inconvenient doubt is the degree of residual conviction ... The question posed to law as to what is law, is then substituted for by the question of what is plausible within social relationships’.^8 The penalisation of ‘software pirating’ for example would - if one follows Luhmann’s depoliticised version - only be deemed necessary because the lack of normative regulation makes the future of expectations more uncertain. Conversely this means that the future could also be made more certain by permitting it, because then it would also be known what can legitimately be expected. This points to an indeterminacy, which is, however, always fiercely contested and politically decided in actually existing societies. While Luhmann wants to make de-paradoxifying regulation less dramatic as a mostly rather peaceful, evolutionary process, it becomes clear at exactly this point that it always excludes possibilities in antagonistic struggles and that it is therefore genuinely antagonistic.169 Precisely the legal decision shows this: Indeterminacy ‘cannot be overcome by means of a decisionist exercise of power. This impossible distinction marks law to this day: legal decisions embody delay in the giving of the law. Law cannot be identified from the text alone, hence it must be discussed and argued over. However, since the speaking of the law only seldom leads to consensus within non-coercive discourses, a decision must be taken. Yet, because a decision could be decided differently, justification is required. And because even this is not enough, an act of legal implementation is needed. However, postponement is equally not ended by implementation, because there are never any final grounds, only penultimate grounds’.™ Ultimately paradoxes are no threat for Luhmann, because they are only produced by the self-observation of a system, leaving the system’s reproduction unaffected. However, Teubner’s detailed explanation of autopoiesis has just demonstrated that one can only speak of the phase of ‘autopoietic law’ when the system components of the legal system are connected with each other in a hyper-cyclical manner. Here the self-observation/self-description in dogmatics and theory is very much a vital prerequisite. The momentarily successful autopoiesis therefore rather creates a ‘deceptively stable base’. For, if the self-description is constitutive for the systems, then it always already influences the system’s reproduction: ‘That the paradox occurs means that the system tempor-arily loses its sense of connectivity, or that it is reminded that its fragile modes of reducing complexity can break down’.171 Within the legal system lurks thus the subversion of the system, and this means the political, understood ‘as a practice of creation, reproduction and transformation of social relations’.^2 CHAPTER 3 Social Self-organisation: Habermas 1 Money, Power, Solidarity Habermas, with his radically democratic premise, that the ‘system of rights’ could be the medium of self-organisation of an artificial legal community,1 represents Luhmann’s antipode. He adheres, in the tradition of critical theory, to the possibility of a rationally arranged world which has institutionalised ‘the set of necessary conditions for emancipated forms of life about which the participants themselves must first reach an understanding’. In the preface of his main work in legal theory, Between Facts and Norms, he notes that precisely this democratic self-organisation forms the normative core of the socialist project.2 Against this background Luhmann’s theory has to appear particularly problematic to him, as it does not allow us to conceive of the production of a discursively created rational consensus.3 Furthermore Habermas criticises all those theories which underestimate the normative presuppositions of legal practices due to a false realism, and which misjudge their normative obstinacy with a certain legal scepticism.4 This verdict includes Marxist approaches no less than Derrida’s deconstructivist reading of law.5 Habermas’ critique is all the more pitiless, because he locates precisely in the legal structures a surviving possibility for ‘social solidarity... in need of continual regeneration’ in ‘highly complex’ societies.6 Why then does Habermas ascribe this potential to law?”翻译为中文","completion":"“社会科学处理主要语境和主要矛盾，它是一般性专家的事务；性别问题是次要问题，属于特定研究兴趣、专家激情和自我指涉性唠叨少数人的主题。并不存在对旁边矛盾的‘悖论管理’。如果系统理论想要理论上对性别关系开放，它必须达到一个认识，即马克思理论也不得不开放的认识，也就是说，单一神论社会观念已变得站不住脚。社会主要通过单一的结构原则聚合在一起，无论是商品交换还是功能分化。社会的多面性不能被一个构成时代的基本原则所统一。‘社会’没有一个特有的缝合空间，因为社会本身没有本质。功能分化可以描绘出一个社会化的结构原则，这个原则虽然与其他原则一起被表述，但也不是‘最终’被它决定，以至于它们必须失去它们的独立性或独特的发展逻辑。 历史分析显示，在向现代性过渡的过程中，性别差异不仅被去模糊化（与一性模型为例），而且实际上被自然化。在这方面，等级性别二元论既不仅仅作为传统性别语义的一部分而是一个既定事实，也不是前现代社会的产物。因此，性别、种族、国家和性取向等类别的等级差异化必须作为社会化的结构类别独立分析，之后才需要检验它们在多大程度上被功能系统‘激怒’。这也让人们看到了，‘高度复杂’的资本主义社会在异质结构化的同时，也包含同等重要的等级结构化原则，换句话说，功能分化的部门本身可以是分层的。对于法律系统理论，这有一个重要的后果：法律不能再仅仅追溯到功能分化并以性别中立的方式定义。社会整体必须以更加多元化的方式概念化的假设，然而，可以贯穿整个工作。法律如何与社会整体关联可以被理解为不同方法的基本问题，这在其排除性别关系时最为明显。 3.5 系统中的颠覆 在卢曼的法律理论中存在一个完全明显且有意识的缺口：抽象策略不仅仅排除了一些东西；它特别排除了社会力量和无力的时刻，仿佛权力理论原则上就患有欧洲旧式的复杂性不足。随着它们的消失，恰恰是那部分涉及男性对男性的统治的社会现实。卢曼的系统理论最终排除了资本主义社会化、种族主义、后殖民和性别歧视的条件，在复杂社会的术语下。在世界上任何时候和任何地方看似顽抗的东西，都不可避免地必须通过最高层面的抽象排除。 但理论历史盲点的讽刺在于，它们排除的东西变得更加挑衅性地引人注目；就像‘霸权的轰鸣’。卢曼试图通过将政治贬低到制度化的政治系统中并否认其在其他地方的合法性来摆脱政治——甚至Teubner的自我调节模型对他来说也过于过分。然而，他的悖论概念无意中唤起了系统理论的政治化。即使是出于好意的解读也得出结论，卢曼‘仅仅对他对悖论分析结果的激进性感到惊恐’？乌尔斯·斯泰利尤其通过基于拉克劳的话语分析的系统理论阅读，证明了所有系统都作为政治的隐喻，因为它们建立在一个不可逾越的不确定性之上。 这种不确定性在系统历史的这些时刻变得明显——在它面对悖论的不可决定情形时。正如Teubner也指出的，不可决定情形不是逻辑矛盾，而是对抗性情形。它们之所以不可决定，是因为没有‘预设的社会标志来定义什么是法律？因为它实际上必须在社会霸权斗争中不断重新创造。在不可决定的情况下，必须基于权力做出决定。它们展示了代码的偶然性：‘代码的基础是其成功，因此是其设立的不灭暴力’。去悖论化的技术最终是试图将法律操作的日常社会适当性正常化的危险尝试。不确定性和不明确性必须被转化为系统连接的持久性的确定性，而这不能没有调节机构，斯泰利跟随德里达称之为‘警察’或‘警察功能’。每个系统的核心问题是其不可能身份的构建，一旦不可决定性揭示了其先前霸权制度的偶然性，就变得岌岌可危。‘法律也可能是非法的吗？对这种不便怀疑的唯一保护是剩余信念的程度......法律作为什么被提出的问题，然后被社会关系中什么是可信的问题所取代’。例如，‘软件盗版’的刑罚化——如果按照卢曼去政治化的版本——只是因为缺乏规范性规定使得预期的未来更加不确定。相反，这意味着未来也可以通过允许它变得更加确定，因为那样也就知道可以合法期待什么。这指向了一种不确定性，然而，在实际存在的社会中，这种不确定性总是激烈争议的并且在政治上决定。 虽然卢曼希望使去悖论化的调节看起来不那么戏剧化，作为一个大多数相当和平的、演化的过程，但恰恰在这一点上，它变得清晰，它总是在对抗性斗争中排除可能性，因此它本质上是真正的对抗性的。正是法律决定显示了这一点：不确定性‘不能通过决定性的权力行使来克服。这个不可能的区分标志着今日的法律：法律决定体现了法律颁布中的延迟。法律不能仅从文本中识别，因此必须讨论和争辩。然而，由于法律的发言在非强制性话语中很少达成共识，因此必须做出决定。然而，因为决定可以有所不同，所以需要理由。而且因为这还不够，需要一个法律实施的行为。然而，实施同样没有结束推迟，因为永远没有最终理由，只有倒数第二理由’。 最终，悖论对卢曼来说不是威胁，因为它们仅由系统的自我观察产生，不影响系统的再生产。然而，Teubner对自创生的详细解释刚刚证明，只有当法律系统的系统组件以一种超循环方式相互连接时，才能谈论‘自创生法律’的阶段。在这里自我观察/自我描述在教条和理论上是非常重要的前提。因此，瞬时成功的自创生反而创造了一个‘虚假稳定的基础’。因为，如果自我描述对系统构成性，那么它总是已经影响系统的再生产：‘悖论的出现意味着系统暂时失去了其连通性的感觉，或者提醒它其简化复杂性的脆弱模式可能崩溃’。在法律系统内部潜伏着系统的颠覆，这意味着政治，理解为‘创造、再生产和转变社会关系的实践’。 第3章 社会自组织：哈贝马斯 1 钱、权力、团结 哈贝马斯持有根本民主前提，即‘权利体系’可以成为人造法律共同体自组织的媒介，代表了卢曼的对立面。他坚持认为，在批判理论的传统中，有可能建立一个理性安排的世界，这个世界制度化了‘解放生活形式的一套必要条件，关于这些条件参与者自己首先必须达成理解’。在他法律理论的主要作品《事实与规范之间》的序言中，他指出，正是这种民主自组织构成了社会主义项目的规范核心。在这一背景下，卢曼的理论对他来说显得特别有问题，因为它不允许我们构想出一个通过话语产生的理性共识的生产。此外，哈贝马斯批评所有那些由于错误的现实主义而低估法律实践规范前提的理论，并以某种法律怀疑论错误地评价它们的规范固执。这项判决既包括马克思主义方法也包括德里达的解构主义阅读法律。哈贝马斯的批评尤为无情，因为他正是在法律结构中定位了‘社会团结……需要持续再生’在‘高度复杂’的社会中的生存可能性。那么，为什么哈贝马斯会将这种潜力归于法律呢？”"},{"prompt":"请将“1.1 Communicative Reason Habermas already achieved a dialectical perspective in his preliminary studies for The Theory of Communicative Action, which he now uses for the analysis of law; with the aim of preserving the practical reason [praktische Vernunft] of the philosophy of the subject, he displaces it into the medium of language.7 In this way he can overcome two central failures of previous concepts of rationality. On the one hand he leaves the horizon of individualistic notions of morality by making language the medium of socialisation.8 On the other hand, he situates rationality and ideas/ideals in the linguistic telos of understanding itself. Whoever uses language in order to communicate about something in the world also has to engage with pragmatic preconditions of a counterfac- tual kind: ‘In seeking to reach an understanding, natural-language users must assume, among other things, that the participants pursue their elocutionary goals without reservations, that they tie their agreement to the intersubjective recognition of criticisable validity claims, and that they are ready to take on the obligations resulting from consensus and relevant for further interaction’.9 Thus necessary idealisations are undertaken. On a first level, communicatively acting individuals have to ascribe identical meanings to expressions, even if they are not aware of this. On a second level, the interacting participants must consider themselves mutually accountable, and presuppose that they can orient their actions according to validity claims, which can in the case of critique be backed up with the right kinds of justifications.10 Ideas or counterfactual presuppositions are thus de-transcendentalised and situated at ‘the heart of ordinary, everyday communicative practice’, in other words, ‘brought down from the transcendental heaven to the earth of the lifeworld’.n Thus, Habermas overcomes the opposition of idea and perceptible reality with a strategy that is very similar to Althusser’s. While Althusser had refused to see ideology as a mere reflex of an economic base, and rather found it materialised in social practice and apparatuses themselves (Chapter 7), Habermas conceived of the idea itself as embodied in language^2 and therefore likewise as being materialised in practice. Normativity is thus not a construct that floats above the ‘real world’ but a ‘counterfactual basis of an actual practice of reaching understanding’?3 Beyond this commonality Althusser and Habermas differ, of course, in that Althusser speaks of ‘ideology’ and Habermas of ‘reason’. Against this background, however, Habermas criticises political and legal theory, which are disintegrating into camps that are torn between facticity and validity. While the former lose touch with social reality, the latter screen out all normative aspects?4 An analysis of social structures always also demands - so Habermas concludes - the analysis of normative practice, precisely as a part of those structures. Social interaction is achieved by coordinating the action plans of different actors without the exercise of manifest violence, such that one party’s actions ‘link up’ with those of others. Only in this way can social order even come about, that is to say when language is not only seen as a means to transmit information, but when at the same time the elocutionary forces of speech acts are recognised. It then becomes apparent that they themselves are the primary source of social integration.15 No different are the demands made of a legal theory; it has to assume that the underlying tension between ‘facticity and validity’ constitutes the basic structure of modern law?6 Those two moments converge particularly in legal validity, that is, the facticity of the state’s law enforcement with the legitimising force of a process for creating legislation that claims to be rational.17 The analysis of law has to combine external access to law with a reconstruction from an internal perspective^8 that is, an analysis of its socially structuring function with its own claim to be legitimate law. Habermas assumes with Weber that social orders can only be maintained in the long run as legitimate orders0’ and couples this with Durkheim’s insight that the social cohesion produced by norms depends upon democratic will. To those two insights he adds the analysis of the special role communication and language play in this process.20 Habermas therefore reaches the conclusion that the law’s perform-ance of socio-structural integration depends on its performance of normative legitimation, namely on its origin in procedures which assert institutionally the potential of communicative reason as it is embedded in discursive practice. Habermas succeeds in developing his ideal of communicative reason - the ideal by which he measures existing society - as something already implicit in Adorno and Horkheimer, although he certainly does not share their critical assessment of instrumental reason. Adorno had understood reconciliation in terms of an intact intersubjectivity, which is only brought about in the reciprocity of communication based on free acknowledgement. Thus he himself had developed an ‘implicit communicative concept of freedom’.2i Habermas is aware that this is most of all a critical assessment and that there exists also, and perhaps predominately, strategic action. Communicative action has a potential which does not necessarily prevail: Not all eluctionary acts are constitutive for communicative action, but only those with which speakers connect criticisable validity claims. In the other cases, when a speaker is pursuing undeclared ends with per- locutionary acts - ends on which the hearer can take no position at all - as in relation to imperatives - the potential for the binding (or bonding) force of good reasons - a potential which is always contained in linguistic communication - remains unexploited.22 In a very central position Habermas thus, following the linguistic turn [English in original], switches to communication, exactly like Luhmann. But - and this is a crucial difference - this is about communicative action, and not systemic processes. Habermas wants to take account of the assumptions ‘that the human species maintains itself through the socially coordinated activities of its members and that this coordination has to be established through communication - and in certain central spheres through communication aimed at reaching agreement’?3 Therefore practice, even if it is primarily communicative, is of great importance in his theory; society requires the coordination of actions - and this coordination happens through language. Language contains a rationality potential - and it is the language of specific speakers, so that it is not possible to abstract from them. Modernity thus provides for Habermas, contrary to the understanding of older critical theory, starting points for locating rationality in social practice. They are, however, due to problems modernity creates out of itself, blocked and cannot be exploited?4 1.2 Integration While for Luhmann the systems rather have the status of a foundational premise, in Habermas one could ascribe this status to the concept of social integration. Both theorists are fundamentally engaged with the question of how the reproduction of the social whole is possible. Interestingly, both theories address law against this background, a premise which a materialist legal theory also has to examine. As Habermas foregrounds the engaged ‘actors’, he answers the question in a consistent manner from a perspective that is focused on the reproduction of the species. 1.2.1 Dual Socialization Habermas rejects the idea that society - understood as a holistic whole - is a totality in the Hegelian sense.25 Instead he conceives three subsystems, two systems proper and the ‘lifeworld’, from which one has to define the existence of the social whole. He follows the idea that was prepared by Adam Smith, spelled out by Marx in terms of social theory and finally sociologically developed by Talcott Parsons, that modern capitalist societies develop institutional complexes, which become independent of their producers and can as such no longerbe immediately understood by them. In Parson’s terminology, Habermas conceptualises systems which form in the course of social ‘evolution’. Unlike Luhmann, however, he retains a narrow systems-concept26 which only knows two systems, which both process material reproduction: economy and state. In his efforts to relate the diverging conceptual strategies of action and systems theory and integrate them with each other/7 he connects the insights of systems theory with Husserl’s concept of the lifeworld and Mead’s theory of interaction. In consequence, the basis of the systems still remains the lifeworld, that is the horizon of communicative action, consisting in ‘individual skills as well - the intuitive knowledge of how one deals with situations - and socially customary practices too - the intuitive knowledge of what one can count on in situations - no less than background convictions known in a trivial sense’/8 In the course of their evolution the lifeworld and systems have thus differ-entiated, as material reproduction, including political regulation, has become increasingly complex, while the rationality of the lifeworld increased, that is, the secularisation and ever more comprehensive questioning of convictions which had been believed to be certain. The crucial difference between the two systems and the lifeworld is that the former operate by means of non-linguistic communication media and control a social intercourse that is largely disconnected from norms and values. The rational potential [Vernunftpotential] no longer resides in those reified life contexts/9 which rather coagulate to Hegel’s ‘second nature’ and elude the prior knowledge of communicative everyday practice. They are, precisely as in Marx and Adorno, only ‘accessible only to the counterintuitive knowledge of the social sciences developing since the eighteenth century’.30 1.2.2 Lifeworld For Habermas the lifeworld as well as the systems - and also law, as will be demonstrated later on - have the function of lowering the ever-present risk of dissensus. His theory of communicative action quite obviously generates a fundamental problem; the mechanism of mutual understanding, on which the entire weight of the theory lies, produces a growing pressure for rationality, in which ‘the zones of what is unproblematic shrink’31 Therefore the risk of dissensus grows. The lifeworld heads off this risk by embedding communicative action in lifeworld contexts, which ‘provide the backing of a massive background consensus’32 This is ‘a sprawling, deeply set, and unshakable rock of background assumptions, loyalties, and skills’.33 The lifeworld reproduces itself through three processes; cultural reproduction, that is, the continuity of tradition; social integration through legitimately regulated interpersonal relations and the identity of groups; and the socialisation of the members of the lifeworld, which secures for them generalised competences for action.”翻译为中文","completion":"1.1 沟通理性 哈贝马斯在《沟通行动理论》的前期研究中已经取得了辩证的视角，他现在用它来分析法律；为了保留主体哲学的实践理性，他将其转移到语言媒介中。通过这种方式，他克服了以前理性概念的两个核心失败。一方面，他通过将语言作为社会化的媒介，超越了个人主义道德观念的视域。另一方面，他将理性和理想/观念定位于理解自身的语言目标中。任何使用语言沟通世界中事物的人，也必须参与到一种反事实的实用前提中：“在寻求理解的过程中，自然语言使用者必须假设，参与者无保留地追求其言语目标，他们将同意绑定于对可批判的有效性主张的互相认同，并且他们准备承担由共识产生并且对进一步互动相关的义务。”因此，进行了必要的理想化。在第一层面上，沟通行动的个体必须将相同的意义归于表达，即使他们并不意识到这一点。在第二层面上，互动的参与者必须相互认为彼此有责任，并假设他们可以根据有效性主张指导自己的行动，在批评的情况下，可以用正确的方式进行支持。因此，理想或反事实前提被去超验化，并定位于“日常沟通实践的核心”，换句话说，“从超验的天空带到了生活世界的大地”。 哈贝马斯用一种非常类似于阿尔都塞的策略克服了理想与可感知现实的对立。虽然阿尔都塞拒绝将意识形态视为经济基础的简单反映，而是发现它在社会实践和体系本身中具体化（第7章），哈贝马斯则将理念本身理解为体现在语言中，因此同样在实践中具体化。因此，规范性不是悬浮在“现实世界”之上的构造，而是“实际达成理解实践的反事实基础”。除了这一共性，阿尔都塞和哈贝马斯当然有所不同，阿尔都塞谈的是“意识形态”，哈贝马斯谈的是“理性”。 然而，在这一背景下，哈贝马斯批评了政治和法律理论，这些理论分裂成陷入事实性和有效性之间撕裂的阵营。前者失去了与社会现实的联系，后者则屏蔽了所有规范性方面。哈贝马斯总结说，社会结构的分析总是也要求——作为结构的一部分——对规范性实践的分析。社会互动通过协调不同行动者的行动计划而实现，而无需显性暴力，使得一方的行动与另一方的行动“连接”起来。只有这样，社会秩序才能产生，即当语言不仅被视为传递信息的手段，同时言语行为的言说力量也被认可时。这时就显而易见，它们本身是社会整合的主要来源。 法律理论的要求也不例外；它必须假设“事实性和有效性”之间的潜在张力构成了现代法律的基本结构。这两个时刻特别在法律效力中汇聚，即国家的法律执行事实性与声称为理性的立法创造过程的合法化力量。法律分析必须将对法律的外部访问与从内部视角的重构相结合，即对其社会结构功能的分析与其自身合法法律的要求相结合。哈贝马斯假定，根据韦伯，社会秩序只能作为合法秩序长期维持，并将这一点与涂尔干关于规范产生的民主意志依赖的社会凝聚的见解相结合。他在这两点见解中加入了沟通和语言在此过程中所扮演的特殊角色的分析。哈贝马斯因此得出结论，法律实现社会结构整合的表现取决于其实现规范合法化的表现，即其起源于在话语实践中体现沟通理性潜力的程序的机构断言。 哈贝马斯成功地发展了他的沟通理性理想——他用它来衡量现存社会——这一理想在阿多诺和霍克海默身上已经隐含存在，尽管他当然不分享他们对工具理性的批判评价。阿多诺将和解理解为一种完整的互主体性，这种互主体性仅在基于自由承认的沟通中产生。因此，他自己发展了一个“隐含的沟通自由概念”。 哈贝马斯意识到，这首先是一个批判性评价，并且还存在，也许主要是，战略性行动。沟通行动有一个不一定占优的潜力：并非所有言说行为都是沟通行动的构成要素，只有那些与之相关的发言者提出可批判有效性主张的行为才是。在其他情况下，当一个发言者通过言外之意的行为追求未声明的目的——在听者根本无法对其立场的情况下——就像是对命令的关系——言语沟通中始终包含的好理由的约束（或结合）力的潜力——保持未被利用。 因此，哈贝马斯在非常核心的位置上，遵循语言转向，正如卢曼那样转向沟通。但是——这是一个关键的区别——这是关于沟通行动，而不是系统过程。哈贝马斯想要考虑到假设，“人类通过其成员的社会协调活动来维持自身，这种协调必须通过沟通来建立——在某些核心领域通过旨在达成一致的沟通来实现”。因此，即使是主要是沟通的实践，在他的理论中也具有重要意义；社会需要行动的协调——而这种协调通过语言发生。语言包含一个理性潜力——它是特定发言者的语言，因此不可能从他们那里抽象出来。 因此，与旧批判理论的理解相反，现代性为哈贝马斯提供了在社会实践中定位理性的起点。然而，它们由于现代性自身产生的问题而受阻，不能被利用。 1.2 整合 虽然对卢曼来说，系统更多的是一个基本前提的地位，在哈贝马斯这里，可以将这一地位归于社会整合的概念。这两位理论家都基本上致力于探讨社会整体的再生产如何成为可能的问题。有趣的是，这两种理论都针对这一背景讨论了法律，这是唯物主义法律理论也必须检验的前提。哈贝马斯将焦点放在积极“行动者”上，他以一种专注于物种再生产的视角一贯地回答了这个问题。 1.2.1 双重社会化 哈贝马斯拒绝了将社会——理解为一个整体——作为黑格尔意义上的整体的想法。相反，他构想了三个子系统，两个适当的系统和“生活世界”，从中必须定义社会整体的存在。他遵循亚当·斯密的想法，通过马克思的社会理论具体化，并最终由塔尔科特·帕森斯在社会学上发展的观点，即现代资本主义社会发展出的机构复合体，变得独立于它们的生产者，并因此不再能被它们立即理解。用帕森斯的术语，哈贝马斯构想了在社会“进化”过程中形成的系统。然而，与卢曼不同，他保留了一个狭窄的系统概念，只知道两个处理物质再生产的系统：经济和国家。 在他努力关联行动和系统理论的不同概念策略并将它们相互整合的过程中，他将系统理论的见解与胡塞尔的生活世界概念和米德的互动理论联系起来。因此，系统的基础仍然是生活世界，即沟通行动的视野，包括“个体技能——如何处理情境的直观知识——以及社会习惯性实践——在情境中可以依靠什么的直观知识——不仅如此，还有以琐碎的意义所知的背景信念”。 在它们的进化过程中，生活世界和系统因此区别开来，因为物质再生产，包括政治调控，变得越来越复杂，而生活世界的理性增加，即对曾被认为是确定无疑的信念进行世俗化和更全面的质疑。两个系统和生活世界之间的关键区别在于，前者通过非语言沟通媒介运作，并控制在很大程度上脱离规范和价值的社会交往。理性潜力不再存在于那些具体化的生活情境中，这些情境反而凝结成黑格尔的“第二性质”，并逃避沟通日常实践的先验知识。它们，正如马克思和阿多诺所言，“仅对自18世纪以来发展的反直观的社会科学知识可及”。 1.2.2 生活世界 对于哈贝马斯来说，生活世界以及系统——以及稍后将展示的法律——都有降低普遍存在的分歧风险的功能。他的沟通行动理论显然产生了一个根本问题；理论重心所在的相互理解机制，产生了越来越大的理性压力，以至于“无问题区域缩小”，因此分歧风险增加。生活世界通过将沟通行动嵌入生活世界情境来化解这一风险，这些情境“提供了大量的背景共识支持”。这是“一个庞大的、根深蒂固的、不可动摇的背景假设、忠诚和技能的基石”。生活世界通过三个过程自我再生产；文化再生产，即传统的延续；通过合法调节的人际关系和群体的身份实现的社会一体化；以及生活世界成员的社会化，为他们确保了行动的一般化能力。"},{"prompt":"请将“1.2.3 Systems Imperatives of securing existence, that is the material reproduction of the lifeworld, lead with the increased complexity of modern societies to the differentiation of specialised systems. Their specificity lies in that communicative action is suspended here. Instead of through consensus, integration takes place systemically, by way of a non-normative regulation that extends beyond individual consciousness^4 so that actions are not necessarily coordinated intentionally, that is with the communicative effort of the participants, but objectively, ‘“behind the[ir] backs\'”.\'\'*5 This then is the manner in which the steering media of the two systems, power and money, can ‘hold off’ the risk of dissensus. Uncoupling the interaction from lifeworld contexts makes it possible to exert generalised, strategic influence while bypassing processes of consensus-oriented communication, so that the lifeworld context gets devalued.36 Habermas calls this development, in Marxian terminology, reification: ‘the unleashed functionalist reason of system maintenance disregards and overrides the claim to reason ingrained in communicative sociation [Vergesellschaftung] and lets the rationalization of the lifeworld run idle’.37 He interprets reification as a ‘pathological de-formation of the communicative infrastructure of the lifeworld’. Unlike in Marx, however, the development of objectified systems is not in itself an expression of reification, but this occurs only at the moment when the lifeworld does not withdraw from the affected functions, because it is not possible to ‘painlessly transfer’ those functions to the media- steered systems of action.38 The internal dynamics of the capitalist economic system can be preserved only insofar as the accumulation process is uncoupled from orientations to use value, and it ‘has to be kept as free as possible from lifeworld restrictions’. The internal systemic logic of capitalism has to be met, even at the cost of technisising the lifeworld. However, this is only a practical, not a theoretical postulate^9 Habermas thus sees independent development of social conditions much more positively than older critical theory does. One could even say that this is exactly the fork in the road where Habermas leaves the Marxian tradition. He hopes to put the rationally ordered world into practice despite and with the help of those independent developments. For the systemic connections are also a higher and evolutionary advantageous level of integration, a higher level of system differentiation, which opens up new steering possibilities that unburden the actors, and can connect highly complex, global societies and provide them with economic growth.40 Exactly at this point a turn towards the assumption of systems theory takes place, which considers systems differentiation evolutionary progress. This causes enormous relief: The function systems can ignore alien factors and concentrate on the efficient and effective execution of systems imperatives. In the sphere of the lifeworld, discussions, which are as ever conflictual, about economic allocation and the political self-exposure of society can be discussed freed from the immediate technical tasks, which are now taken care of by sub-systems.41 The results are in turn - and here we get to the central importance of law in this analysis - translated by law into the rationality of the subsystems, as will be outlined below. According to Habermas’s concept of society ‘[T]he social-life context repro-duces itself both through the media-controlled purposive-rational actions of its members and through the common will anchored in the communicative practice of all individuals’42 Thus the three forces of macro-social integration are: money, administrative power, and solidarity43 2 The System of Rights Against this background Habermas considers law from a ‘dual perspective’: internally, by reconstructing its normative content, and externally as a component of social reality.44 2.1 The External Perspective: The Socially Structured Location of Law For the social location of law in Habermas one has to note first that it is not introduced as a legal system as it is in Luhmann. Rather, it remains a mechanism of the lifeworld, through which the two systems of the lifeworld are ‘anchored’, that is, institutionalised through private and public law. The reason why Habermas attributes law to the lifeworld is that its potential to bestow legitimacy [Legitimationspotential] comes in modernity to bear the main brunt of social integration, which the lifeworld provides in contrast to systemic integration45 Again, the problem of dissension is the trigger for this ‘functional’ necessity of law. For the background consensus of the lifeworld is in complex societies no longer sufficient for successful social integration46 The fundamental structure of facticity and validity is noticeable in that, through law, norms created through consensus-based procedures acquire legitimacy, and their results can be coupled with the potential for sanctions. Thus strategic interactions can be resolved with norms the actors themselves agree on. When action is both strategic and communicative, norms have to take on the paradoxical nature of establishing on the one hand de facto restrictions, while on the other hand still developing socially integrating force. They have to simultaneously bring about de facto constraint and willingness to comply by means of legitimate validity. The Kantian definition of law, according to which ‘the choice of one can be united with the choice of another in accordance with a universal law of free- dom’,47 is translated into a theory of integration by way of a procedural turn; counterfactual norms, which have been developed in legitimacy-generating procedures, have a socially structuring effect - this is, yet again, the payoff of Habermas’s reflections. Destabilisation resulting from rationally motivated dissent is avoided, because the addressees cannot question the validity of the norms they follow. Through the process of law-making ‘the permanent risk of contradiction is maintained in ongoing discourses’ and ‘transformed into the productive force of a presumptively rational political opinion- and will formation’48 In particular, the paradoxically heightened tension between subjective freedoms and coercion requires that the demands for rationality in the process of lawmaking are accordingly high49 The normative self-understanding of law is, however, like all lifeworld com-ponents, structurally threatened by the encroachment of systemic imperatives. It also has to process those imperatives, in which often enough ‘normatively unfiltered interest positions often carry the day only because they are stronger and use the legitimating force of legal forms to cloak their merely factual strength’. Law therefore remains ‘a profoundly ambiguous medium of societal integration’.50 One could say that Luhmann ascribes greater self-will to the legal system than the discourse-theoretical reasoning, although it is precisely a lack of normative self-will that Habermas decries in Luhmann.’4 The ambivalent character of law can also be seen in its conceptualisation as a ‘transmission belt’: because law is the institutionalising medium of systems in the lifeworld and therefore connected with all mechanisms of integration, it constitutes at the same time a sphere of mediation for Habermas. That is, through law, solidarity, which is rooted in concrete living conditions, is transmitted in abstract form to the relationships of highly complex societies, which have become anonymous,52 or, in terms of linguistic theory, the legal code brings messages from vernacular language into a form in which it remains intelligible for the special codes of the system: ‘To this extent the language of law ... can function as a transformer in the society-wide communication circulating between system and lifeworld’.53 Habermas thus attributes far greater significance to law than Luhmann. It does not remain limited to its own world, but gains a universal function, which takes on both the burden of social integration, and is also able to switch between different modes of communication. Accordingly, it is much less closed and self-referential than in the systems theory version. 2.2 The Internal Perspective: The Co-originality of Popular Sovereignty and Human Rights For the internal analysis of law, Habermas choses a particular strategy which has led to a range of misunderstandings in the literature.54 Taking into consideration the theory of democracy, he initially does not propose a normative concept, but tries to reconstruct the paradigmatic background understanding of law, that is, the moral and practical self-understanding of modernity.55 However, he proposes a new, discourse-theoretical ‘reading’ of democratic practice until the present.56 Thus the point is not to immediately present an alternative model to reality, but to interpret democracies up to now as practical realisations of a certain self-understanding of democracy. He now wants to reconstruct this conception in such a way that it can connect with his own concept of communicative reason, in order to make visible the notyet achieved potential of the democratic principle. This typically Habermasian approach, which avoids treating normativity in a vacuum and grounds it instead in social practice, quickly leads to the misunderstanding that he is only concerned with a justification of the existing.57 As Ingeborg Maus aptly notes, this approach stems, to the contrary, from a democratic intention; Habermas does not want to explain to the citizens in an expertocratic manner what they should rationally decide, but conversely has to reconstruct the rational from their constitutional practice.58 How then does this reconstruction proceed? ‘I take as my starting point the rights citizens must accord one another if they want to legitimately regulate their common life by means of positive law’.59 The socially existing legal form, consisting of subjective rights coupled with coercive force, is the ‘product of the disintegration of traditional ethical life’ and is in this regard not a normatively justifiable, but simply a really existing principle.60 Initially it is in no way related to the democratic principle: There is therefore for citizens no form of normative necessity to join together in a legal community ... The decision to use the historically present legal form in order to legitimately organise collective life with the help of positive law is rather entirely contingent. The option of refraining from a legal organization of collective life remains open to all societies. Yet, when a society decides to adopt it, ... it has to accept those qualities of law that result from the functionally complementary relationship to post-conventional morality ... This also prominently includes private autonomy, as the counterpart of coercive power/’1 Habermas now logically develops the ‘system of rights’’2 in a circular process, in which legal code and democratic principle are constituted co-originally.’3 The circular process is meant to make precisely this co-originality possible in the representation. It must not be stopped at any point such that as a result either subjective rights or the democratic principle would have priority over the other. ‘That from this perspective subjective right appears as both the “result” and “precondition” of political autonomous legislation, then does not seem to be a “contradiction”, but rather the point of the argument’.’4”翻译为中文","completion":"1.2.3 系统 确保生存的必要性，即生活世界的物质再生产，随着现代社会的复杂性增加，导致专门系统的分化。它们的特殊性在于这里暂停了沟通行动。整合不是通过共识实现的，而是通过超越个体意识的非规范性调节系统地进行的，因此行动不一定是有意地协调的，即不是通过参与者的沟通努力，而是客观地，“在他们背地里”实现的。这就是两个系统的引导媒介，权力和金钱，能够“避开”分歧风险的方式。将互动与生活世界情境解耦，使得能够在绕过以共识为导向的沟通过程的情况下施加广泛的战略影响，使得生活世界情境被贬值。哈贝马斯将这种发展称为马克思主义术语下的物化：“系统维护的释放的功能理性无视并超越了沟通社会化中根植的理性要求，并让生活世界的合理化空转”。他将物化解释为“生活世界的沟通基础设施的病态变形”。然而，与马克思不同的是，客观化系统的发展本身并不是物化的表现，只有在生活世界无法从受影响的功能中撤回时，因为无法“无痛地将”这些功能转移到媒介控制的行动系统中，物化才会发生。资本主义经济系统的内部动力只有在积累过程与对使用价值的导向脱钩时才能保持，它“必须尽可能地摆脱生活世界的限制”。必须满足资本主义的内在系统逻辑，即使是以技术化生活世界为代价。然而，这只是一个实践的，而不是理论的前提。 哈贝马斯对社会条件的独立发展的看法比旧批判理论更为积极。可以说，这正是哈贝马斯离开马克思传统的路口。尽管有这些独立发展，他希望实现合理有序的世界。因为系统连接也是一种更高和进化上有利的整合水平，一种更高的系统分化水平，它开启了新的引导可能性，减轻了行动者的负担，并能够连接高度复杂的全球社会，并为它们提供经济增长。正是在这一点上，系统理论的假设发生了转向，将系统分化视为进化进步。这带来了巨大的解脱：功能系统可以忽略外来因素，专注于系统要求的高效和有效执行。在生活世界领域，有关经济分配和社会的政治自我暴露的讨论可以在摆脱了直接技术任务的情况下进行讨论，这些任务现在由子系统处理。因此，法律的结果反过来（在这里我们得到了法律在此分析中的核心重要性）被法律翻译为子系统的合理性，如下所述。 根据哈贝马斯的社会概念，“社会生活情境通过其成员的媒介控制的目的性理性行动和通过所有个体的沟通实践中锚定的共同意愿来再生产自身”。因此，宏观社会整合的三个力量是：金钱、行政权力和团结。 2 权利体系 在这一背景下，哈贝马斯以“双重视角”考察法律：内部地，通过重建其规范内容，以及作为社会现实的一个组成部分的外部视角。 2.1 外部视角：法律的社会结构位置 在哈贝马斯的法律社会定位中，首先要注意的是，它不像在卢曼那里被引入为一个法律系统。相反，它仍然是生活世界的一种机制，通过私法和公法将生活世界的两个系统“锚定”，即制度化。哈贝马斯将法律归因于生活世界的原因是，其合法性赋予的潜力在现代承担了生活世界提供的社会整合的主要负担，这与系统整合形成对比。再次，分歧的问题是法律“功能”必需性的触发因素。因为在复杂社会中，生活世界的背景共识不再足以成功实现社会整合。通过法律，基于共识程序创造的规范获得合法性，并且它们的结果可以与制裁潜力相结合。因此，可以用行动者自己同意的规范解决战略性互动。当行动既是战略性的又是沟通性的时候，规范必须承担一种矛盾的本质，一方面建立事实上的限制，另一方面仍然发展社会整合力量。它们必须同时通过合法有效性带来事实上的约束和遵守意愿。 康德对法律的定义，即“一个人的选择可以根据自由的普遍法则与另一个人的选择相一致”，通过程序转向被翻译成一种整合理论；在合法性生成程序中发展的反事实规范具有社会结构化作用——这是哈贝马斯反思的回报。通过理性激发的异议引起的不稳定性被避免了，因为受众无法质疑他们遵循的规范的有效性。通过立法过程，“持续的矛盾风险得以在持续的话语中维持”并“转化为假定理性的政治意见和意志形成的生产力”。特别是，主观自由与强制之间悖论性增高的紧张要求立法过程中的理性要求相应地高。然而，法律的规范性自我理解，像所有生活世界组成部分一样，受到系统命令侵犯的结构性威胁。它还必须处理那些命令，其中往往“规范性未过滤的利益立场往往仅仅因为它们更强大并利用法律形式的合法化力量来掩盖它们仅仅事实上的力量而占上风”。因此，法律仍然是“社会整合的深刻模棱两可的媒介”。可以说，卢曼比话语理论推理赋予法律系统更大的自主意志，尽管正是哈贝马斯在卢曼那里抱怨缺乏规范性自主意志。 法律的双重性质也可见于其作为“传输带”的概念化：因为法律是生活世界中系统的制度化媒介，因此与所有整合机制相连，它同时也是哈贝马斯的调解领域。也就是说，通过法律，根植于具体生活条件的团结以抽象形式被传递到变得匿名的高度复杂社会的关系中，或者用语言理论的话来说，法律代码将信息从通俗语言转换成一种形式，使其对系统的特殊代码仍然可理解：“在这个意义上，法律的语言...可以在系统和生活世界之间流通的社会范围内的通信中充当变压器”。因此，哈贝马斯赋予法律远大于卢曼的重要性。它不仅限于自身的世界，而是获得了一个普遍功能，承担了社会整合的重担，并且还能在不同的沟通模式之间切换。因此，它比系统理论版本中的更开放、更少自我指涉。 2.2 内部视角：人民主权与人权的共原性 对于法律的内部分析，哈贝马斯选择了一种特殊的策略，这在文献中引起了一系列的误解。考虑到民主理论，他最初没有提出一个规范概念，而是试图重建法律的范式背景理解，即现代性的道德和实践自我理解。然而，他提出了一种新的、话语理论的“阅读”，直到现在的民主实践。因此，重点不是立即提出一个现实的替代模型，而是将迄今为止的民主制度解释为对民主自我理解的某种实践实现。他现在想以这样一种方式重建这个概念，使其能够与他自己的沟通理性概念相连，以展示民主原则尚未实现的潜力。这种典型的哈贝马斯方法，避免在真空中处理规范性，而是将其植根于社会实践，很快就导致了误解，他只关心现存的正当性。正如英格堡·毛斯恰当指出的，这种方法恰恰出于民主意图；哈贝马斯不想以专家主义的方式向公民解释他们理性地应该做出什么决定，相反，必须从他们的宪法实践中重建理性。 那么，这种重建是如何进行的呢？“我从公民必须相互承认的权利出发，如果他们想通过积极的法律合法地调节他们的共同生活”。社会存在的法律形式，由主观权利和强制力组成，是“传统伦理生活瓦解的产物”，在这方面，它不是一个规范上可以证明的原则，而仅仅是一个实际存在的原则。最初，它与民主原则毫无关系：因此，对公民来说，加入法律共同体并没有规范必要性......使用历史上现有的法律形式通过积极的法律合法地组织集体生活的决定完全是偶然的。所有社会都有可能选择不采取集体生活的法律组织。然而，当一个社会决定采纳它时，...它必须接受那些由于与后常规道德功能互补关系而产生的法律特性...这尤其包括私人自治，作为强制力的对立面。哈贝马斯现在以一种循环过程逻辑地发展了“权利体系”，在该过程中，法律代码和民主原则被共同原创地构建。循环过程旨在使这种共原性在表示中成为可能。它在任何点都不应该停止，以免结果是主观权利或民主原则优先于另一个。“从这个角度看，主观权利既是政治自主立法的‘结果’又是‘前提’，这似乎不是一个‘矛盾’，而是论点的关键”。"},{"prompt":"请将“The second moment besides the legal form is the abstract discourse principle, which is intended to assume the shape of a principle of democracy. Its only purpose is to express the meaning of post-conventional requirements of justification, that is the perspective from which norms of action can be impartially founded in the first place.65 It is, in principle, the culmination of his reflections on communicative reason. If dissension constitutes the core problem of modern socialisation, where linguistic communication practice in social interaction inevitably raises criticisable validity claims, the institutionalisation of consensual procedures for norm production necessarily follows from this. Hence the discourse principle, which can found both moral and legal norms in Habermas, is given this form: ‘Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses’^ Finally, rational discourse should ‘include any attempt to reach an under-standing over problematic validity claims insofar as this takes place under conditions of communication that enable the free processing of topics and contributions, information and reasons in the public space constituted by illoc-utionary obligations’67 In Between Facts and Norms Habermas has liberated the discourse principle from its moral-ethical one-sidedness. The focus is now no longer on the legitimacy of certain types of arguments, but on the impartiality of the proced- ures.68 When the discourse principle intertwines with the legal form, the democratic principle emerges from this69 The legal code as the language in which the legal subjects can realise their autonomy, is coupled with the demand for rational justification. The result are procedures that ‘under real conditions of lawmaking where there is simply no way of asking humanity as a whole, enable decisions to be made which “could” measure up to the standards of ideal discourse’?0 Thus the subjunctive form makes explicit that nevertheless the criteria of ideal discourse are not abandoned despite the limited possibilities of legal institutionalised democratic procedures?1 The legal code itself must not be confused with the code of legal theory in systems theory (legal/illegal), but it refers in Habermas to the egalitarian conferring of legal entitlements. It comprises therefore initially three categories of rights: the right of equal individual liberties, the right of membership in a voluntary association of consociates under the law, and the guarantee of judicial review.72 But up to now this is - in the thought experiment - only egalitarian juridification. At this juncture is determined whether the legal subjects give over their only virtual authorship to a higher power in the next step or if, on the contrary, they also realise it normatively by allowing each other reciprocal political rights to participate in democratic legislative procedures, whereby they also normatively become the authors of their individual civil liberties. For this, however, they require the discourse principle, whose medium of institutionalisation is again the legal form?3 Those categories of fundamental rights remain unsaturated until a political legislature interprets and gives them shape in response to changing circumstances?4 This does not found a dual legality - nothing is given to the legislator, she only implicitly gains liberty rights at the moment she uses the legal code?5 There is thus a dialectic, internal relation between popular sovereignty and human rights; it ‘lies in the normative content of the very mode of exercising political autonomy, a mode that is not secured simply through the grammatical form of general laws but only through the communicative form of discursive processes of opinion- and will-formation’?6 This is Habermas’ development of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s and Immanuel Kant’s republican theory of democracy after the linguistic turn. Legitimate right, which is at the same time the social- structural precondition of a durable social formation, presupposes legitimate procedures. A legal order is legitimate to the extent that it equally secures the co-original private and political autonomy of its citizens; at the same time, however, it owes its legitimacy to the forms of communication in which alone this autonomy can express and prove itself.77 The discourse principle is for Habermas an equally pure a priori, as is the ‘only innate human right’ for Kant. Both postulate the conditions of legitimacy counter-factually. In Habermas this is the ideal speech situation as the idealist precondition of any constitutional practice which lays claim to reason. ‘Regardless of the actual strategic motivations and interests of constitutional law-giving and constitutional praxis, a critical standard is established through these principles without which the description of reality would be cynical’.78 Finally, Habermas formulates the presuppositions for protecting this system of rights largely from the imperatives of the administrative system. Habermas argues very much in the Kantian tradition that the legal medium already presupposes a political power. For the reciprocal conferral of rights remains a metaphorical event and cannot become permanent unless state power is established with the force of the barracks and put to work?9 However, he diverges from Kant’s concept of rights at a decisive moment, as political power is differentiated into communicative and administrative power?0 and only the latter poses a problem for the constitutional state. For communicative power, as Habermas formulates following Hannah Arendt, is nothing but the legislating power which emerged in rational procedures from the free processing of themes and contributions, information and reasons, thus corresponding to the discourse principle81 Thus it joins forces with law, and power aligns with law, very much in contrast to natural law, where both were opposed to each other. Law is thus the medium which translates communicative into administrative power; and the idea of the constitutional state has to mean that ‘... the administrative system which is steered through the power code be tied to the lawmaking communicative power and kept free of illegitimate interventions of social power (i.e., of the factual strength of privileged interests to assert them-selves)’82 3 Critique Habermas’ legal theory owes its power of persuasion to the nuances of normative and socio-structural perspective and its liberal telos. His attempt to situate law in the force field between communicative action and independent social systems, that is, in the dialectic of acting subjects and social surplus objectivity, is insightful. The following analysis of materialist legal theory will show that its overlaps with the discourse theory of law are considerable, due to their common origin in critical theory. In the following I will therefore concentrate on the differences. Here my critique focuses primarily on how Habermas simul-taneously over- and underestimates the systems. 3.1 The Refusal to Think Law as a System Firstly, on underestimating the systems: Habermas transfers all his democratic hopes and demands for solidarity to the medium of law. It is meant to achieve the self-organisation of society, stabilise expectations, make the legitimacy of the political regime possible, mediate between system and lifeworld and carry the burden of social integration. Communicative reason is initially embodied in language in general, but then takes - in particular in legal language - a particular shape. And precisely for this reason law itself cannot be a system, that is, no independent mechanism of social integration which takes place behind the back of communicative action. However, just as Luhmann places the systems, Habermas situates the existence of two - and only two - systems and law as a moment of the lifeworld. While he had just criticised Marx’s theory of value for falling into a ‘monism’, which knows only one ‘system’, namely the economy - suggesting on the contrary that it depends upon a functional supplement through an administrative system of action, which is differentiated through the medium of power83 - it is not clear why law, in particular in light of its ‘internal connection’ with political power, could not also constitute such a ‘functional supplement’^4 In particular Luhmann’s representation substantiated the systemic mechanisms of law plausibly, but Habermas does not follow this version, because he sees it as a threat to the potential for solidarity. Interestingly he evaluated law even more ambivalently in The Theory of Communicative Action, with the distinction between law as an anonymous, quasi-systemic mechanism, which colonises even the lifeworld, and a law that is still connected to the lifeworld through demands for legitimation85 While Habermas thus initially assumed that the description of the legal system in systems theory was at least descriptively adequate,86 his democratic-theoretical approach in Between Facts and Norms led to the rejection of this notion87 With the process of legislation, the legal code seems to dispose of an extensive potential which the systems do not possess. There, no mechanisms of understanding and no normative feedback seem to exist anymore. But only such a rigid separation, which describes the systemic processes completely detached from communicative action, has then to reach the conclusion that legal relationships cannot take place systematically. Finally, it is noticeable that the entanglement of law in social mechanisms of power and domination is not sufficiently illuminated and that the connection of law to power is meant to crucially consist in its close relationship to the positive form of ‘communicative power’. Or, expressed even more fundamentally: since power and domination are in general not denied in Habermas, but also not discussed, and are at most centred politically in the administrative system, law can also be accounted for relatively harmoniously.88 This constitutes a significant difference to materialist approaches, which deny that the legal form can be unharmed in an irrational and power-defined world. No matter how severely one considers the difference, it is obvious that law as part of the lifeworld is not burdened with any negative connotations: ‘All that is bad seems to come from the outside’, objected Alex Demirovic to Habermas’ social theory, ‘but what is not inquired into are the patterns of reproduction through domination of practices attributed to the lifeworld, that is of the family and sexuality, of the form of the subject, of pathological interactions and processes of meaningmaking, which have already caused so much devastation in the area of social integration and which only provided [...] the colonisation by the systems with its potential to exert influence’89 The question is how the potential of law, which it undeniably appears to possess in comparison to other immediate forms of domination, could be considered in such a way that it is not ‘de-dominated’ (Narr) and reconciled, but can be salvaged through its systemic character. In the materialist theory of law, which is reconstructed in Part 3, we will see that this potential can precisely be found in that independence of the law which is also ‘co-originally’ a reification of human relations.”翻译为中文","completion":"1.2.3 系统 除法律形式之外的第二个要素是抽象的话语原则，旨在形成民主原则的形状。其唯一目的是表达后常规的合理化要求的含义，即从哪个视角出发，行动规范可以首先公正地建立。从原则上讲，这是他对沟通理性思考的高潮。如果分歧构成了现代社会化的核心问题，那么社会互动中的语言沟通实践不可避免地提出了可批评的有效性主张，那么对规范生产的共识程序的制度化就必然随之而来。因此，哈贝马斯为道德和法律规范都提供了基础的话语原则是这样表述的：“只有那些所有可能受影响的人作为理性话语参与者都可能同意的行动规范才是有效的”。 最终，理性话语应该“包括任何试图就有问题的有效性主张达成理解的尝试，只要这是在使自由处理话题和贡献、信息和理由的沟通条件下发生的公共空间内进行的”。 在《事实与规范之间》，哈贝马斯已经将话语原则从其道德-伦理的片面性中解放出来。现在的焦点不再是特定类型的论证的合法性，而是程序的公正性。 当话语原则与法律形式交织在一起时，民主原则由此产生。法律代码作为法律主体能够实现其自主性的语言，与理性论证的要求相结合。其结果是“在立法的实际条件下，无法询问全人类，使得能够做出‘可以’达到理想话语标准的决定的程序”。因此，虚拟语气表明，尽管法律制度化的民主程序的可能性有限，理想话语的标准仍未被放弃。 法律代码本身不应与系统理论中的法律理论代码（合法/非法）混淆，但它在哈贝马斯那里指的是平等授予法律权利。因此，它起初包含三类权利：平等的个人自由权、在法律下自愿结成法律伙伴关系的成员权利，以及司法审查的保证。但直到现在，这仅仅是（在思想实验中）平等的法律化。在这个节点决定了法律主体是否在下一步将他们仅有的虚拟作者权移交给更高的权力，或者相反，他们也通过相互允许参与民主立法程序的相互政治权利来规范地实现它，从而也规范地成为他们个人民权的作者。然而，为此，他们需要话语原则，其制度化的媒介再次是法律形式。这些基本权利类别在政治立法机构根据不断变化的情况解释并塑造它们之前仍然是不完整的。这并没有创立双重合法性——立法者什么也没有获得，她只是在使用法律代码的那一刻隐含地获得了自由权利。 因此在人民主权和人权之间存在一种内在的辩证关系；它“存在于行使政治自主性的方式的规范内容中，这种方式不仅仅通过普遍法律的语法形式得以保障，而且只能通过话语过程的沟通形式的意见和意志形成过程得以保障”。这是哈贝马斯在语言转向之后发展了让-雅克·卢梭和伊曼努尔·康德的共和国民主理论。合法的权利，同时也是持久的社会形态的社会结构性前提，预设了合法的程序。 一个法律秩序在其平等保障公民的共生的私人和政治自主性的程度上是合法的；同时，它的合法性也归功于仅在这种自主性能够表达和证明自己的沟通形式中。 话语原则对哈贝马斯来说是一个同等纯粹的先验，就像康德的“唯一天赋人权”一样。两者都反事实地假设合法性条件。在哈贝马斯这里，这是理想的言语情境，作为任何声称理性的宪法实践的理想主义前提。“无论宪法立法和宪法实践的实际战略动机和利益是什么，通过这些原则建立了一个批判标准，没有这个标准，现实的描述将是愤世嫉俗的”。 最后，哈贝马斯阐述了这一权利体系在很大程度上受到行政系统命令保护的前提条件。哈贝马斯非常遵循康德传统，认为法律媒介已经预设了一个政治权力。因为权利的相互授予仍然是一种比喻性事件，除非建立具有兵营力量的国家权力并投入使用，否则不能成为永久性的。然而，他在决定性的时刻偏离了康德的权利概念，因为政治权力被区分为沟通权力和行政权力，只有后者对宪政国家构成问题。因为沟通权力，正如哈贝马斯跟随汉娜·阿伦特表述的，不过是在自由处理主题和贡献、信息和理由的理性程序中产生的立法权力，因此符合话语原则。因此它与法律联合起来，权力与法律一致，这与自然法非常不同，在那里两者是对立的。法律因此是将沟通权力转化为行政权力的媒介；宪政国家的理念必须意味着“...通过权力代码引导的行政系统应该与立法的沟通权力绑定，并且免于社会权力的非法干预（即，有特权利益主张自身的事实力量）”。"},{"prompt":"トレちゃんのウチのことずっと見てたでしょ translate english 5 options","completion":"1.

Additional data structures: If the algorithm uses additional data structures, such as arrays, lists, maps, or sets, the space complexity may increase. The space required by these data structures will depend on the size and number of elements they store. 2. Recursive functions: Recursive functions can lead to increased space complexity due to the memory required to maintain function call stacks. Each recursive call adds a new stack frame, and deep recursion can take up significant memory. 3. Dynamic memory allocation: If an algorithm dynamically allocates memory during execution, the space complexity will increase. This can happen when creating new objects, arrays, or other data structures on the heap. 4. Vector and matrix operations: Algorithms that involve large vectors or matrices can have higher space complexity due to the memory needed to store these data structures.

Its only purpose is to express the meaning of post-conventional requirements of justification, that is the perspective from which norms of action can be impartially founded in the first place.65 It is, in principle, the culmination of his reflections on communicative reason. If dissension constitutes the core problem of modern socialisation, where linguistic communication practice in social interaction inevitably raises criticisable validity claims, the institutionalisation of consensual procedures for norm production necessarily follows from this. Hence the discourse principle, which can found both moral and legal norms in Habermas, is given this form: ‘Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses’^ Finally, rational discourse should ‘include any attempt to reach an under-standing over problematic validity claims insofar as this takes place under conditions of communication that enable the free processing of topics and contributions, information and reasons in the public space constituted by illoc-utionary obligations’67 In Between Facts and Norms Habermas has liberated the discourse principle from its moral-ethical one-sidedness. The focus is now no longer on the legitimacy of certain types of arguments, but on the impartiality of the proced- ures.68 When the discourse principle intertwines with the legal form, the democratic principle emerges from this69 The legal code as the language in which the legal subjects can realise their autonomy, is coupled with the demand for rational justification. The result are procedures that ‘under real conditions of lawmaking where there is simply no way of asking humanity as a whole, enable decisions to be made which “could” measure up to the standards of ideal discourse’?0 Thus the subjunctive form makes explicit that nevertheless the criteria of ideal discourse are not abandoned despite the limited possibilities of legal institutionalised democratic procedures?1 The legal code itself must not be confused with the code of legal theory in systems theory (legal/illegal), but it refers in Habermas to the egalitarian conferring of legal entitlements. It comprises therefore initially three categories of rights: the right of equal individual liberties, the right of membership in a voluntary association of consociates under the law, and the guarantee of judicial review.72 But up to now this is - in the thought experiment - only egalitarian juridification. At this juncture is determined whether the legal subjects give over their only virtual authorship to a higher power in the next step or if, on the contrary, they also realise it normatively by allowing each other reciprocal political rights to participate in democratic legislative procedures, whereby they also normatively become the authors of their individual civil liberties. For this, however, they require the discourse principle, whose medium of institutionalisation is again the legal form?3 Those categories of fundamental rights remain unsaturated until a political legislature interprets and gives them shape in response to changing circumstances?4 This does not found a dual legality - nothing is given to the legislator, she only implicitly gains liberty rights at the moment she uses the legal code?5 There is thus a dialectic, internal relation between popular sovereignty and human rights; it ‘lies in the normative content of the very mode of exercising political autonomy, a mode that is not secured simply through the grammatical form of general laws but only through the communicative form of discursive processes of opinion- and will-formation’?6 This is Habermas’ development of Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s and Immanuel Kant’s republican theory of democracy after the linguistic turn. Legitimate right, which is at the same time the social- structural precondition of a durable social formation, presupposes legitimate procedures. A legal order is legitimate to the extent that it equally secures the co-original private and political autonomy of its citizens; at the same time, however, it owes its legitimacy to the forms of communication in which alone this autonomy can express and prove itself.77 The discourse principle is for Habermas an equally pure a priori, as is the ‘only innate human right’ for Kant. Both postulate the conditions of legitimacy counter-factually. In Habermas this is the ideal speech situation as the idealist precondition of any constitutional practice which lays claim to reason. ‘Regardless of the actual strategic motivations and interests of constitutional law-giving and constitutional praxis, a critical standard is established through these principles without which the description of reality would be cynical’.78 Finally, Habermas formulates the presuppositions for protecting this system of rights largely from the imperatives of the administrative system. Habermas argues very much in the Kantian tradition that the legal medium already presupposes a political power. For the reciprocal conferral of rights remains a metaphorical event and cannot become permanent unless state power is established with the force of the barracks and put to work?9 However, he diverges from Kant’s concept of rights at a decisive moment, as political power is differentiated into communicative and administrative power?0 and only the latter poses a problem for the constitutional state. For communicative power, as Habermas formulates following Hannah Arendt, is nothing but the legislating power which emerged in rational procedures from the free processing of themes and contributions, information and reasons, thus corresponding to the discourse principle81 Thus it joins forces with law, and power aligns with law, very much in contrast to natural law, where both were opposed to each other. Law is thus the medium which translates communicative into administrative power; and the idea of the constitutional state has to mean that ‘... the administrative system which is steered through the power code be tied to the lawmaking communicative power and kept free of illegitimate interventions of social power (i.e., of the factual strength of privileged interests to assert them-selves)’82 3 Critique Habermas’ legal theory owes its power of persuasion to the nuances of normative and socio-structural perspective and its liberal telos. His attempt to situate law in the force field between communicative action and independent social systems, that is, in the dialectic of acting subjects and social surplus objectivity, is insightful. The following analysis of materialist legal theory will show that its overlaps with the discourse theory of law are considerable, due to their common origin in critical theory. In the following I will therefore concentrate on the differences. Here my critique focuses primarily on how Habermas simul-taneously over- and underestimates the systems. 3.1 The Refusal to Think Law as a System Firstly, on underestimating the systems: Habermas transfers all his democratic hopes and demands for solidarity to the medium of law. It is meant to achieve the self-organisation of society, stabilise expectations, make the legitimacy of the political regime possible, mediate between system and lifeworld and carry the burden of social integration. Communicative reason is initially embodied in language in general, but then takes - in particular in legal language - a particular shape. And precisely for this reason law itself cannot be a system, that is, no independent mechanism of social integration which takes place behind the back of communicative action. However, just as Luhmann places the systems, Habermas situates the existence of two - and only two - systems and law as a moment of the lifeworld. While he had just criticised Marx’s theory of value for falling into a ‘monism’, which knows only one ‘system’, namely the economy - suggesting on the contrary that it depends upon a functional supplement through an administrative system of action, which is differentiated through the medium of power83 - it is not clear why law, in particular in light of its ‘internal connection’ with political power, could not also constitute such a ‘functional supplement’^4 In particular Luhmann’s representation substantiated the systemic mechanisms of law plausibly, but Habermas does not follow this version, because he sees it as a threat to the potential for solidarity. Interestingly he evaluated law even more ambivalently in The Theory of Communicative Action, with the distinction between law as an anonymous, quasi-systemic mechanism, which colonises even the lifeworld, and a law that is still connected to the lifeworld through demands for legitimation85 While Habermas thus initially assumed that the description of the legal system in systems theory was at least descriptively adequate,86 his democratic-theoretical approach in Between Facts and Norms led to the rejection of this notion87 With the process of legislation, the legal code seems to dispose of an extensive potential which the systems do not possess. There, no mechanisms of understanding and no normative feedback seem to exist anymore. But only such a rigid separation, which describes the systemic processes completely detached from communicative action, has then to reach the conclusion that legal relationships cannot take place systematically. Finally, it is noticeable that the entanglement of law in social mechanisms of power and domination is not sufficiently illuminated and that the connection of law to power is meant to crucially consist in its close relationship to the positive form of ‘communicative power’. Or, expressed even more fundamentally: since power and domination are in general not denied in Habermas, but also not discussed, and are at most centred politically in the administrative system, law can also be accounted for relatively harmoniously.88 This constitutes a significant difference to materialist approaches, which deny that the legal form can be unharmed in an irrational and power-defined world. No matter how severely one considers the difference, it is obvious that law as part of the lifeworld is not burdened with any negative connotations: ‘All that is bad seems to come from the outside’, objected Alex Demirovic to Habermas’ social theory, ‘but what is not inquired into are the patterns of reproduction through domination of practices attributed to the lifeworld, that is of the family and sexuality, of the form of the subject, of pathological interactions and processes of meaningmaking, which have already caused so much devastation in the area of social integration and which only provided [...] the colonisation by the systems with its potential to exert influence’89 The question is how the potential of law, which it undeniably appears to possess in comparison to other immediate forms of domination, could be considered in such a way that it is not ‘de-dominated’ (Narr) and reconciled, but can be salvaged through its systemic character. In the materialist theory of law, which is reconstructed in Part 3, we will see that this potential can precisely be found in that independence of the law which is also ‘co-originally’ a reification of human relations.”翻译为中文","completion":"“法律形式之外的第二个要素是抽象的话语原则，该原则旨在形成民主原则。其唯一目的是表达后常规的正当性要求的含义，即从哪个视角出发，行动规范能够在首位被公正地建立。这原则在原则上，是他对沟通理性反思的高潮。如果分歧构成了现代社会化的核心问题，那么社会互动中的语言沟通实践不可避免地提出了可批评的有效性要求，那么规范生产的共识程序的制度化就从这一点出发成为必然。因此，话语原则，可以在哈贝马斯那里为道德和法律规范奠基，被给予这样的形式：‘只有所有可能受影响的人作为理性话语参与者所能同意的行动规范才是有效的。’ 最终，理性话语应该‘囊括任何试图就有争议的有效性要求达成共识的尝试，只要这是在能够自由处理话题和贡献、信息和理由的沟通条件下在由言语义务构成的公共空间中进行的。’ 在《事实与规范之间》中，哈贝马斯已经将话语原则从其道德-伦理的单一性中解放出来。现在的焦点不再是某些类型论证的合法性，而是程序的公正性。 当话语原则与法律形式交织在一起时，民主原则由此产生。法律代码作为法律主体能够实现自身自治的语言，与理性正当性的要求结合在一起。结果是在法律制定的实际条件下，‘能够做出“可能”达到理想话语标准的决策’的程序。因此虚拟形式明确表明，尽管受到法律制度化民主程序可能性的限制，理想话语的标准并未被放弃。 法律代码本身不应与系统理论中的法律理论代码（合法/非法）混淆，但在哈贝马斯看来，它指的是平等授予法律权利。因此，它最初包括三类权利：平等的个人自由权，作为法律下自愿结社的同伴的成员权利，以及司法审查的保证。但到目前为止，这只是在思想实验中的平等法律化。在这个节点上决定法律主体是否在下一步将他们的唯一虚拟的作者权移交给更高的权力，或相反，他们通过允许彼此互惠的政治权利参与民主立法程序，从而也在规范上成为其个人民事自由的作者。为此，他们需要话语原则，其制度化的媒介再次是法律形式。直到政治立法机构根据变化的情况对这些基本权利进行解释和塑形，这些基本权利类别才不会保持未充分利用。这并没有创立双重合法性 - 立法者没有得到任何东西，她只有在使用法律代码时才隐含地获得自由权利。 因此，在人民主权和人权之间存在一种内在的辩证关系；它‘在于行使政治自治的模式的规范内容中，这种模式不仅仅通过一般法律的语法形式来保障，而是只通过话语过程中的观点和意愿形成的沟通形式来保障’。这是哈贝马斯在语言转向之后对让-雅克·卢梭和伊曼纽尔·康德共和国民主理论的发展。合法权利，同时也是持久社会形态的社会-结构前提，预设合法程序。 一个法律秩序在同等保障其公民原生私人和政治自治的程度上是合法的；然而，它的合法性也归功于只有在这种自治能够表达和证明其自身的沟通形式中。 对哈贝马斯而言，话语原则就如同康德所说的‘唯一天赋人权’一样，是同样纯粹的先验。两者都逆事实地假设合法性条件。在哈贝马斯这里，这是理想言论情境作为任何声称合理的宪法实践的理想主义前提。‘不管宪法授予和宪法实践的实际战略动机和利益如何，这些原则通过建立一个批评标准来说明，没有它现实的描述将是愤世嫉俗的。’ 最后，哈贝马斯阐述了从行政系统的命令中保护这一权利制度的前提条件。哈贝马斯非常符合康德传统，认为法律媒介已经预设了政治权力。因为权利的相互授予仍然是一个比喻性事件，除非国家权力以军营的力量建立并发挥作用，否则它不能成为永久的。然而，他在一个决定性的时刻与康德的权利观念分道扬镳，因为政治权力被区分为沟通权力和行政权力，而只有后者对宪政国家构成问题。因为沟通权力，正如哈贝马斯继汉娜·阿伦特之后所表述，不过是在自由处理主题和贡献、信息和理由的理性程序中产生的立法权力，因此符合话语原则。因此它与法律联合起来，权力与法律一致，这与自然法律大不相同，后者把两者视为对立。因此，法律是将沟通权力转化为行政权力的媒介；而宪政国家的理念必须意味着‘...通过权力代码引导的行政系统应该与制定法律的沟通权力绑定，并且保持远离社会权力的非法干预（即，特权利益主张自己的事实力量）’ 3.批评 哈贝马斯的法律理论之所以具有说服力，归功于其规范和社会结构视角的细腻及其自由主义的目标。他试图将法律置于沟通行动和独立社会系统之间的力场中，即主体行动和社会超额客观性的辩证法之间，这是有见地的。下面对唯物主义法律理论的分析将显示，由于它们在批判理论中的共同起源，其与法的话语理论的重合之处是相当大的。接下来我因此将专注于差异。这里我的批评主要集中于哈贝马斯同时高估和低估了系统。 3.1 拒绝将法律视为一个系统 首先是低估系统：哈贝马斯将他所有的民主希望和团结要求转移到法律媒介上。它旨在实现社会的自我组织，稳定期望，使政治制度的合法性成为可能，介于系统和生活世界之间进行调解，并承担社会整合的重担。沟通理性最初体现在一般语言中，但然后特别是在法律语言中采取了特定形式。正因为这个原因，法律本身不能成为一个系统，即不是一个独立的社会整合机制，它发生在沟通行动的背后。然而，正如卢曼将系统放置的那样，哈贝马斯认定存在两个——且仅有两个——系统和法律作为生活世界的一个时刻。当他批评马克思的价值理论陷入一个‘单一主义’，这种单一主义只知道一个‘系统’，即经济——相反地暗示它依赖于通过权力媒介差异化的行动行政系统的功能补充——尚不清楚为什么法律，特别是鉴于它与政治权力的‘内在联系’，也不能构成这样一个‘功能补充’ 尤其是卢曼的表述使得法律的系统机制颇具说服力，但哈贝马斯没有遵循这一版本，因为他认为这对团结潜力构成威胁。有趣的是，他在《沟通行动理论》中对法律进行了更加矛盾的评价，区分了法律作为一个匿名的、几乎是系统性的机制，它甚至殖民了生活世界，以及一个通过合法性要求仍与生活世界相连的法律。虽然哈贝马斯最初假定系统理论中的法律系统描述至少在描述上是充分的，但他的民主理论方法在《事实与规范之间》中导致了对这一观念的拒绝。随着立法过程的进行，法律代码似乎拥有系统所不具备的广泛潜力。在那里，似乎不存在理解机制和规范反馈。但只有这种刚性分离，它将系统过程完全与沟通行动分离开来，才不得不得出结论说法律关系不能系统地进行。 最后，值得注意的是，法律在社会权力和统治机制中的纠缠没有得到足够的阐明，而且法律与权力的关系据说主要在于它与‘沟通权力’的积极形式的密切关系。或者，更根本地表达：由于权力和统治总体上在哈贝马斯那里不被否认，但也未被讨论，而且最多在行政系统中被政治中心化，因此法律也可以被相对和谐地解释。这与唯物主义方法构成了显著的差异，后者否认法律形式在一个非理性和权力定义的世界中可以保持不受伤害。不管对差异的看法有多严重，很明显，作为生活世界的一部分的法律未受到任何负面含义的负担：‘所有坏的东西似乎都来自外部’，亚历克斯·德米罗维奇对哈贝马斯的社会理论提出异议，‘但未被质疑的是通过生活世界归因的实践的再生产模式，即家庭和性、主体形式、病态互动和意义构建的过程，它们在社会整合领域已经造成了如此巨大的破坏，并且只是为了系统的殖民提供了施加影响的潜力’ 问题是，法律的潜力，与其他直接形式的统治相比，它无疑似乎拥有的，如何能被考虑到，以使其不被‘去支配化’（Narr）和和谐化，而是通过其系统性质得到挽救。在第三部分重建的唯物主义法律理论中，我们将看到这种潜力恰恰可以在法律的那种独立性中找到，这种独立性也是人类关系的‘共原初’的物化。”"},{"prompt":"请将“3.2 Ghettoïsation of the Subjects Underestimating the expansion of the systems is at the same time connected to overestimating them, which consists of elevating them to such an extent that (communicative) action is completely halted. This is all the more astonishing as Habermas contended entirely aptly against Luhmann that the latter’s elimination of practice and normativity turned towards the affirmative.90 Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes apparent that in Habermas’s conception, action in the proper sense only occurs in the lifeworld. Therefore, law as a central coordinating mechanism also has to be part of this lifeworld. Thus while Luhmann renders the acting subjects irrelevant, Habermas ghettoises them in the lifeworld. In the systems they are mere appendages of the control media, which they can at most use with strategic intent, but that also subjects them to a strict systemic logic. This means that system operations fail once again to be resolved according to the theory of action91 In this manner Habermas’s argument is upon closer inspection downright economistic; i.e., it is as though the ‘actors’ followed the law of value or even the logic of capital. Although he is correct in saying that the media initially ‘reach through’ conscious action, it would, however, be a ‘naturalist prejudice’ to consider the economy as a space that is dominated by necessary laws,92 because this means nothing more than to eliminate politics, which are always-already present. In this sense Nancy Fraser already raised the objection against Habermas that for instance the capitalist economic system too has a moral, cultural dimension: However morally dubious the consensus and however problematic the content and status of the norms, virtually every human action context involves some form of both of them. In the capitalist marketplace, for example, strategic, utility-maximising exchanges occur against a horizon of intersubjectively shared meanings and norms; agents normally subscribe at least tacitly to some commonly held notions of reciprocity and to some shared conceptions about the social meanings of objects, including what sort of things are considered exchangeable ...93 Also, the systems have to be produced every second by the acting subjects. They are in fact open to their reflexive questioning, albeit under more difficult conditions, and have no final literal character. They are genuinely political. Whether a particular process is claimed to be systemic or not is a question of political definition. Even Luhmann’s systems theory raises this in the problem of the paradox: the basic distinction of the systems is highly precarious, it must never be questioned itself, but has to be ‘de-paradoxified’. Furthermore its closedness is itself permanently questioned; in this way, for example, the Mitbestimmungsgesetz [Codetermination Act] of 1976 can be interpreted with Ingeborg Maus as a ‘lifeworld corridor’,94 because it introduces a political correction to the ostensible economic self-reflexivity. This premise also mitigates the danger which prevents Habermas from conceiving of law as a system. 3.3 Hegemonic Consensus Habermas’s theory has a particular advantage in comparison to Luhmann’s analysis. By making (communicative) action his focus, he is also under greater constraints to provide arguments and requires more than only one mechanism of integration. If the ‘actors’ are - at least in the lifeworld - more than mere con-structions of the systems, then he has to show that the systems depend on them and on their contributions to the shaping of society. Habermas stresses that they have to be ‘integrated’ through their consent to this society and therefore rejects the conception of the legal system as a self-legitimating circular process: ‘This is already contradicted by the evidence that democratic institutions of freedom disintegrate without the initiatives of a population accustomed to freedom’95 Particularly instructive, therefore, are his explanations about the shared pre- categorical background consensus, as well as the intentional mechanisms of consent. He is thus able to show that it is unrealistic to conceive of all social behaviour as strategic action in the utilitarian sensed6 Each coordination of action has an intersubjective dimension that is based both on shared knowledge and consent. Action that is purely motivated by interest pushes up against its limits in the preconditions for intersubjectivity.97 Consensus is therefore a crucial precondition for social action. In the framing of this consensus the absence of politics in his conception becomes, however, noticeable, for it seems possible to determine the ‘good reasons’ objectively. Admittedly, Habermas notes that reasons are no dispositions for having opinions that can be described naturalistically, but rather the ‘currency used in a discursive exchange’98 However, his definition of rational discourse suggests that there is a possibility to protect reasons in such a way from social impregnations; that they gain their own dignity via their being undertaken in procedures: These can be seen as arrangements that have an effect on the preferences of participants; they screen the topics and contributions, information and reasons in such a way that, ideally, only the ‘valid’ inputs pass through the filter of fair bargaining and rational discourses.99 Here he is right insofar as interests have to become general to prevail in modern society. He blocks out, however, that those procedural filters do not produce pure practical reason. ‘The thought that there could be a state of communication which would be such that the games of truth could circulate freely, without obstacles, without constraint, and without coercive effects, seems to me to be Utopia’100 - thus Foucault’s objection to Habermas. At this point the coercive effects are clearly revealed; they are the filters themselves. They are permeable for certain arguments, which thus at the same time acquire the dignity of ‘validity’. Those filters are themselves already socially impregnated. They only let those arguments enter the procedures in which a particular interest has succeeded in articulating its own concern as general. Moreover, the channels themselves are shaped by domination,101 for the implicit standard for the rationality of communications has a selective and excluding effect.W2 One must agree with Habermas when he makes consensus a central category of social theory, and connects it to the necessity of the generalisation of interests. The question is, however, to understand this consensus with Gramsci as ‘hegemonic’ (see Part 2). Such a Gramscian theory of hegemony can in turn learn from Habermas which different technologies of consensus-production can be imagined. 3.4 Blocking out Gender Relations While class relations remain at least rudimentarily present in Habermas, he participates like Luhmann in blocking out the question of gender. Unlike the latter, he at least tries to accommodate feminist theory in Between Facts and Norms, after it had reared its head in the context of The Theory of Communicative Action. Then Nancy Fraser in particular harshly objected that ‘Habermas says virtually nothing about gender’ and produces an ‘unthematised gender subtext’.io3 Thus his theory becomes ‘in important respects androcentric and ideological’.104 She based this criticism in particular on the dualistic concept of system and lifeworld, because it assigns the tasks that are socially assigned to women, such as raising children and caring for relatives, to the lifeworld, while the official economy is described as a differentiated system, which functions according to purely systemic mechanisms. He exaggerates the differences, which separate the socially necessary activities in the two areas and ignores ‘the fact that in both spheres women are subordinated to men’. He is therefore unable to consider the dimension of male domination in modern societies.W5 This also manifests itself in that the roles of the ‘actors’ both in the lifeworld and in the systems are not neutral, but gendered roles. Gender identity as a central category is alien to Habermas.W6 This ‘gender blindness’ ultimately shows in how Habermas uses gender as an ascriptive characteristic and thus cannot adequately look into a central structuring principle of capitalist socialisation^7 How then does Habermas react to this criticism in Between Facts and Norms? Jean L. Cohen reaches the conclusion that ‘he has not only corrected for his earlier “gender blindness” but he has also made what I take to be an extremely important contribution to the “equality/difference” debate ...’W8 How then does Habermas correct his concept and what constitutes his particular contribution to feminist debate? In his last chapter he turns to political conclusions and demands a new legal paradigm, that is, a new concept of legal communities with regards to the question of how the legal system can be actualised in the perceived context of a given society.109 In doing so, he develops in contrast to the liberal paradigm of bourgeois formal law and its successor, law as it is materialised in the socialwelfare state, a third way: a procedural paradigm of law, in which again the forms of communication are brought to the fore, through which private and political autonomy can be expressed. In this context he turns to the critique made by feminist legal theorists, in particular that of Iris Marion Young (1990) and Catharine MacKinnon (1989). Habermas takes up their critique, that each special legal regulation which is intended to compensate for the disadvantages of women, rests on an interpretation of differences. And to the extent that legislation and adjudication are orientated by traditional interpretive patterns, regulatory law even consolidates the existing stereotype of gender identity)10 He suggests instead that the difference between the genders needs to be conceived as a relationship involving two equally problematic variables and in need of interpretation. In this way the orientation towards normal masculinity can be avoided.111 However, as all his hopes, as shown, are based on legal rights, he does not share a more extensive critique of rights which ‘also throw[s] out the idea of realising rights in any way\\" - thus Habermas’ interpretation of the feminist approach. Rather, he proposes his discursive model of rights and believes that discussions of gender are also well-placed within the proceduralist paradigm, namely that public discussions must first clarify the aspects under which differences ... become relevant’. He now understands gender identity as a social construction, which also has to be consciously formed. Binary gender as such is, however, not questioned, as the constructions are considered to ‘crystallise around biological differences’.n2 He demands instead programmes which articulate the relevant aspects for defining equal and unequal treatment beforehand. Habermas’s central concern is that no binding gender identity is socially predefined; neither an essentialist nor an ‘androgynous’ one. And he offers feminist theorists the parting advice that ‘competing views about the identity of the sexes and their relation to each other must be open to public discussion. Even the feminist avant-garde does not have a monopoly on definition’.n3 According to his utopia, all social conflicts, including between genders, must be conducted in rational, legal procedures. In principle one has to agree with Cohen that Habermas here really provides an ambitious contribution in the theory of democracy to the debate about difference; that is, his suggestion to dissolve all essentialisms by giving them over to public discussions. Yet this suggestion suffers again from an inflated understanding of law. For only when right is not on the side of the power technologies, only when it can assume the procedural guarantees that the potential of action orientated towards understanding can also prevail under power-based social conditions, because the better argument, which could moreover actually be determined, can be institutionalised - only then would it be possible to break up the ‘male dominance ... intrinsic ... to capitalism’n4 by means of legal procedures. Only then would a hegemonic discourse be excluded from those procedures, where it could otherwise also secure its power of definition. MacKinnon contests this very possibility because of its approach to theories of power: what is crucial is not difference, but its hierarchisation. Hierarchy is a product of power relations and those need to be attacked, instead of being governed by the hope that they could simply be banned from the arena of legal discourse.115”翻译为中文","completion":"3.2 对主体的隔离化 低估系统的扩张同时也与过高估计它们相连，这包括将它们提升到如此程度以至于（沟通）行动完全停止。这尤其令人惊讶，因为哈贝马斯完全恰当地反对卢曼，后者剔除了实践和规范性，转向肯定。然而，仔细检查后，变得明显的是，在哈贝马斯的概念中，适当意义上的行动只发生在生活世界中。因此，作为中心协调机制的法律也必须是这个生活世界的一部分。因此，虽然卢曼使行动的主体变得不相关，哈贝马斯则将它们隔离在生活世界中。在系统中，它们仅仅是控制媒介的附属物，最多只能以战略意图使用，但这也使它们受到严格的系统逻辑的限制。这意味着系统操作再次未能根据行动理论得到解决。 以这种方式仔细检查哈贝马斯的论点，实际上是经济决定论；也就是说，就好像“行动者”遵循价值规律甚至是资本逻辑。尽管他正确地指出媒介最初“穿透”有意识的行动，然而，将经济视为一个由必然规律主宰的领域将是“自然主义偏见”，因为这无异于消除了始终存在的政治。在这个意义上，南希·弗雷泽已经针对哈贝马斯提出反对，例如资本主义经济系统也具有道德、文化维度： 尽管共识在道德上存疑且规范的内容和地位存在问题，几乎每一个人类行动语境都涉及到二者的某种形式。例如，在资本主义市场中，战略性的、以效用最大化的交换发生在互为主体共享的意义和规范的地平线上；行为者通常至少默认地接受一些共同认可的互惠概念以及对对象的社会意义的一些共享观念，包括哪些事物被视为可交换的...... 同样，系统必须由行动主体每秒产生。它们实际上对它们的反思性质疑是开放的，尽管在更困难的条件下，且没有最终的字面特征。它们是真正的政治性的。特定过程是否被认为是系统性的是一个政治定义的问题。即使是卢曼的系统理论也在悖论问题中提出了这一点：系统的基本区分非常不稳定，它本身绝不能被质疑，但必须被“去悖论化”。此外，它的封闭性本身也在不断受到质疑；这样，例如，1976年的《共同决定法》可以根据英格堡·毛斯的解释被视为“生活世界走廊”，因为它对表面上的经济自反性引入了政治性修正。这个前提也减轻了阻止哈贝马斯将法律视为一个系统的风险。 3.3 霸权共识 与卢曼的分析相比，哈贝马斯的理论具有特定的优势。通过将（沟通）行动作为他的焦点，他也受到更大的限制来提供论据，并且需要不止一种整合机制。如果“行动者”至少在生活世界中不仅仅是系统的构造，则他必须表明系统依赖于他们以及他们对社会形态的贡献。哈贝马斯强调，他们必须通过同意这个社会而被“整合”，因此拒绝了将法律系统视为自我合法化循环过程的观念：“这已经被证据所反驳，即没有习惯于自由的人口的主动性，民主自由机构就会瓦解” 因此，特别说明的是他关于共享的非范畴性背景共识以及同意的有意机制的解释。因此，他能够表明，将所有社会行为视为实用主义意义上的战略行动是不现实的。每一个行动的协调都具有基于共享知识和同意的主观间维度。纯粹出于利益的行动在主观间性的前提条件中遭遇了极限。因此，共识是社会行动的关键前提条件。 在这个共识的构建中，他的概念中政治的缺席变得明显，因为似乎可以客观地确定“好的理由”。诚然，哈贝马斯注意到理由不是可以自然主义地描述为持有观点的倾向，而是“在话语交换中使用的货币”。然而，他对理性话语的定义表明，有可能以某种方式保护理由免受社会印记；它们通过在程序中的承担获得了自己的尊严： 这可以被看作是对参与者偏好产生影响的安排；它们以这样一种方式筛选主题和贡献、信息和理由，以便理想情况下，只有“有效”的输入能通过公平交易和理性话语的过滤器。在这里，他是正确的，因为利益必须变得普遍才能在现代社会中获胜。然而，他忽略了这些程序过滤器不会产生纯粹的实践理性。“认为有一种沟通状态，使得真理的游戏可以自由地、无障碍地、无约束地、无强制效果地流通，这在我看来是乌托邦” - 这是福柯对哈贝马斯的反对。在这一点上，强制效应被清楚地揭示出来；它们是过滤器本身。它们对某些论点是可渗透的，从而同时获得“有效性”的尊严。这些过滤器本身已经受到社会印记。它们只让那些能够将自己的关切作为普遍关切表达出来的特定利益的论点进入程序。此外，渠道本身也受到支配的塑造，因为通信的合理性的隐含标准具有选择性和排除性效果。 当哈贝马斯使共识成为社会理论的中心范畴，并将其与利益的普遍化的必要性联系起来时，必须同意他。然而，问题在于，要根据格拉姆西将这种共识理解为“霸权性的”（见第二部分）。这样一种格拉姆西式的霸权理论反过来可以从哈贝马斯那里学到哪些不同的共识生产技术是可以想象的。 3.4 忽视性别关系 虽然阶级关系在哈贝马斯那里至少是残留地存在的，但他像卢曼一样忽视了关于性别的问题。与后者不同的是，他至少试图在《事实与规范之间》中容纳女性主义理论，在《沟通行动理论》的背景下出现。然后，尤其是南希·弗雷泽严厉指出“哈贝马斯几乎没有提及性别”并产生了一个“未被主题化的性别副文本”。因此，他的理论在重要方面是男性中心和意识形态化的。她特别基于系统和生活世界的二元概念提出了这一批评，因为它将社会分配给女性的任务，如抚养孩子和照顾亲属，归于生活世界，而官方经济则被描述为一个根据纯粹系统机制运作的分化系统。他夸大了两个领域中社会必需活动之间的差异，并忽视了“在这两个领域中，女性都被男性所支配”的事实。因此，他无法考虑到现代社会中男性支配的维度。这也表现在生活世界和系统中的“行动者”角色并非中性，而是性别化的角色。性别身份作为一个核心范畴对哈贝马斯来说是陌生的。这种“性别盲视”最终表现在哈贝马斯如何将性别作为一个归属特征使用，因此无法充分考察资本主义社会化的一个核心结构原则。 那么哈贝马斯在《事实与规范之间》中如何回应这一批评呢？让·L·科恩得出结论说“他不仅纠正了他早期的‘性别盲视’，而且我认为他对‘平等/差异’辩论做出了极其重要的贡献......”哈贝马斯如何纠正他的概念，以及他对女性主义辩论做出了什么特殊贡献？ 在他的最后一章中，他转向政治结论，并要求一个新的法律范式，即关于法律制度如何在给定社会的感知背景下实现的新的法律社群概念。在此，他与资产阶级形式法的自由主义范式及其继任者、在社会福利国家中具体化的法律相反，提出了第三条路线：一种程序性法律范式，其中再次突出了通过私人和政治自治能够表达的沟通形式。在这个背景下，他转向女性法律理论家的批评，特别是艾丽斯·马里昂·扬（1990年）和凯瑟琳·麦金农（1989年）的批评。哈贝马斯接受了她们的批评，即每一项旨在补偿女性劣势的特殊法律规定，都基于对差异的解释。而且在立法和裁决受到传统解释模式的指导时，规范性法律甚至巩固了性别身份的现有刻板印象。他建议，性别之间的差异需要被理解为涉及两个同样具有问题的变量且需要解释的关系。这样，就可以避免朝向正常男性化的取向。 然而，正如所示，由于他所有的希望都基于法律权利，他不分享更广泛的对权利的批评，这种批评“也抛弃了以任何方式实现权利的想法” - 这是哈贝马斯对女性主义方法的解释。相反，他提出了他的话语模型的权利，并相信性别讨论也很适合程序主义范式，即公共讨论必须首先澄清在哪些方面差异......变得相关。他现在理解性别身份是一种社会构建，也必须有意识地形成。然而，二元性别本身并未受到质疑，因为构建被认为是“围绕生物学差异凝结”。他要求的是事先制定程序，明确定义平等和不平等待遇的相关方面。哈贝马斯的中心关切是，没有任何既定的性别身份被社会预定义；既不是本质主义的，也不是“双性同体”的。他向女性主义理论家提供的临别忠告是，“关于两性的身份及其相互关系的竞争观点必须对公共讨论开放。即使是女性主义先锋也没有定义的垄断权”。根据他的乌托邦，所有社会冲突，包括性别之间的冲突，都必须通过理性的法律程序进行。 原则上必须同意科恩，哈贝马斯在这里确实为关于差异的民主理论辩论提供了一个雄心勃勃的贡献；也就是说，他建议通过将所有本质主义交给公共讨论来解散它们。然而，这个建议再次受到对法律理解的夸大的困扰。因为只有当权利不在强权技术一方，只有当它可以承担程序保证，以致于在基于权力的社会条件下，理解导向的行动潜力也能够获胜，因为更好的论点，而且实际上可以确定的论点，可以被制度化——只有那时，才有可能通过法律程序打破“固有......于资本主义”的“男性支配”。只有那时，霸权话语才会被排除在这些程序之外，否则它也可能确保其定义权。麦金农由于其权力理论的方法挑战了这种可能性：关键不是差异，而是它的等级化。等级是权力关系的产物，需要被攻击，而不是抱着希望它们可以简单地被禁止进入法律话语的领域。"},{"prompt":"ما هى مطابخ الخشمونيوم","completion":"مطابخ الخشمونيوم هي نوع من المطابخ التي يتم تصميمها وتصنيعها باستخدام مادة تُعرف بـ \\"الخشمونيوم\\"، وهي مادة تجمع بين خصائص الخشب والألومنيوم. يعتبر الخشمونيوم اختيارًا شائعًا للمطابخ لعدة أسباب، منها المظهر الجمالي الذي يجمع بين دفء الخشب وحداثة ومتانة الألومنيوم، بالإضافة إلى العديد من المزايا الأخرى. # مميزات مطابخ الخشمونيوم 1. **المتانة والقوة**: يوفر الخشمونيوم متانة كبيرة ويقاوم الخدوش والتآكل، مما يجعله خيارًا دائمًا للاستخدام الطويل. 2. **مقاومة للماء**: هذا النوع من المطابخ يقاوم الرطوبة والماء، مما يجعله مثاليًا للبيئات التي تتعرض فيها المطابخ للماء بشكل مستمر. 3. **سهولة الصيانة والتنظيف**: يسهل تنظيف مطابخ الخشمونيوم وصيانتها بسبب سطحها الأملس، مما يساعد في الحفاظ على نظافة المطبخ بشكل فعال وسريع. 4. **مقاومة للحشرات**: بطبيعته، الخشمونيوم لا يجذب الحشرات كالنمل والصراصير، مما يساهم في الحفاظ على نظافة المطبخ وصحته. 5. **تنوع التصاميم والألوان**: يمكن تصنيع الخشمونيوم بألوان وتصاميم مختلفة تناسب أذواق العملاء المتنوعة وتلائم ديكورات مختلفة للمطابخ. # استخدامات مطابخ الخشمونيوم بفضل هذه المميزات، تُستخدم مطابخ الخشمونيوم على نطاق واسع في المنازل الحديثة والشقق وحتى في بعض الأماكن التجارية كالمطاعم والمقاهي التي تتطلب مطابخ بمتانة عالية وسهولة في الصيانة. # الخلاصة مطابخ الخشمونيوم تجمع بين جمالية الخشب وخصائص الألومنيوم العملية، مما يجعلها خيارًا مثاليًا لأي شخص يبحث عن مطبخ عصري، عملي، ودائم."},{"prompt":"ما هى المطابخ الخشمنيوم ؟ وايه الفرق بينها وبين الكلادينج","completion":"المطابخ الخشمنيوم هي نوع من المطابخ تتكون من مزيج بين خامات الخشب والألمنيوم. يُفضل استخدامها كخيار متين وعملي لأثاث المطبخ. تجمع هذه المطابخ بين متانة الألمنيوم وجمال مظهر الخشب، مما يوفر حلًا ممتازًا يجمع بين الأناقة والقوة. الفرق بين المطابخ الخشمنيوم والكلادينج يكمن في المواد المستخدمة وتطبيقاتها. 1. **المواد المستخدمة**: -

Основное отличие между этими двумя типами диаграмм заключается в уровне детализации и сложности, которые они могут представить. # ER-диаграмма (Entity-Relationship Diagram): - Простая ER-диаграмма представляет сущности в базе данных и отношения между ними. - Основные элементы включают сущности, атрибуты сущностей и связи между сущностями. - Поддерживает три основных типа связей: один-к-одному, один-ко-многим и многие-ко-многим. Основное назначение ER-диаграмм — обеспечить общее понимание структуры базы данных, сфокусировавшись на главных сущностях и связях между ними. # EER-диаграмма (Extended Entity-Relationship Diagram): - EER-диаграмма представляет собой расширенную версию ER-диаграммы, дополняя её новыми элементами для лучшего представления более сложных структур данных. - Вводит дополнительные концепции, такие как категоризация (или обобщение), специализация, агрегация и наследование, что позволяет моделировать иерархические отношения и полиморфизм. - Позволяет точнее описывать сложные связи и ограничения в базе данных, которые не могут быть полностью представлены в стандартной ER-диаграмме. EER-диаграммы используются для более детального и точного моделирования баз данных, особенно когда требуется отобразить более сложные отношения и структуры данных. # Вывод: В то время как ER-диаграммы предоставляют высокоуровневое описание структуры базы данных, сфокусированное на основных сущностях и связях между ними, EER-диаграммы предлагают более продвинутые возможности для изображения сложных структур и отношений, включая наследование и специализацию.Выбор между ER и EER зависит от специфики задачи и сложности проектируемой базы данных."},{"prompt":"напиши нф таблиц","completion":"Нормальные формы (НФ) таблиц в базе данных — это ключевой концептуальный инструмент, используемый для анализа и оптимизации схем баз данных с целью уменьшения избыточности и устранения нежелательных явлений, таких как аномалии вставки, удаления и обновления. Всё это делается для улучшения целостности и производительности базы данных.

第1步：准备工作 确保您已安装以下Python库：`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` 如果尚未安装，请使用pip安装： ```sh pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn ``` # 第2步：数据预处理 首先，加载数据。假设您的数据保存在名为`flights_data.csv`的CSV文件中，您可以使用`pandas`库来加载数据。 ```python import pandas as pd # 加载数据 data = pd.read_csv(\'flights_data.csv\') # 查看前几行数据 print(data.head()) ``` 接着，进行必要的数据预处理，比如处理缺失值、转换数据类型等。 ```python # 检查缺失值 print(data.isnull().sum()) # 填充或删除缺失值 # data.fillna(method=\'ffill\', inplace=True) # 前项填充 # data.dropna(inplace=True) # 或者删除包含缺失值的行 # 确保所有数据列的数据类型正确 # 根据实际情况转换数据类型，例如： # data[\'时间戳\'] = pd.to_datetime(data[\'时间戳\']) ``` # 第3步：特征选择 从您提供的变量中选择用于聚类的特征。 ```python features = data[[\'经度\', \'纬度\', \'高度\', \'x坐标\', \'y坐标\', \'时间戳\', \'地速\', \'航向\', \'垂直速度\']] ``` # 第4步：执行聚类 使用机器学习算法对航班轨迹进行聚类。这里以K-means聚类算法为例，首先需要确定最优的簇数量（K值）。 ```python from sklearn.cluster import KMeans import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # 寻找最佳的K值 wcss = [] for i in range(1, 11): kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=i, init=\'k-means++\', max_iter=300, n_init=10, random_state=0) kmeans.fit(features) wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_) # 绘制肘部图形 plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss) plt.title(\'Elbow Method\') plt.xlabel(\'Number of clusters\') plt.ylabel(\'WCSS\') plt.show() ``` 选择WCSS（Within-Cluster Sum of Square，簇内平方和）急剧下降开始放缓的点作为K值。 ```python # 基于肘部方法选择的K值执行K-means聚类 optimal_k = 4 # 假设最佳K值为4，具体值依据肘部图形确定 kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, init=\'k-means++\', max_iter=300, n_init=10, random_state=0) y_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(features) ``` # 第5步：结果可视化 聚类结果可通过二维或三维散点图进行可视化，这里以二维散点图为例。 ```python plt.scatter(features[y_kmeans == 0][\'经度\'], features[y_kmeans == 0][\'纬度\'], s=100, c=\'red\', label =\'Cluster 1\') plt.scatter(features[y_kmeans == 1][\'经度\'], features[y_kmeans == 1][\'纬度\'], s=100, c=\'blue\', label =\'Cluster 2\') plt.scatter(features[y_kmeans == 2][\'经度\'], features[y_kmeans == 2][\'纬度\'], s=100, c=\'green\', label =\'Cluster 3\') plt.scatter(features[y_kmeans == 3][\'经度\'], features[y_kmeans == 3][\'纬度\'], s=100, c=\'cyan\', label =\'Cluster 4\') plt.title(\'Flights Clustering\') plt.xlabel(\'Longitude\') plt.ylabel(\'Latitude\') plt.legend() plt.show() ``` # 第6步：分析结果 在完成聚类之后，您可以分析每个聚类的特征，如航班的平均高度、航向以及地速等，从而获得有关特定聚类内部航班行为的洞察。 这是一个从头到尾的聚类分析流程，您可以针对不同的问题调整聚类算法、特征选择以及可视化方式来满足您的研究需求。"},{"prompt":"请使用kmeans均值算法，使用matlab作为编程工具进行聚类研究。","completion":"若要使用MATLAB进行K-means聚类分析，首先需要准备您的数据集，并确保MATLAB已正确安装在您的计算机上。下面以一个简化的例子为您展示如何通过MATLAB使用K-means算法对航班轨迹数据进行聚类分析。 #

步骤 2: 运行K-means算法 假定我们根据某些先验知识，决定将这些数据分为3个聚类： ```matlab k = 3; % 聚类数量 [IDX, C] = kmeans(data, k); % IDX为每个点的聚类索引，C为聚类中心 ``` # 步骤 3: 可视化聚类结果 对于空间数据，三维散点图是一种很好的可视化手段： ```matlab figure; % 为每个聚类绘制散点图 for i = 1:k cluster = data(IDX == i, :); scatter3(cluster(:,1), cluster(:,2), cluster(:,3), 50, \'filled\'); hold on; % 保持图像，以便绘制下一组数据 end % 标记聚类中心 scatter3(C(:,1), C(:,2), C(:,3), 100, \'kx\'); % 使用黑色的X标记聚类中心 title(\'K-means聚类结果\'); xlabel(\'纬度\'); ylabel(\'经度\'); zlabel(\'高度\'); legend([\\"聚类1\\",\\"聚类2\\",\\"聚类3\\",\\"聚类中心\\"],\\"Location\\",\\"best\\"); grid on; % 打开网格 view(3); % 三维视图 ``` 请根据您自己的数据对上述代码中的参数进行相应的调整。这个过程将使您根据经度、纬度和高度对航班轨迹数据进行了基本的聚类，并以可视化的形式展示了聚类结果。需要注意的是，在实际应用中，选择合适的聚类数量（即k值）对于获取有意义的结果至关重要，可能需要根据问题的具体情况和额外的领域知识来决定。此外，对于更复杂的数据集，可能需要预处理步骤（如特征缩放、缺失值处理等），以及在聚类后对结果的进一步分析。"},{"prompt":"在保持原题主体思想不变下，组织词句对问题进行描述。","completion":"若您是一位专注于信息技术的工程师，并面临着以经度、纬度、高度、X坐标、Y坐标、时间戳、地面速度、航道角度以及垂直速度这九个参数为基础，构建出天津机场一日中所有航班运动轨迹的聚类分析任务。请探究如何通过这些数据点，来系统地理解和划分航班轨迹的模式和群组，进而为天津机场的航班管理与调度提供数据支撑和洞见。"},{"prompt":"im training a model and in its stuck and dont proceed: Epoch 1/200 265/265 [==============================] - 163s 606ms/step - loss: 0.8305 - mae: 0.6152 - val_loss: 0.7198 - val_mae: 0.5818 Epoch 2/200 265/265 [==============================] - 161s 609ms/step - loss: 0.7090 - mae: 0.5378 - val_loss: 0.8001 - val_mae: 0.5537 Epoch 3/200 265/265 [==============================] - 161s 608ms/step - loss: 0.6255 - mae: 0.5068 - val_loss: 0.6093 - val_mae: 0.5480 Epoch 4/200 265/265 [==============================] - 162s 611ms/step - loss: 0.6609 - mae: 0.4979 - val_loss: 0.5372 - val_mae: 0.5015 Epoch 5/200 265/265 [==============================] - 241s 911ms/step - loss: 0.6276 - mae: 0.4774 - val_loss: 0.6144 - val_mae: 0.4889 Epoch 6/200 265/265 [==============================] - 326s 1s/step - loss: 0.6039 - mae: 0.4716 - val_loss: 0.6305 - val_mae: 0.5454 Epoch 7/200 243/265 [==========================>...] - ETA: 20s - loss: 0.6035 - mae: 0.4 before Epoch 7/200 all done ok but the model is not proceeding after Epoch 7/200 243/265 why? how can i fix","completion":"When your model training gets stuck at a certain epoch without any error message, it can be quite frustrating. Here are several potential causes and solutions for this issue: 1. **Hardware Resource Constraints**: Your machine may be running out of memory (RAM or GPU memory) especially as the dataset size or model complexity increases. - **Solution**: Monitor your system\'s resources (using tools like `htop` for CPU/RAM and `nvidia-smi` for GPU usage) to see if you\'re hitting limits. Consider reducing the batch size or model complexity if this is the case. 2. **Input Data Issue**: There might be a problem with the data feeding into the model at the point where it hangs. This could be due to corrupt data or issues with the data loader. - **Solution**: Check if your data pipeline is stable. Try to isolate the batch that is causing the hang by manually iterating over your data loader and inspect any potentially corrupt or unusual data entries. 3. **Inefficient Data Pipeline**: If you\'re loading data from a slow source (e.g., over the network, from a slow hard drive), your training might be IO-bound. - **Solution**: Optimize your data loading. Use prefetching, increase the number of worker threads (if you’re using PyTorch, increase the `num_workers` in your DataLoader; if using TensorFlow/Keras, consider the `prefetch` option in your dataset pipeline), or move your dataset to faster storage. 4. **Deadlock in Parallel Data Loading**: If you\'re using multiple workers for data loading (common in both TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch), there could be a deadlock situation. - **Solution**: Try reducing the number of workers to 0 or 1 to see if the issue persists. If the problem is resolved, it may be related to how your data loading and augmentation are implemented. 5. **Software Bug**: There could be a bug in the version of TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, or any other library you\'re using. - **Solution**: Update your libraries to the latest stable versions. Sometimes, specific versions of libraries might have bugs that cause hangs. 6. **Custom Callbacks or Loggers**: If you\'ve implemented any custom callbacks or logging mechanisms, they might inadvertently introduce issues. - **Solution**: Try running your model without these custom additions to see if it resolves the issue. To further diagnose and fix the issue, consider the following steps: - **Narrow Down the Issue**: Try to isolate if the problem is data-related, hardware-related, or software-related. You can achieve this by simplifying your model and data feeding process to the minimum viable setup that still demonstrates the issue. - **Enable Verbose Logging**: Increase the verbosity of your training logs to get more insight into what might be happening right before the training process hangs. - **Review Resource Usage**: Use system monitoring tools to check if there’s a spike in memory usage or if the CPU/GPU is idling during the hang, which might give clues to the issue. Finally, if none of these steps helps, consider reaching out to the community forums of the specific library you\'re using (e.g., TensorFlow\'s GitHub issues, PyTorch forums) with a detailed report of your issue, including code snippets, hardware details, and anything you\'ve tried. This might help in identifying if it\'s a known issue with a workaround or if it\'s something new that needs more investigation."},{"prompt":"merhaba. bir metin vereceğim onu özetle lütfen","completion":"Elbette, lütfen metni paylaşın."},{"prompt":"Bilgisayar Virüslerinden Ve Saldırılardan Korunma Önerileri Yazan: Barış AKÇAY, HÜ BİD Bşk.Yrd., 07.2006 Konunun son derece detaylı olması ve her bir alt başlığın uzun açıklamalar gerektirmesi dolayısıyla, burada anlatılanlar sadece basit tanımlar ve pratik bazı öneriler şeklinde olacaktır. Okuyucuların detaylı bilgi edinmesi için araştırma yapmaları gerekir. \\"Yararlı Doküman ve Link\'ler\\" bölümünde bu konuda yararlı olabilecek bazı sitelerin adresleri verilmiştir. Bazı Temel Tanımlar Bilgisayar zararlılarından korunma yöntemlerini anlatmadan önce, zaman zaman birbiri ile karıştırılabilen bazı kavramlardan bahsetmek gerekir: Virüs Bilgisayar virüsleri, genellikle bilgisayara zarar vermek, çalışmasını zorlaştırmak ya da kullanıcının çalışmasına engel olmak amacıyla yazılmış program parçalarıdır. Bu programlar tek başına durabileceği gibi, genellikle bilgisayarda bulunan başka amaçlı bir programın içine yerleşerek çalışırlar. Virüsler, bir kere çalışmayı başardıklarında kendilerini başka dosyalara da kopyalamaya çalışırlar. Bazı dosyalar, işletim sistemleri tarafından otomatik olarak ve geri planda çalıştırıldıkları için virüslü bir dosya barındıran bir bilgisayar bu dosyayı çalıştırabilir ve virüs aktif hale gelince kendini diğer dosyalara da kopyalar. Hatta virüslü bir bilgisayar, kendisine bağlı farklı medyalarda (disketler, yazılabilir flash diskler, yazma hakkı bulunan ağ paylaşımlı klasörler, vs.) bulunan dosyaları da virüslendirebilir. Virüsler, aktif hale gelmek için \\"çalıştırılmak\\" zorundadır. Başka bilinen bir işlevi olan, ancak virüs bulaşmış bir program çalıştırıldığında içine yerleşik olan virüs de aktif hale gelmiş olur. Yaygın inanışın aksine, virüslü bir disket, flash bellek, CD vb. bilgisayara yerleştirildiğinde -eğer otomatik çalıştırılan (auto-run) bir dosya yoksa- bilgisayara virüs bulaşmaz. Virüsün aktif hale gelmesi için virüslü dosyanın elle ya da işletim sistemi tarafından çalıştırılması gerekir. Virüs bulaşabilen dosyalar ilk zamanlarda sadece \\"program\\" dosyaları idi. Yani genellikle sonu \\".exe, .com, .pif\\" ile biten dosyalardı. Ancak yazılım teknolojisinin gelişimi, \\"çalıştırılabilen\\" dosya tiplerinin artması ve işletim sistemlerinin karmaşıklaşması ile birlikte potansiyel tehlike oluşturan dosya tipleri de arttı. Bir zamanlar sadece \\"metin\\" dosyası olarak bilinen \\".doc\\" uzantılı dosyalar, ofis yazılımlarının ilerlemesi ile içine \\"çalıştırılabilen\\" programcıkların (makrolar) da yerleştirilebildiği karmaşık dosyalara dönüştü. Yine, sadece \\"resim\\" içerdiği için masum görülen \\".gif\\" uzantılı dosyalar, popüler işletim sistemlerinin açıkları kullanılarak birer potansiyel virüs kaynağı haline gelebildiler. Şu anda, ekran koruyuculardan, masum dökümanlara kadar birçok dosya, \\"virüs bulaşabilir ve bulaştırabilir\\" bir hale gelmiştir. Virüsler Internet\'ten indirilen -kaynağı şüpheli- dosyalardan, virüslü e-posta eklentilerinden ve dışarıdan bilgisayara takılan disket, flash bellek, CD gibi ortamlarda bulunan virüslü dosyalardan bilgisayara gelirler. Virüslü bir bilgisayar antivirüs programları ile taratılarak tespit edilebilir. Kullanıcı, bilgisayarının çalışmasındaki aşırı yavaşlamadan da şüphelenebilir. Bazı virüsler için, antivirüs üretici firmalar Internet\'ten indirilip çalıştırılabilen küçük ve sadece o virüs tipine etkili tarayıcı/temizleyici programlar yayınlarlar. Ancak bunun bir garantisi yoktur ve virüs bilgisayarı yeniden kurana kadar temizlenemeyebilir. Hatta bazı yeni nesil virüsler bilgisayara girip uzun süre kendilerini gizleyerek kuluçkaya yatarlar. Bunlar uygun bir zamanda aktif hale geçip, bilgisayara gerekli zararı verip, hatta belki kullanıcıya ait verileri (şifreler, vs.) merkezine yollayıp kendilerini imha edebilirler ve izlerini tamamen kaybettirebilirler. Bu nedenle antivirüsler de bu noktada çaresiz kalabilirler. Yukarıda anılan virüslere \\"dosya virüsleri\\" adı verilir. Bunlardan ayrı olarak disklerin işletim sistemlerini yüklerken ilk başvurdukları bölge olan \\"boot sector\\"e yerleşen virüsler de mevcuttur. İşlevleri, görevleri ve davranış biçimleri diğer virüslerle aynıdır. Farklı olan bunların diskte daha farklı alanlarda kendilerini saklamalarındadır. Ancak bunların yaygınlıkları daha azdır. Worm (Solucan) Worm\'lar genellikle kullanılan işletim sistemlerinin yazılımındaki hata ve açıkları kullanarak ağ üzerinden bilgisayara girebilen zararlı yazılımlardır. Virüs\'lerle benzer işlevleri vardır, ancak bulaşmak için kullanıcı tarafından çalıştırılması gereken programlar değillerdir. Diğer bir deyişle, worm\'lar bilgisayar ağını tararlar ve güvenlik açığı buldukları bilgisayarlara hiç bir kullanıcı aktivitesi olmadan girerler. Yeni kurulmuş, ancak gerekli yamaları yapılmamış bir bilgisayar, Internet ağına bağlandığı anda (kablosunun takılması ve gerekli IP ayarlarının yapılması) worm kapabilir. Worm\'lardan korunmanın en iyi yolu, bilgisayarı ilk kurarken işletim sistemlerinin çıkmış en son versiyonu ile kurmak, güncellemeleri takip etmek ve uygulamak, bir kişisel firewall kullanarak dışarıdan gelebilecek ataklara karşı kapıları kapatmak ve tüm bu önlemler alındıktan sonra bilgisayarı fiziksel olarak Internet\'e bağlamaktan geçmektedir. Bazı worm\'lar zaman zaman o kadar agresif olmuşlardır ki, daha bilgisayar ilk kurulup güncelleme yapmak için Internet\'e bağlandığı anda bilgisayara sızmayı başarabilmişlerdir. Worm girmiş bir bilgisayar, kullanıcının haberi olmadan sürekli olarak bulunduğu ağ üzerinden tüm Internet ağına saldırıda bulunup milyonlarca IP adresini rastgele deneyerek kendini yaymaya çalışır. Bu nedenle worm\'lu bir bilgisayar genellikle bulunduğu ağda yoğun bir trafik oluşturacağından o bölgenin Internet erişimini olumsuz yönde etkileyebilir. Worm\'lu bir bilgisayarın bu \\"hastalığı\\" antivirüs programları ile taratılarak tespit edilebileceği gibi, ağ trafiğinde yarattığı yoğun aktiviteden de anlaşılabilir. Bazı worm\'lar için antivirüs üretici firmalar Internet\'ten indirilip çalıştırılabilen küçük ve sadece o worm tipine etkili tarayıcı/temizleyici programlar yayınlarlar. Ancak bunun bir garantisi yoktur ve worm bilgisayarı yeniden kurana kadar temizlenemeyebilir. Spyware (Casus Yazılım) Casus yazılımlar (kimi zaman Ad-ware olarak da isimlendirilir), bilgisayara çeşitli yöntemlerle bulaşabilen programlardır. Bazı işletim sistemlerinin Internet tarayıcılarının yazılım açıklarından faydalanarak Web\'de gezinirken bile bulaşabildikleri gibi, genellikle kaynağı belirli olmayan ve başka amaçlara hizmet ediyormuş gibi görünen programların çalıştırılmasıyla bulaşırlar. Internet\'ten indirilen bedava oyunlar, dosya paylaşım programları, seri numarası üreten programlar, ekran koruyucular, bazı müzik çalarlar ve diğer bir çok bedava yazılım ne yazık ki asli görevlerinin arkasında aslında birer casus yazılım olarak çalışmaktadırlar. Casus yazılımlar virüsler kadar zarar vermeye yönelik olmasa da, bilgisayarınızda bulunan verileri (şifreler, dosyalar, kredi kartı numaraları, e-posta adresleri, yazışmalar, dolaşılan web sayfalarının adresleri, vb.) çalıp uzak merkezlere iletebilirler. Bunlar bilgisayarın ya da bazı programların kullanımını yavaşlatabilir veya tamamen engelleyebilir. Casus yazılımlar yardımıyla çalınmış olan şifreler ile banka hesaplarına zarar verilebilir, hırsızlıklar yapılabilir ya da bilgisayara uzaktan bir korsanın girmesine olanak sağlanabilir. Casus yazılımların hizmet ettiği en önemli amaçlardan biri de, kişilerin Web\'de dolaşırken girip çıktığı siteleri tespit etmek ve buna dayanarak ilgi alanlarını öğrenmeye çalışmaktır. Bu bilgileri merkezlerine Internet aracılığı ile gizlice ulaştıran casus yazılımlar, daha sonra bu ilgi alanlarına uygun olarak kişilere Spam reklamlar yollayabilirler. Bilgisayar Korsanlığı (Hacking) Internet ağı üzerinde bir çok bilgisayar korsanı bulunmaktadır. Bunlar gerçek kişiler olabildikleri gibi, korsanlık yapmak amacıyla yazılmış ve amaçları Internet\'i dolaşıp bilgisayarların açıklarını araştıran robot yazılımlar da olabilirler. Kullanılan işletim sistemlerinin (Windows başta olmak üzere) açık ve hatalarından yararlanan korsanlar bilgisayara kullanıcısının haberi olmaksızın girip kontrol altına almayı hedeflerler. Bir kere bilgisayara girildikten sonra verilebilecek zarar ya da çalınabilecek bilgi tamamen korsanın insafına kalmıştır. Hatta çoğu zaman korsanlar, üniversite gibi büyük kuruluşların ana sunucu bilgisayarlarına girebilmek için önce daha korumasız olan kişisel bilgisayarlara hücum eder ve bunları kullanarak ana sistemlere girmeye çalışırlar. Korsanların kullandıkları yöntemler, özellikle zamanında açıkları yamanmamış işletim sistemlerine sahip bilgisayarların bu zaaflarından faydalanmak olduğu kadar, kullanıcıların bilgisizlik ve dikkatsizliklerinden kaynaklanan zaafları da kullanmayı içerir. Bilgisayarına giriş için hiç şifre koymayan ya da tahmin edilmesi çok kolay şifreler koyan kullanıcı aslında potansiyel bir bilgisayar korsanına davetiye çıkarmış demektir. Benzer şekilde, firewall, antivirüs, antispyware kullanmayan, zamanında güncellemeleri yapmayan kullanıcı da hem kendini hem de bulunduğu kurumu tehlikeye atmış olmaktadır. Kişisel Firewall Firewall\'lar, bilgisayar ağlarını, gelen giden verileri sürekli inceleyerek dışarıdan gelebilecek saldırılara karşı akıllı biçimlerde korumaya çalışan yazılım ya da yazılım/donanım sistemlerine verilen addır. Kişisel firewall yazılımları ise, sadece o bilgisayarı ağ üzerinden gelen saldırılara karşı korumaya yarayan ve genellikle işletim sistemine entegre olarak çalışan programlardır. İşletim sistemleri, karmaşık doğaları gereği Internet üzerinden gelebilecek saldırılara açık olabilirler. Ayrıca çalıştırılan programlar -istemli veya istemsizce- sistemde yeni açıklar oluşturabilir ve bir amaca hizmet ederken (örneğin Internet\'ten dosya indirme) bir başka şekilde de zarar verebilirler. Kişisel firewall programları sistemi, içinde kullanılan programlardan bağımsız olarak çeşitli saldırılara karşı korumayı hedefler. Kimileri bir program uzak bir yere ulaşmaya çalışıyorsa şüphelenip kullanıcıya haber verirken, kimileri bunun yanında kodları değişen (belki virüsün değiştirebileceği endişesi ile) programları takip edip uyarılar yaparlar. Çoğu firewall korsanların sıklıkla kullandığı taramaları (bilgisayardaki açıkları bulmak için araştırma) farkedip bunlara bilgisayarın cevap vermemesini sağlarlar. Ancak firewall\'lar da sonunda birer bilgisayar programı oldukları için bir kere içeri sızmayı başaran bir zararlının bunları etkisiz hale getirebilmesi de olasılık dahilindedir. Ya da zaman zaman kullanıcının bilinçsiz davranması nedeniyle kişi zararlı olabilecek bir Internet trafiğine de sistemin izin vermesini sağlayabilir. Windows\'un XP öncesi versiyonlarında ve XP\'nin Service Pack 2\'si öncesinde işletim sistemine entegre bir firewall ya yoktu ya da çok yetersizdi. XP SP2 ile beraber daha tatmin edici bir kişisel firewall da sisteme eklendi. Ancak bunun da açıklarını bulan bazı korsanlar ya da korsan yazılımlar bu yapıyı da aşmayı başarmaktadırlar. Şu anda ayrıca piyasada satılan bazı profesyonel firewall yazılımları olduğu gibi, hemen hemen aynı marifetlere sahip ama ticari olmayan kullanımı parasız yazılımlar da (Sygate Personal Firewall gibi) mevcuttur. Deneyimler göstermiştir ki, korsan olma potansiyeline sahip şifre kırıcı, ekran koruyucu, oyun vb. programları indirip kullanma eğilimi göstermeyen, lisanslı ya da kaynağı güvenlilir yazılımları kullanan, bazı koruma araçlarını bilgisayarına yüklemiş, güncellemeleri zamanında yapan bir kullanıcı için XP SP2 ve sonrası işletim sistemleri ile entegre olarak gelen firewall yazılımı yeterli görünmektedir. Antivirüs ve Antispyware Virüslere ve casus yazılımlara karşı bilgisayara yüklenen ve bunlar bilgisayara girmeye çalıştıklarında farkedip engel olan yazılımlardır. Bilgisayara yüklendikten sonra artık bilgisayar her açıldığında bunlar otomatik olarak geri planda çalışmaya başlarlar ve okunan, yazılan tüm dosyaları aynı anda kontrol ederler. Bunun da bedeli bilgisayarın çoğu zaman belirgin bir biçimde yavaş ve uzun açılması ve işlemleri olağandan daha yavaş yapması olarak ortaya çıkar. Bu tür programlar bilinen onbinlerce virüsün izini sürmeye çalıştıklarından aslında ortaya çıkan hız düşüşü yapılan işle karşılaştırıldığında oldukça kabul edilebilir düzeylerde kalır. Her iki tür tarayıcı da zaman zaman Internet üzerinden üretici firmalarına bağlanıp virüs tanımlarını güncellerler. Bu, yeni çıkan virüs ve spyware yazılımlarından haberdar olmak için gereklidir. Her antivirüs ve antispyware yazılımının tüm virüsleri bulması sözkonusu değildir. Hatta ideal bir yazılım da yoktur. Yeni çıkan ve hızla yayılan bir virüsün parmak izini bilmeyen yazılım bunu farkedemez ve virüs bilgisayara bulaşır. Hatta kimi virüsler bir kere bilgisayara bulaşınca popüler antivirüs yazılımlarını tanıyıp bunları da kullanıcıya farkettirmeden etkisiz hale getirebilirler. Kullanıcı gönül rahatlığı ile çalışırken aslında virüs bilgisayara zarar vermeye başlamıştır. Antivirüs ve antispyware\'ler işlevleri nedeniyle genellikle ayrı ayrı bulunan ve ayrı ayrı yüklenmesi gereken programlardır. Genellikle para ile satılırlar ve lisanslanmaları gerekir. Piyasada sıklıkla popüler antivirüs programlarının \\"kırılmış\\" halleri de bulunabilir. Ancak bunların içine \\"kırılma\\" sırasında kasıtlı casus programların konmadığı kimse tarafından garanti edilemeyeceği gibi, yeni çıkan virüslere karşı güncelleme yapmak gerektiği zaman bağltantı kurdukları üretici firmalar bunların korsan olduğunu anlar ve güncelleme yaptırmayı reddedebilirler. Son zamanlarda antivirüs, antispyware ve hatta kişisel firewall\'un bir arada paketlendiği programlar da piyasada görülmeye başlanmıştır. Ancak bunların fiyatları ve sistemde işgal edecekleri bellek ve iş gücü miktarı da o oranda artmaktadır. Bazı tanınmış antispyware programları ise tanıtım amacıyla çıkardıkları parasız versiyonlarında anlık kontrol yapmak yerine kullanıcı istediği zaman mevcut diski tarama şeklinde çalışırlar. Bunların en popüler olanlarından biri Ad-Aware\'dir. Bunun yanında Internet üzerinden bilgisayarınıza bağlanıp uzaktan tarama yapan siteler de vardır. Bunların bilgisayarınıza erişimi için kullanıcı bazı izinler verir ve belki küçük bazı programlar yükler. Bu, kullanıcı için büyük bir güvenlik açığı yaratmasının yanısıra, son derece yavaş ve kurumsal Internet trafiğini de olumsuz yönde etkileyebilecek bir yöntemdir; tarafımızdan önerilmez. Problemin daha da karmaşık olan yanı, Internet\'te sıklıkla bulunabilen bir çok antivirüs ve antispyware yazılımının bir kısmının da aslında bizzat virüs ve casus yazılım olmalarıdır. Bunlar normal kullanıcıya sanki onu koruyormuş gibi görünüp (ki aslında bazı zararlılardan gerçekten de koruyor olabilirler) bir yandan da casusluk yapan yazılımlardır. Hatta bunlar çok şatafatlı Web siteleri ile reklamlarını yapıyor da olabilirler. Kişilerin iyi araştırma yapmadan, bilenlere danışmadan bu tür programları yüklememeleri gerekir. Üniversitemizde, özellikle Beytepe Kampüsü\'nde arkadaş tavsiyesi ile yayılan bu tür bazı antivirüs yazılımları ile karşılaşılmıştır. Bu yazılımların yüklü olduğu bilgisayarlar, kullananlar farkında olmadan, zaman zaman Internet trafiğinde ciddi karmaşalara da sebep olmuşlardır. Bilgisayarımı Virüs ve Casus Yazılımlardan Nasıl Korurum? Çok geniş kapsamlı olan bu konuda burada ancak pratik bazı öneriler vermekle yetinilecektir. Burada genellikle Microsoft Windows işletim sistemlerini kullanan kullanıcılar hedeflenmiştir. Bunun nedeni bu işletim sisteminin diğerleri ile karşılaştırıldığında çok daha büyük oranda kullanıcı kitlesine sahip olması ve işletim sisteminde bulunan açıkların diğerlerinden daha çok bulunması ve kötüye kullanılmasıdır. Kuşkusuz ki burada anlatılanlar Linux, MacOS vb. işletim sistemlerini kullanan kullanıcılara da genel fikirler verecektir. Temel olarak virüs ve casus yazılımlardan korunmanın yolları şöyle sıralanabilir: Dışarıdan kaynağı belirsiz programları indirmemek, açmamak. Belki oldukça kısıtlayıcı bir durum olarak görünse de günümüz Internet ortamında ne yazık ki eskisine göre çok daha \\"paranoyak\\" davranmak zorundayız. \\"Cici\\" ekran koruyucular, bedava oyunlar, şifre kırma programları potansiyel birer virüs veya casus yazılım kaynağı olabilirler. Özellikle kaçak programlar ya da yazılım anahtarları bulmak için kullanılan \\"hack/crack\\" siteleri ideal mekanlardır. Bunların bir çoğu bir anahtar verebilmek için bile bir şeylerin tıklanmasını, birşeylere \\"yes\\" denmesini isterler. Bu ise aslında kişinin kendi elleriyle bilgisayarına zararlı yazılımları kurmasından başka birşey değildir. Bunlardan kesinlikle uzak durulması gerekir. Internet üzerinde bilinen, güvenlirliği kanıtlanmış, kaçak yazılım yükletmeyen freeware/shareware siteleri çok daha güvenlidir. Güvensiz e-postaları asla açmamak, içindeki eklentileri (attachment) çalıştırmamak. Bazen çok güvenilir bir kişiden bile, ya o da farkında olmadan, ya da onun adıyla, gelen e-postalar potansiyel virüs taşıyıcısı olabilirler. Özellikle Word dokümanı olan \\".doc\\" uzantılı dosyalar potansiyel virüs içerebilirler. Bazı e-posta istemcileri de (Outlook gibi), yazılımlarındaki açık ve hatalardan ötürü kullanıcı istemeden gelen e-postayı kendi kendilerine açıp çalıştırabilmektedirler. Bunların ayarlarının yapılmasında, kullanıcının isteği olmadan birşeyleri çalıştıran e-posta yazılımlarından uzak durulmasında yarar vardır. Bazen virüslü dosyaları e-posta ile yollayanlar, bunların uzantılarını kullanıcıları kandıracak biçimde gizleyebilirler. Örneğin, mp3 dosyası gibi zararsız bir dosya uzantısı varmış gibi gösterilen bir zararlı dosyanın asıl soneki mp3\'den sonra 100 adet boşluk ve \\".exe\\" olabilir ve bazı e-posta istemcileri bu boşlukları gösteremedikleri için kullanıcılar bu dosyayı mp3 dosyası sanıp tıklayabilirler. Eklentiler konusunda en iyi davranış, onları açmadan bir yere kaydetmek, uzantısından emin olmak ve özellikle \\"doc\\" dosyası ise, örneğin \\"Windows Wordpad\\" vb. başka daha ilkel bir programla açıp içini iyi-kötü görmeye çalışmak olabilir. Lisanslı işletim sistemleri ve yazılımlar kullanmak. Özellikle Windows işletim sistemlerinin lisanslı olarak elde edilip kurulmasında büyük yarar vardır. Lisanssız işletim sistemlerini kullananlar, bunlar için çıkarılan ve yazılım hatalarına karşı yapılan güncellemelerden çoğu zaman yararlanamazlar. Ayrıca \\"crack\\" olarak elde edilmiş bu yazılımların içine, \\"cracker\\" tarafından istenmeyen kodların yerleştirilmediğinden de emin olmak zordur. Lisanslı işletim sistemlerinde kullanıcılar \\"antispyware\\" gibi ek yazılımları da yükleyip kullanamazlar. Bu kural işletim sistemlerinin yanında Office gibi diğer sonradan yüklenen yazılımlar için de geçerlidir. Hacettepe Üniversitesi Bilgi İşlem Dairesi, kullanıcıların yazılımları lisanslı olarak kullanabilmeleri için gerekli anlaşmaları ve yazılım teminini yapmıştır. Antivirüs ve Antispyware kullanmak. Ancak bunların yasal olanlarını temin etmek ve kurmak önemlidir. Kullanıcılarda çok gözlemlenen bir davranış biçimine de dikkat çekmek gerekir: Kullanıcılar, \\"nasıl olsa antivirüs kullanıyorum\\" deyip, bilgisayar kullanımında daha özensizleşmektedirler. Zararlı bir program varsa nasıl olsa antivirüs\'ün bunu durduracağını düşünen kullanıcılar, aslında antivirüs\'lerin yüzde yüz bir koruma yapamadığını ve hatta çoğu zaman yeni yayılan virüsleri bulamadığını göz ardı eder ve virüs kaptıklarının farkına da çoğu zaman çok geç varırlar. Kullanıcıların bu hataya düşmemeleri gerekir. Piyasada ve Internet dünyasında çeşit çeşit antivirüs ve antispyware yazılımı mevcuttur. Kural, \\"en popüleri en iyisidir\\" değildir. Bir antivirüs programı ne kadar yaygınsa, onun açıkları, zaafları da o derece iyi biliniyor anlamına gelir ve bu da virüs yazarlarının işini kolaylaştırır. Diğer yandan hiç adı sanı duyulmamış bir antivirüs yazılımı şüpheli olabilir, güncelleme sıklığı yetersiz olabilir ya da teknolojisi daha iyi olan meşhur programlara göre bilgisayarınızı daha da yavaşlatabilirler. Ne yazık ki serbest piyasa ortamında birbirlerine karşı avantaj ve dezavantajları bulunan bu yazılımlardan birini diğerine karşı önermek de oldukça zordur. Bu yazının yazıldığı tarih itibarıyla lisanslı Windows XP kullanıcıları, Microsoft firmasının Web sitesinden \\"Windows Defender (beta)\\" adlı yazılımı ücretsiz olarak yükleyip çalıştırabilirler. Bu bir \\"antispyware\\" yazılımıdır ve oldukça etkin olarak çalışabilmektedir. Yine kısa bir süre sonra \\"Microsoft OneCare\\" adında bir antivirüs/antispyware/firewall paketi ABD dışındaki kullanıcılara sunulacaktır. Ayrıca satılan bu paket için de Hacettepe Üniversitesi Bilgi İşlem Dairesi gerekli anlaşmaları yapmak için beklemektedir. Şu anda paketin \\"beta\\" versiyonu yüklenip denenebilmektedir. Kişisel firewall kullanmak. Yukarıda firewall başlığı altında da değinildiği üzere bu konuda da farklı seçenekler vardır. En azından kullanıcının Windows XP\'sine Service Pack 2\'yi yüklemesi (bazı işletim sistemleri zaten yüklü gelmektedir) ve üzerinde hazır bulunan firewall\'u etkin hale getirmesi gerekir. Özel uygulamalar çalıştırmayan bir kullanıcının bu etkinleştirmeyi yaparken \\"don\'t allow exceptions (istisnalara izin verme)\\" benzeri seçeneği işaretlemesinde büyük yarar vardır. Kullanıcıların kullanım sırasında zaman zaman Windows firewall ayarlarının yapıldığı yere girip, herhangi bir programın mevcut ayarları değiştirip değiştirmediğine ve yeni açıklara izin verdirip verdirmediğine bakması yararlı bir davranış olacaktır. Zira bazı casus programlar bir kez bilgisayara girince mevcut firewall\'un bazı ayarlarıyla oynar ve dışarıdan normalde izin verilmeyen giriş portlarına sistemin izin vermesini sağlayabilir. Mümkün olduğunca şüpheli Web sitelerini ziyaret etmemek. Windows\'da bulunan bazı açıklardan yararlanan web sitesi yöneticileri, kullanıcının bu siteleri ziyaret etmesi durumunda casus yazılımları kapabilmesine neden olan bazı kodlar kullanabilmektedirler.

Here\'s the distinction: 1. **Bicuspid Valve (Mitral Valve):** The bicuspid valve, also known as the mitral valve, is one of the four main valves in the heart. It is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. As its name (\\"bi-\\" meaning \\"two\\") suggests, it typically has two cusps or leaflets. Its primary role is to prevent backflow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium when the ventricle contracts. 2. **Aortic Valve:** The aortic valve is another one of the heart\'s four valves, situated between the left ventricle and the aorta, which is the largest artery in the body. This valve opens to allow oxygen-rich blood to flow from the left ventricle into the aorta and hence to the rest of the body. The aortic valve typically has three cusps (making it tricuspid), although in some individuals, it can be bicuspid due to a congenital condition known as a bicuspid aortic valve. The confusion may arise because of the term \\"bicuspid\\" being associated with both the bicuspid (mitral) valve and a congenital variant of the aortic valve when it has two, instead of the usual three, cusps or leaflets. However, in standard anatomical terms, they refer to two distinct valves serving different functions within the cardiac cycle."},{"prompt":"What\'s bicuspid aortic valve","completion":"A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect where the aortic valve has only two leaflets (or cusps) instead of the usual three. This condition can lead to varying degrees of aortic valve dysfunction. The aortic valve plays a crucial role in the heart\'s blood flow, sitting between the left ventricle and the aorta. It opens to allow oxygen-rich blood to leave the heart and enter the aorta, from where it is distributed to the rest of the body. When the valve closes, it prevents blood from flowing back into the heart. In individuals with BAV, the altered valve architecture can lead to complications, such as: - **Aortic Stenosis:** The valve does not open fully, which restricts blood flow from the heart to the aorta and beyond. - **Aortic Regurgitation:** The valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the heart. - **Aortic Dilatation:** Enlargement of the aorta, which can increase the risk of aortic dissection or rupture over time. People with a bicuspid aortic valve may not experience symptoms for many years. However, the condition can be detected through imaging tests such as echocardiography, which is often how asymptomatic individuals learn they have BAV. Treatment depends on the severity of the valve dysfunction and associated conditions and can range from regular monitoring to medication or surgical interventions, including valve repair or replacement. Being a congenital condition, BAV is present at birth. It is one of the most common congenital heart defects but might not manifest or become problematic until adulthood. Prompt diagnosis and regular monitoring are important to manage the condition effectively and reduce the risk of complications."},{"prompt":"i had made a youtube shorts make catchy youtube shorts title (atleast 2 strong # in title), description (use atleast 10 strong # in description) and keywords (separated by comma in para form) to make it very strong contender of going viral on youtube and more strong on search engine and transcription of shorts is \\"🙏 The 4 Keys to a Happy Life: Sukh, Shanti, Seva, Sehat The video transcript discusses the four key elements of prayer: happiness, peace, service, and health.

However, for individuals with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation or those who are not candidates for surgery due to high risks or other health issues, managing the condition and improving heart health through non-surgical interventions can be a beneficial approach. Here’s how you can aim to manage or improve mitral valve regurgitation non-surgically: # 1. Medications While medications cannot cure mitral valve regurgitation, they can alleviate symptoms and decrease the heart’s workload. Commonly prescribed medications include: - **Diuretics**: Help reduce fluid accumulation in the body, easing symptoms like swelling and shortness of breath. - **Blood pressure medications**: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs can help manage high blood pressure, reducing strain on the heart. - **Anticoagulants**: In some cases, especially if atrial fibrillation (a common complication) is present, anticoagulants might be used to reduce the risk of blood clots. # 2. Lifestyle Modifications Adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle is critical for managing mitral valve regurgitation effectively: - **Diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol. - **Salt intake**: Reduce salt intake to help control blood pressure and prevent fluid buildup. - **Weight management**: Maintain a healthy weight to reduce the strain on your heart. - **Exercise**: Regular, moderate exercise can help strengthen the heart and improve cardiovascular health. However, it’s important to discuss with your healthcare provider to tailor a safe exercise plan for your condition. - **Alcohol and smoking**: Limit alcohol intake and avoid smoking, as these can exacerbate heart problems. # 3. Monitoring and Regular Check-ups Regular follow-up with your healthcare provider is important to monitor the progression of mitral valve regurgitation and adjust treatment as needed. This might include routine echocardiograms to assess the valve’s condition and the heart\'s function. # 4. Management of Comorbidities Effectively managing other conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol is crucial as these can contribute to worsening heart health. # Future and Emerging Treatments - **Transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR)**: Though technically a minimally invasive surgical procedure, this method is worth mentioning as it becomes increasingly available and is less invasive than traditional surgery. It might be suitable for some patients ineligible for conventional surgery. # Conclusion Improving mitral valve regurgitation through non-surgical interventions involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring. It\'s important to work closely with your healthcare team, including cardiologists and primary care providers, to tailor a comprehensive approach based on your health status, severity of the regurgitation, and overall goals of care. Always consult healthcare professionals for advice tailored to your specific situation."},{"prompt":"Does the condition cause systolic blood pressure","completion":"Mitral valve regurgitation typically affects the heart\'s ability to pump efficiently rather than directly influencing the blood pressure in the manner that conditions like aortic stenosis might. However, its effects on the heart and the circulatory system can indirectly influence blood pressure readings, including systolic blood pressure, over time. Understanding this requires a grasp of the condition\'s impact on heart dynamics: # Mitral Valve Regurgitation and Heart Function: - **Backflow of Blood**: In mitral valve regurgitation, the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the left atrium from the left ventricle when it contracts. This backflow means less blood is pumped out to the body with each heartbeat, which can lead to compensatory mechanisms by the heart and body. - **Compensatory Mechanisms**: The heart may initially respond by enlarging (dilating) and increasing the muscle mass (hypertrophy) to pump more effectively against the volume overload. These changes help maintain cardiac output but can alter long-term heart function and efficiency. # Impact on Systolic Blood Pressure: - **Variable Effects**: The immediate effect of mitral valve regurgitation on systolic blood pressure is not straightforward. In some individuals, systolic pressure may remain within normal ranges, especially in mild to moderate cases or when the condition has been well compensated. However, severe and long-standing mitral regurgitation can lead to changes in heart function that may eventually influence blood pressure. - **Potential for Decreased Blood Pressure**: Over time, the heart\'s ability to pump effectively can be compromised, possibly leading to lower systolic blood pressure due to the reduced ejection of blood with each heartbeat. Conversely, in the attempt to maintain adequate cardiac output, the heart rate may increase, and peripheral blood vessels may constrict, potentially maintaining or elevating systolic pressure for some time. # Complications and Considerations: - It\'s important to note that mitral regurgitation can lead to congestive heart failure, a condition that can have a complex relationship with blood pressure. Patients with heart failure might experience low blood pressure (including systolic), especially as heart function worsens. - Patients with mitral valve regurgitation may also have other co-existing conditions (like hypertension) that independently affect blood pressure, complicating the picture. # Conclusion: Mitral valve regurgitation primarily affects the heart\'s efficiency and volume dynamics rather than directly causing changes in systolic blood pressure. However, its long-term impact on the heart can indirectly influence blood pressure levels, potentially leading to both increases or decreases in systolic pressure depending on the individual\'s compensatory mechanisms and overall cardiovascular health. Managing blood pressure and mitigating heart strain through lifestyle changes and medication, as guided by a healthcare provider, are important strategies for patients with mitral valve regurgitation."},{"prompt":"What cardiovascular conditions are mostly likely to cause decreased blood pressure especially diastolic blood pressure? Please list them in the order of the likelihood. And please go into details of how such condition can lead to decreased blood pressure especially diastolic blood pressure.","completion":"Decreased blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure, can be a symptom or consequence of various cardiovascular conditions. Here\'s a list ordered by their general likelihood to cause specifically decreased diastolic blood pressure, along with explanations for how they lead to this condition: 1. **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)** - In HFrEF, the heart\'s ability to pump blood is diminished due to weakened heart muscles, typically affecting systolic function. This weakness leads to a decreased stroke volume, which can lower systolic blood pressure. The relationship to diastolic blood pressure is more complex but relates to the overall reduced cardiac output and potential for systemic vasodilation in response to poor perfusion. Over time, pressures can become low during diastole as well. 2. **Advanced Aortic Regurgitation** - Aortic regurgitation involves the backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. This backflow increases the volume of blood the left ventricle must handle, initially leading to increased stroke volume and potentially normal or elevated systolic pressure. However, the chronic volume overload can lead to dilation and ventricular dysfunction, and over time, the sustained high volume return in diastole can lead to lower diastolic pressures due to the rapid filling and decreased vascular resistance. 3. **Bradycardia (including Heart Block)** - In cases of significant bradycardia or heart block, where the heart rate is abnormally slow or the electrical impulse is delayed significantly, the decreased heart rate extends diastole. While this doesn\'t directly lower diastolic blood pressure in the straightforward way one might think, prolonged diastole can lead to increased filling times and potentially a mismatch in cardiac output versus systemic needs, indirectly influencing blood pressure maintenance and leading to lower overall blood pressure readings. 4. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Vasovagal syncope is a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to fainting, often in response to a trigger like sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. It involves increased parasympathetic stimulation and decreased sympathetic tone, causing vasodilation and bradycardia. While the acute drop is mostly noted in systolic blood pressure, diastolic pressure can also decrease as part of the overall lowered blood pressure. 5. **Cardiogenic Shock** - In cardiogenic shock, the heart suddenly can\'t pump enough blood to meet the body\'s needs due to a severe heart attack or other acute problems. The drastic reduction in cardiac output leads to lower systolic and diastolic pressures. The failure to maintain adequate stroke volume and pressure can critically lower diastolic pressure, as reduced perfusion leads to systemic vasodilation in an attempt to maintain blood flow, complicating the blood pressure profile. 6. **Severe Dehydration or Blood Loss** - While not solely a \\"cardiovascular\\" condition, severe dehydration or acute significant blood loss affects blood volume, which in turn has a direct impact on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Decreased blood volume means less blood returning to the heart (reduced preload), leading to decreased cardiac output and thereby decreasing both systolic and diastolic pressures. In summary, many conditions that lower diastolic blood pressure do so through mechanisms that either directly reduce the volume of blood within the cardiovascular system, impair the heart\'s ability to effectively pump blood, introduce inefficiencies in the heart\'s filling and contraction cycles, or cause systemic changes in vascular resistance. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for targeted treatments and interventions in managing low blood pressure conditions."},{"prompt":"Can all of the above conditions be observed in heart ultrasound","completion":"Yes, heart ultrasounds, also known as echocardiograms, can be instrumental in observing and diagnosing the conditions mentioned. An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create images of the heart, allowing clinicians to see the heart beating and pumping blood, providing valuable information about the size, shape, and movement of the heart muscle, valves, and chambers. Here\'s how each condition can be observed or inferred through an echocardiogram: 1. **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)** - Echocardiograms can directly measure the ejection fraction, which is a key indicator of systolic function. Low ejection fraction (typically <40%) indicates HFrEF. The echocardiogram can also show dilatation of cardiac chambers and other structural changes associated with heart failure. 2. **Advanced Aortic Regurgitation** - Echocardiograms can visualize the backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole, providing a direct observation of aortic regurgitation. The severity can be assessed based on the amount of regurgitant flow and its impact on left ventricular size and function. 3. **Bradycardia (including Heart Block)** - While an EKG (electrocardiogram) is the primary tool for diagnosing bradycardia and heart block, an echocardiogram can be used to assess the impact of these conditions on heart function. For example, it can show the effects of prolonged bradycardia on heart chamber sizes and wall motion. 4. **Vasovagal Syncope** - Direct observation of vasovagal syncope during an echocardiogram is unlikely, as it is a transient condition often triggered by specific stressors. However, echocardiography can help rule out structural heart disease as a cause for syncope. 5. **Cardiogenic Shock** - An echocardiogram can identify the underlying cardiac dysfunction leading to cardiogenic shock. This might include severe global hypokinesis indicating diffuse myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, or other structural abnormalities impairing the heart’s pumping ability. 6. **Severe Dehydration or Blood Loss** - While dehydration and blood loss are not directly observed through echocardiography, the effects on the heart, such as a reduced preload leading to decreased chamber sizes and potentially hyperdynamic cardiac motion due to low blood volume, can be inferred. An echocardiogram provides a lot of valuable information regarding heart function and structural integrity, making it a crucial diagnostic tool in the management of many cardiovascular conditions. However, it is often used alongside other diagnostic methods, such as physical examination, EKG, blood tests, and patient history, to fully understand a patient\'s cardiovascular health."},{"prompt":"Patient has a history of high blood pressure. Colour Doppler echocardiography shows mild Tricuspid Valve regurgitation and biscuspid regurgitation. Patient also has sinus bradycardia. Their blood pressure now seem low e.g. Less than 100/60 sometimes and most of the time is less than 110/70. Why is that?","completion":"A patient with a history of high blood pressure who now presents with low blood pressure readings, as well as mild tricuspid valve regurgitation, bicuspid valve regurgitation (presumably aortic or mitral valve, as \\"bicuspid regurgitation\\" would need specification), and sinus bradycardia, has a complex cardiovascular profile. Understanding the drop in blood pressure in such a patient involves examining the interplay of these conditions and their management. Here’s an integrated look at potential reasons for the observed lower blood pressure: # 1. **Impact of Valve Regurgitations** - **Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation**: Although generally mild tricuspid regurgitation might not significantly impact systemic blood pressure, in some cases, it can reflect or contribute to changes in right heart function and pulmonary pressures, affecting overall cardiac output. - **Bicuspid Valve Regurgitation**: If this refers to regurgitation in a bicuspid aortic valve, it could lead to a reduction in effective forward blood flow over time, influencing systemic arterial pressures. The inability of the valve to close properly allows blood to flow backward, reducing the net forward flow, which might contribute to lower blood pressure readings. # 2. **Sinus Bradycardia** - Sinus bradycardia, defined as a resting heart rate below 60 beats per minute, can lead to reduced cardiac output if the heart rate is too slow to maintain adequate blood flow, especially if this condition is pronounced. Reduced cardiac output can lower systemic blood pressure. However, in well-conditioned individuals or those with certain medical conditions, sinus bradycardia may not dramatically affect blood pressure unless it\'s significantly slow or accompanied by other cardiovascular impairments. # 3. **Management of High Blood Pressure** - The treatment regimen for the pre-existing high blood pressure might have been effective or possibly overtreated, leading to lower blood pressure readings. Medications such as beta-blockers, which are often used for high blood pressure and can also control heart rate, could contribute to both the observed sinus bradycardia and lower blood pressure. Adjustments in medication dosage or type might be necessary. # 4. **Compensatory Mechanisms and Cardiovascular Adaptations** - The body’s compensatory mechanisms in response to valve regurgitations and bradycardia might have undergone changes over time. For example, adjustments in vascular resistance and heart chamber adaptations to maintain efficient blood flow can alter blood pressure patterns. # 5. **Other Contributing Factors** - Dehydration, changes in medication, weight loss, and lifestyle modifications, or the presence of other underlying conditions not identified through an echocardiogram could also play a role in lowered blood pressure readings. # Conclusion In patients with a complex interplay of cardiovascular conditions like this, it\'s crucial to approach management holistically. A thorough review of the current treatment regimen, including medication types and dosages, should be considered, alongside continuous monitoring of symptoms and blood pressure changes. In some cases, adjusting medications or implementing lifestyle modifications can help manage low blood pressure. Close follow-up with a healthcare provider, preferably one specializing in cardiology, is essential for tailored management and ensuring the patient\'s cardiovascular health is optimally supported."},{"prompt":"When I said Bicupid valve, it was referring to pulmonary valve I believe. Correct me if I\'m wrong.","completion":"The term \\"bicuspid\\" typically refers to a valve normally having two leaflets or cusps. In the context of the heart\'s anatomy, the term is most commonly used to describe the aortic valve when it has congenitally developed with only two cusps instead of the usual three, a condition known as a bicuspid aortic valve. This is a common congenital heart defect. The pulmonary valve, like the aortic valve, is normally tricuspid, meaning it has three cusps. It does not commonly present as bicuspid, and when variations occur, they are often in other forms such as dysplasia or stenosis. Therefore, referring to a \\"bicuspid pulmonary valve\\" would be unusual and might be a misunderstanding. In your mention, there seems to have been a mix-up. If the discussion was meant to focus on abnormalities with the pulmonary valve, and you used the term \\"bicuspid,\\" it might have been a misnomer or confusion with the terminology. It’s important to clarify the specifics of the valve condition: - If discussing a condition that inherently involves having two cusps in a valve where it\'s not typical, the aortic valve is the most fitting context for the term \\"bicuspid.\\" - If the pulmonary valve has an abnormality, the correct term might be related to its specific condition — such as pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, or pulmonary valve dysplasia — rather than \\"bicuspid.\\" The pulmonary valve controls blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery and towards the lungs. Abnormalities in the pulmonary valve, such as regurgitation or stenosis, can impact right ventricular function and pulmonary circulation but would not directly be referred to as \\"bicuspid\\" in the standard usage of cardiac anomaly terminology. Clarification and accurate diagnostics are important for appropriate management and understanding of any valve abnormality\'s implications on cardiac function and overall health. An echocardiogram would indeed identify abnormalities in valve structure and function, regardless of which valve is involved."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Assigning an \\"unhealthy\\" label to specific personality types, systems, or categories can be highly stigmatizing and misleading. Every personality framework mentioned—MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator), Enneagram, the Four Temperaments, Big Five, Socionics, Instinctual Variants, Hogwarts Houses, and D&D Moral Alignments—was developed to describe human behavior, preferences, or potential, not to pathologize or judge them as inherently \\"healthy\\" or \\"unhealthy.\\" However, each of these systems can describe tendencies that might lead to unhealthy behaviors when taken to an extreme or present in an unbalanced manner. It is critical to highlight that any personality type can exhibit unhealthy traits, and the manifestation of such traits often results from a complex interaction between an individual\'s personality, their environment, and their coping mechanisms rather than the personality typology itself. 1. **MBTI**: Each of the 16 MBTI types can display unhealthy behaviors when under stress or if their dominant traits are overemphasized to the detriment of their other traits. For example, an INTP might become detached and overly critical, whilst an ESFJ might become overly controlling and sensitive to criticism. It\'s the balance and development across all cognitive functions that contribute to healthier behaviors. 2. **Enneagram**: The Enneagram specifically addresses the concept of levels of health within each type, ranging from healthy to unhealthy levels. Each of the 9 types can exhibit unhealthy behaviors when functioning at an unhealthy level. For instance, Type 2 might become manipulative, and Type 8 might become domineering. 3. **Four Temperaments**: Similar to other typologies, each temperament can lead to unhealthy behaviors if not balanced with the qualities of the other temperaments. For instance, a Choleric individual might become overly aggressive or hostile. 4. **Big Five**: Unhealthy behaviors may be linked more directly to extreme scores on the Big Five aspects. For example, very high Neuroticism might lead to anxiety and mood swings, while extremely low Agreeableness might result in antisocial behavior. 5. **Socionics**: Like MBTI, Socionics doesn\'t inherently associate with unhealthy behaviors, but certain imbalances in Socionic relations or within an individual\'s function stack could lead to dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics. 6. **Instinctual Variants**: The overdominance of any one instinctual variant (Self-Preservation, Social, or Sexual) can lead to imbalanced behaviors. For instance, an excess in Self-Preservation might manifest as selfishness or extreme risk aversion. 7. **Hogwarts Houses**: Each House values different traits, and an \'unhealthy\' member might take those traits to the extreme. For example, an overly ambitious Slytherin might resort to unethical behavior to achieve their ends. 8. **Moral Alignment**: Concepts like \\"Lawful Evil\\" or \\"Chaotic Neutral\\" from D&D can be associated with behaviors often perceived as unethical or self-serving, but it\'s essential to note that these alignments are more often used for character development in storytelling rather than as psychological assessments. In conclusion, labeling personality types or traits as \\"unhealthy\\" perpetuates a misunderstanding of psychological typologies and individual differences. It\'s healthier to focus on personal growth, balance, and adaptive coping mechanisms for all types, recognizing that everyone has the potential for both constructive and destructive behaviors depending on a multitude of factors."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let\'s break down what these traits might mean when combined, especially considering the notion of being \\"unhealthiest,\\" which could reflect a state where the negative aspects of these traits are exaggerated or dominate. # MBTI: INTJ INTJs are known for being strategic, analytical, and highly independent. In an unhealthy state, they might become overly critical, dismissive of others\' emotions, and prone to overthinking, leading to paralysis by analysis. # Enneagram: 8w9 Unhealthy Enneagram 8s can be domineering, confrontational, and insensitive to others\' feelings or viewpoints. The 9 wing may slightly buffer these traits with a desire for peace and stability, but under stress, this can result in internal conflict and a struggle between a desire for control and a wish for harmony. # Temperament: Choleric-Phlegmatic This blend suggests someone who is ambitious and leader-like (Choleric) yet calm and unemotional (Phlegmatic) under pressure. At their worst, this could manifest as a cold, detached demeanor, sometimes appearing impassive or dismissive towards others\' needs or emotions. # Big Five - **Low Extraversion**: Prefers solitude, which can lead to isolation if taken to an extreme. - **Very Low Neuroticism**: While generally mentally stable, they might be seen as uncaring or unempathetic. - **High Conscientiousness**: Detail-oriented and organized, but potentially rigid and inflexible. - **Low Agreeableness**: Could be interpreted as self-centered, competitive, and antagonistic in unhealthy stages. - **Very High Openness**: Creative and curious, yet might become overly engrossed in ideas rather than practical or social realities. # Socionics: SLI As an SLI, they are practical, self-sufficient, and prefer stability. However, unhealthy traits might include a pronounced stubbornness and a reluctance to leave their comfort zones, ignoring opportunities for growth or connection. # Instinctual Variant: sp/sx Focused primarily on self-preservation and intimate relationships. In a negative light, such a person might become overly concerned with their security to the detriment of social bonds or common goals. # Hogwarts House: Slytherin Ambition and resourcefulness are hallmarks of Slytherin. An unhealthy Slytherin might use cunning or manipulation to achieve their ends, showing little concern for the collateral damage to relationships or moral codes. # Moral Alignment: Chaotic Neutral This alignment suggests someone who values personal freedom above laws and others\' opinions. In unhealthy expressions, this could evolve into selfishness, recklessness, and an unpredictable or unprincipled nature. **In summary**, combining these traits - especially focusing on their most negative aspects - sketches a portrait of a person who is highly intelligent and creative but potentially isolated, inflexible, and insensitive. They might struggle with empathy and have difficulty maintaining relationships due to their domineering and detached nature. However, every trait has positive aspects, and personal growth often involves balancing these characteristics in healthier ways."},{"prompt":"make this paragraph into a more polite way: This is to endorse the concern of unit 51L-EW, there were an issues for the provision of guide wire in the conduit for the 2 units of air conditioning.

Personalities are complex and multifaceted, and how one\'s traits manifest can heavily depend on context, environment, and personal growth. That said, let\'s explore this combination of traits: **MBTI - INTJ**: Known as the Architect or Strategist, INTJs are analytical, ambitious, and highly independent. They approach problems logically and are driven to improve systems and processes. **Enneagram - 8w9**: This combination suggests a person who seeks control and autonomy (type 8) but also has elements of wanting peace and harmony (wing 9). This could manifest as a leader who is assertive but also seeks to maintain a level of calm and balance. **Temperament - Choleric-Phlegmatic**: A person with a dominant choleric temperament is goal-oriented, ambitious, and can be domineering. The phlegmatic influence adds a layer of calm, reliability, and efficiency but perhaps with a resistance to quick changes. **Big Five Personality Traits**: - **Low Extraversion**: Prefers solitude or small groups, may appear reserved. - **Very Low Neuroticism**: Highly stable, emotionally resilient, not easily stressed. - **High Conscientiousness**: Detail-oriented, reliable, and structured. - **Purely Low Agreeableness**: May be competitive, skeptical of others\' intentions, and not easily swayed by emotions. - **High Openness**: Creative, curious, and open to new ideas and experiences. **Socionics - LII** (INTj in Socionics): Aligns closely with the INTJ in MBTI. They are logical, independent thinkers who prioritize consistency and structure in their understanding of the world. **Instinctual Variant - sp/sx**: This suggests a person who is primarily focused on self-preservation (sp) including their health, safety, and comfort, followed by sexual (sx) instinct, which relates to one-on-one relationships and intense experiences, often leading to an intense inner life or close personal connections. **Hogwarts House - Slytherin**: Values ambition, cunning, leadership, and resourcefulness. Slytherins are known for their determination to achieve their goals, sometimes by any means necessary. **Moral Alignment - Neutral Evil**: Acts primarily out of self-interest without regard for the rules or well-being of others. They aren’t bound by any loyalty or tradition and often pursue power and self-advancement. Combining these elements, the person described is highly ambitious, independent, and goal-oriented, with a strategic mind and a focus on efficiency and self-preservation. Their low agreeableness and Neutral Evil alignment may make them more prone to prioritizing their desires over others, potentially using their intelligence and strategic thinking to manipulate situations to their advantage without much concern for ethical or moral standards. Their low neuroticism and high conscientiousness suggest that they are resilient and reliable but may struggle with empathy or flexibility in social situations. In terms of healthiness, the key areas for growth would involve developing empathy, considering the impact of their actions on others, and perhaps exploring the value of collaboration and emotional connections. Their strengths would undoubtedly include problem-solving, strategic planning, and the ability to maintain calm and focus under pressure. It\'s essential to approach this analysis with the understanding that individuals have the capacity to grow and that personality frameworks are tools for insight rather than definitive labels."},{"prompt":"Describe unhealthiest personality","completion":"Describing the \\"unhealthiest\\" personality involves identifying traits, behaviors, and patterns that could potentially lead to dysfunctional relationships with oneself and others, as well as impediments to personal and professional development. However, it\'s crucial to remember that the concept of \\"healthiness\\" in personality can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives. Moreover, traits that are maladaptive in one context may be beneficial in others. That said, here\'s a synthesis of characteristics and patterns that might be considered emblematic of an \\"unhealthiest\\" personality, drawing on a mix of psychological theories without targeting a specific framework: 1. **Extreme Narcissism**: A deeply ingrained sense of entitlement, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. This can lead to exploiting relationships and a failure to recognize others\' needs and feelings. 2. **High Neuroticism**: In the context of the Big Five personality traits, very high neuroticism can manifest as emotional instability, anxiety, moodiness, irritability, and a tendency toward depression. This could impair one\'s ability to cope with stress and make objective decisions. 3. **Aggressiveness & Hostility**: Regularly displaying unreasonable anger, irritability, or a propensity to blame others can disrupt relationships and lead to social isolation or confrontations. 4. **Impulsivity & Lack of Self-Control**: Acting on immediate desires without consideration for consequences. This can impact various life areas, including financial decisions, relationships, and health-related behaviors. 5. **Paranoia & Distrust**: A pervasive mistrust of others, assuming that others have malevolent intentions without sufficient basis. This can severely impact interpersonal relationships and lead to isolation. 6. **Rigidity in Thinking and Behavior**: Inability to adapt to change, stubbornness, and a lack of openness to new ideas. This can limit personal growth and lead to conflict in situations that require flexibility and compromise. 7. **Lack of Conscientiousness**: Low levels of self-discipline, aimlessness, and a tendency to neglect duties or responsibilities could result in underachievement and a failure to fulfill one\'s potential. 8. **Manipulative or Deceptive Behavior**: Engaging in deceit or manipulation for personal gain or to control others can lead to mistrust and unhealthy relationships. 9. **Lack of Empathy and Understanding**: Inability to recognize or share another person\'s feelings or experiences. This can hamper the development of close and supportive relationships. 10. **Avoidance of Personal Growth**: Refusal to acknowledge personal issues, learn from experiences, or engage in self-reflection. This stagnation can lead to repeated patterns of dysfunction in various life domains. It\'s vital to approach this topic with sensitivity and an understanding that personality disorders or traits that contribute to an \\"unhealthiest\\" personality are often the result of complex interactions between genetics, environment, and individual experiences. Moreover, individuals with unhealthy personality traits or disorders can seek help and make significant changes through therapy, medication, and personal effort. Personality is not static, and with support and intervention, people can work towards healthier patterns of thinking and behaving."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like you haven\'t asked a question yet.

The first row should ideally be the headers. Here\'s how the CSV representation of the provided JSON would look: ``` pagenumber,text 1,Hello world 2,JSON to CSV conversion ``` # Manual Conversion Steps 1. **Create Headers:** Your first row should have your headers. In this case, \\"pagenumber\\" and \\"text\\". 2. **Fill in Rows:** For each JSON object, you will create a new row in the CSV file where each property fills in the cell under its respective column, with the properties being separated by commas. 3. **Quoting and Commas in Text:** If your text contains commas, you\'ll need to wrap the entire text string in quotes to ensure it\'s interpreted correctly. For example, `1,\\"Hello, world\\"`. # Programmatically Conversion Examples Here\'s how you could convert it programmatically using Python for example: ```python import csv import json # Sample JSON string json_data = \'\'\' [ {\\"pagenumber\\": 1, \\"text\\": \\"Hello world\\"}, {\\"pagenumber\\": 2, \\"text\\": \\"JSON to CSV conversion\\"} ] \'\'\' # Parse JSON data data = json.loads(json_data) # Specify the CSV file name csv_file_name = \\"output.csv\\" # Open a file for writing with open(csv_file_name, mode=\'w\', newline=\'\', encoding=\'utf-8\') as file: # Create a CSV writer writer = csv.writer(file) # Write headers writer.writerow([\\"pagenumber\\", \\"text\\"]) # Write data for item in data: writer.writerow([item[\\"pagenumber\\"], item[\\"text\\"]]) ``` This Python script opens (and creates if it doesn\'t exist) a file named `output.csv`, writes the header based on our JSON keys, then iterates through the JSON array converting each object to a CSV row.

The current unfinished story: \\"She stood there, a solitary figure, in the vastness of an avocado plantation. The sun beat down relentlessly, burning the earth beneath her feet. Sweat dripped from her brow, blending with the dust kicked up by the hot breeze that fluttered through the leaves of the surrounding trees. Tears glistened in her eyes, threatening to spill over, but she blinked them away. Mom had told her she was the strongest girl she had ever known, and she couldn\'t let herself falter now. Threading through the rows of towering avocado trees, her small hands grazed against the rough textures of their trunks. Two bags, filled to the brim with the ripe fruit she had painstakingly plucked, left behind two parallel traces as she dragged them along.\\"","completion":"As she trudged deeper into the plantation, the girl couldn\'t shake off the nagging doubt that gnawed at her spirit. The daunting task ahead was met with both internal and external resistance. Her mission was clear, yet the path was fraught with challenges. The external obstacles became immediately apparent; the sheer physical distance to cover under the sweltering sun, the weight of the avocado bags dragging against her resolve, and the labyrinth of avocado trees that seemed to mock her with their similarity, making navigation a puzzler. Internally, her battles raged with equal fervor. The fear of failing her mission and disappointing her mother loomed over her like a shadow. Her mother’s words, while meant to empower, had also sown the seeds of doubt — was she truly strong enough to carry out this task? With every step, her confidence wavered, battling the urge to turn back. Her journey took a pivotal turn when she encountered an unexpected obstacle; a wide river that sliced through the plantation, its presence unbeknownst to her. The river was too wide to jump across, and the thought of returning empty-handed after coming so far was a blow she wasn\'t prepared to face. Tears of frustration brimmed in her eyes again, but this time, they fell freely. She felt defeated, her mission all but failed. However, the resilience instilled in her by her mother\'s belief sparked a determination to overcome. Wiping away her tears, she scanned her surroundings for a solution. It was then she spotted a narrow, somewhat unstable-looking bridge a few meters downriver, partially concealed by overhanging branches. Though apprehensive, the girl understood that this bridge represented more than just a physical crossing; it was the manifestation of overcoming the obstacles she faced internally and externally. With cautious steps and a firm grip on her precious cargo, she crossed the bridge. Each creak and sway tested her resolve, but she kept her mother\'s image in her mind, a beacon of strength guiding her forward. Reaching the other side, a sense of accomplishment surged through her. Not only had she overcome the physical barriers, but she had also conquered her internal fears and doubts. The final leg of her journey was no less challenging, but now she approached each difficulty with a newfound confidence. When she finally arrived at the doorstep of the family\'s modest home nestled deep within the plantation, the relief and pride that washed over her were immeasurable. The family\'s warm welcome and gratitude for the avocados she brought, a crucial ingredient for the feast they were preparing, was the ultimate reward. They shared stories of the plantation and the importance of community and support, reinforcing the lessons of strength and perseverance she learned along the way. As the girl made her way back home, the plantation no longer seemed like an insurmountable challenge but a witness to her resilience. She realized that strength wasn\'t just about completing a task but facing your fears and overcoming them. With the setting sun casting long shadows between the avocado trees, she smiled, knowing she had not only fulfilled her mission but had also grown stronger within herself. Her mother was right, after all."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Then the little girl remember there is a small house deep in the plantation thather father had built when it\'s avocado season. And she believe that if she reached the house, her father will be there waiting for her. The current unfinished story: “She stood there, a solitary figure, in the vastness of an avocado plantation. The sun beat down relentlessly, burning the earth beneath her feet. Sweat dripped from her brow, blending with the dust kicked up by the hot breeze that fluttered through the leaves of the surrounding trees. Tears glistened in her eyes, threatening to spill over, but she blinked them away. Mom had told her she was the strongest girl she had ever known, and she couldn’t let herself falter now. Threading through the rows of towering avocado trees, her small hands grazed against the rough textures of their trunks. Two bags, filled to the brim with the ripe fruit she had painstakingly plucked, left behind two parallel traces as she dragged them along.”","completion":"With each step, the little girl’s heart pounded with a blend of hope and fear. The trees seemed to whisper secrets as she passed, their leaves rustling with a sound that was both comforting and eerie. Her father\'s absence was a looming shadow, the vast plantation now a labyrinth that held him hidden from her. Internal conflict swirled within her, a storm of emotions. She was stricken with fear at the thought of never finding her way back to her father, of being forever lost among these endless trees. Yet, there was a flicker of hope, an ember that refused to be extinguished. She remembered her father’s words, spoken with a laugh as they had set out that morning, \\"If you ever get lost, just head to our little house. I\'ll find you there.\\" Those words were now her beacon. As she trudged on, the external obstacles became increasingly daunting. The sun was a merciless adversary, sapping her strength with its unforgiving heat. Thorns snagged at her clothes, and insects buzzed around her, drawn by the lingering scent of sweat and fear. Yet, it was not just the physical challenges that she had to overcome. The sense of isolation grew with every passing minute. The once familiar plantation had transformed into an alien landscape, each tree now seeming like a menacing giant watching her struggle. But the determination that her mother had praised was no idle compliment. With gritted teeth, she forged ahead, refusing to let despair take root. \\"I am the strongest girl,\\" she whispered to herself, a mantra against the overwhelming odds. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the outline of the small house emerged through the trees. It was a simple structure, built with rugged hands and love, a shelter during the long days of harvest. Its sight was like a lighthouse to a ship lost at sea. Tears of relief replaced those of fear, and she rushed forward, the last reserves of her energy propelling her towards safety. She burst through the door, half expecting, half hoping to see her father there. But the room was empty, the only sound her ragged breathing. Despair nipped at her heels, but before it could engulf her, she heard the sound of hurried footsteps outside. The door swung open, and there stood her father, his face etched with worry that melted into relief at the sight of her. \\"I told you I\'d find you here,\\" he said, his voice choked with emotion. The little girl ran into his open arms, the bags of avocados forgotten outside. The reunion was a bittersweet reminder of the day\'s ordeal, both aware of how easily it could have ended differently. But it also reinforced their bond, a testament to their resilience and love. They emerged from the experience stronger, with a newfound respect for the vastness and the dangers of the plantation. As they walked back home, hand in hand, the plantation no longer seemed an insurmountable obstacle. It was a part of their lives, a source of livelihood, and now a backdrop to their tale of survival and courage. The little girl had overcome her internal conflict of fear and self-doubt, just as they together had braved the external challenges of nature and separation. The resolution lay not just in their reunion but in the lessons learned and the strength gleaned from adversity. The story of that day would be retold many times, a reminder of the day the strongest girl her mother knew became even stronger."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This condition can be caused or exacerbated by several factors, including the electrolyte imbalances hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) and hypercalcemia (high calcium in the blood). # Hypokalemia and Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus 1. **Impairment of Aquaporin-2 Trafficking**: Potassium plays a significant role in intracellular processes, including the positioning of aquaporin-2 water channels in the kidney. Low potassium levels can disrupt the normal trafficking and insertion of these channels into the apical membrane of the collecting duct cells, impairing water reabsorption. 2. **Altered Renal Blood Flow**: Hypokalemia can decrease renal blood flow and affect the medullary concentration gradient that is vital for water reabsorption. A disturbed gradient reduces the kidney\'s ability to concentrate urine. 3. **Changes in Renal Cell Function**: Potassium is critical for normal cell function. Its deficiency can cause structural and functional changes in renal cells, affecting their ability to concentrate urine effectively. # Hypercalcemia and Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus 1. **Inhibition of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) Action**: High calcium levels can interfere with the action of ADH (also known as vasopressin) on the kidneys. Calcium can inhibit the response of the collecting ducts to ADH, preventing water reabsorption and leading to the production of dilute urine. 2. **Calcium\'s Effect on Renal Tubules**: Excessive calcium can cause damage or changes in the renal tubules, directly impairing the kidney\'s ability to concentrate urine. This damage can be difficult to reverse, even after calcium levels return to normal. 3. **Alterations in Kidney Function**: Persistent high levels of calcium can lead to calcification and kidney stones, which can also impair kidney function and exacerbate NDI symptoms over time. In summary, hypokalemia and hypercalcemia disrupt normal kidney function through different mechanisms, both leading to a reduced ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine. This contributes to the development or worsening of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Management of these electrolyte imbalances is crucial in treating or mitigating the symptoms of NDI."},{"prompt":"Why thiazide diuretics use in nephrogenic dm","completion":"The use of thiazide diuretics in managing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) may initially seem counterintuitive, as they are typically known to increase urine output, something that NDI patients already struggle with due to their inability to concentrate urine effectively. However, thiazide diuretics play a unique and valuable role in the treatment of NDI through several mechanisms: 1. **Volume Depletion and Compensation:** Thiazide diuretics reduce plasma and extracellular fluid volume, leading to a state of mild volume depletion. The body responds to this volume depletion by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the nephron. Because a larger proportion of the filtrate is reabsorbed early in the nephron, less reaches the distal parts of the nephron and collecting ducts, where the defect in water reabsorption in NDI is most pronounced. Essentially, less fluid reaches the segment of the kidney that is not functioning properly, reducing the volume of urine produced. 2. **Enhanced Proximal Sodium and Water Reabsorption:** By promoting sodium reabsorption in the proximal parts of the kidney, thiazide diuretics decrease the delivery of sodium to the distal nephron segments. This action indirectly facilitates an increase in water reabsorption in these early segments, further helping to concentrate the urine and reduce polyuria. 3. **Decreased Blood Pressure in the Glomerulus:** Thiazides also cause a modest decrease in blood pressure within the glomerulus (the part of the nephron where blood filtration begins). Lower glomerular blood pressure slightly reduces the rate of glomerular filtration, resulting in less filtrate formation and subsequent less urine formation. 4. **Alteration of Electrolyte Reabsorption:** Thiazide diuretics also affect the reabsorption of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium, which can have secondary effects on water reabsorption and urine concentration. It\'s important to note that managing NDI with thiazide diuretics often involves careful monitoring and may be done in conjunction with dietary sodium restriction and sometimes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to further reduce polyuria. The aim is to mitigate the symptoms of NDI, mainly by reducing the excessive urine output and thirst, thereby improving the patient\'s quality of life. Due to these mechanisms, thiazides, paradoxically, become effective in the management of a condition characterized by the inability to concentrate urine and excessive urine output. This therapeutic approach highlights the complexity of water and sodium homeostasis in the body and the innovative ways in which medications can be used to correct imbalances."},{"prompt":"Why pottssium sparing diuretics used here","completion":"Potassium-sparing diuretics are sometimes used in the treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), particularly when concomitant use of thiazide diuretics is implemented. Thiazide diuretics, while effective in reducing urine volume in NDI, tend to increase renal excretion of potassium, which can lead to hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood). Hypokalemia itself can worsen NDI for reasons previously discussed, including its detrimental effects on aquaporin-2 trafficking and overall renal function. Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and spironolactone, help prevent the loss of potassium that often accompanies the use of thiazide diuretics. Here\'s why they can be beneficial in the context of NDI treatment: 1. **Prevention of Hypokalemia**: By reducing the excretion of potassium in the urine, potassium-sparing diuretics help maintain normal potassium levels in the blood. This is vital because potassium is crucial for the normal function of cells, including those in the kidneys. Maintaining adequate potassium levels helps ensure that the renal concentrating mechanism, which is already compromised in NDI, is not further impaired. 2. **Direct Effects on the Distal Nephron**: Some potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride, can directly affect the distal nephron\'s function. Amiloride works by inhibiting sodium channels in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. This inhibition reduces the potential difference across the tubule, making it less favorable for potassium and hydrogen ion secretion and thus sparing potassium. Moreover, this action can help reduce urine volume somewhat independently of potassium-sparing effects. 3. **Combination Therapy for Enhanced Effect**: When used in conjunction with thiazide diuretics, potassium-sparing diuretics can allow for the effective reduction of urine volume (a desirable effect from thiazides in the management of NDI) while mitigating one of the significant side effects of thiazides, which is hypokalemia. This combination can be particularly effective in managing NDI as it addresses both the symptoms and one of the potential complications of the treatment. It\'s worth noting that while potassium-sparing diuretics can offer significant benefits when used appropriately, their use must be carefully monitored by healthcare professionals. The risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), especially in patients with impaired kidney function or those taking other medications that increase potassium levels, must be managed. Adjustments in dosage and regular monitoring of blood potassium levels are essential parts of therapy when using these diuretics, particularly in the context of treating conditions like NDI."},{"prompt":"klipper是什么？","completion":"Klipper是一个开源固件，专为3D打印机设计，目的是提高打印质量和速度。不同于传统的3D打印机固件如Marlin和Repetier，Klipper通过将打印机的运动计算从打印机的微控制器转移到一台更强大的主机计算机上来实现其性能提升。这种设计允许Klipper在实现更复杂的算法和更高打印速度的同时，保持对旧式硬件的兼容性。 Klipper通过一个简单的USB连接与3D打印机的微控制器相连，使用Python编写的软件在主机计算机上运行。这个设计让用户可以利用旧的或低性能的硬件实现出色的打印效果。通过这种方式，Klipper可以管理多个微控制器，为复杂的多挤出头设置或具有多个独立运动轴的打印机提供支持。 Klipper的配置通过一个简单的文本文件进行，这使得用户可以轻松地定制和调优打印机的设置。Klipper支持广泛的3D打印机和控制板，并且社区活跃，不断更新和改进固件。此外，Klipper也支持一些高级功能，如压力先行控制（pressure advance）、输入整形（input shaping）以减少振动，以及自动床平衡等，这些特性进一步提高了3D打印的精度和速度。"},{"prompt":"chrome如何规避unique fingerprint？","completion":"Chrome浏览器中规避独特的指纹（unique fingerprint）是指尽量减少在线跟踪您的网站活动时可识别您身份的信息量。指纹识别技术可以通过收集您的设备信息（如屏幕分辨率、操作系统、浏览器版本等）来识别和追踪您的网络活动，即使您更换了IP地址或是在隐私模式下浏览。以下是一些减少Chrome中被唯一识别风险的方法： 1. **使用隐身模式**：虽然隐身模式不能阻止网站收集您的浏览器指纹信息，但它可以在每次关闭浏览器时自动删除cookies和本地数据，减少跟踪的机会。 2. **禁用JavaScript**：许多指纹跟踪技术都依赖于JavaScript来收集数据。在某些情况下，禁用JavaScript可以限制这种跟踪，但这可能会影响您浏览网页的体验。 3. **使用浏览器扩展**：一些浏览器扩展如Privacy Badger，uBlock Origin等，可以帮助屏蔽或减少网站收集您的浏览数据。其中，有专门用于防范指纹识别的扩展，如CanvasBlocker，可以帮助掩盖或修改您的浏览器指纹信息。 4. **使用隐私保护较强的浏览器**：虽然这个建议不是特定于Chrome的，但是使用像Tor、Brave这样对用户隐私保护更为强大的浏览器，可以有效减少个人信息的泄漏。Tor浏览器特别适用于极力避免被指纹识别的情况。 5. **限制或调整浏览器设置**：调整Chrome的设置，例如禁用第三方cookies、启用“防跟踪请求”，以及经常更改浏览器的用户代理（User-Agent）等，都可在一定程度上降低被跟踪的风险。 6. **更新浏览器**：保持浏览器版本最新不仅能享受最新的功能，还可以确保获得最新的隐私保护措施和安全更新。 虽然以上方法可以在一定程度上降低被跟踪的风险，但没有任何一种方法能够完全防止被唯一指纹识别。在利用以上方法的同时，增加对个人隐私保护的意识，谨慎分享个人信息，对于保护个人隐私也至关重要。"},{"prompt":"klipper可否运行在x86主机？","completion":"是的，Klipper可以运行在x86架构的主机上。Klipper是通过主机端软件与3D打印机的微控制器进行通信来工作的，这意味着主机端软件可以安装在任何能运行其代码的系统上，包括x86架构的PC、笔记本电脑或服务器等。 运行在x86主机上对Klipper来说有几大优势： 1. **性能**：x86架构的计算性能通常远高于典型3D打印机使用的微控制器，这意味着Klipper可以更快速地处理复杂的运动计算和算法，从而可能提高打印速度和打印质量。 2. **易于安装和维护**：相对于微型计算设备（如Raspberry Pi），常规的x86 PC可能更容易为一些用户安装和维护，特别是那些对传统电脑硬件更为熟悉的用户。 3. **资源丰富**：在x86架构的主机上，通常资源（CPU、内存等）更为充裕，这可能使得运行Klipper及其附加服务（如OctoPrint等）更为流畅。 如果你想在x86架构的主机上安装Klipper，你需要确保主机操作系统能够支持Klipper。Klipper通常在Linux环境中运行，所以你需要在x86机器上安装Linux发行版（如Ubuntu、Debian等）。随后，你可以按照Klipper的官方安装指导来安装和配置Klipper软件。此外，由于Klipper需要与3D打印机的微控制器通信，你还需要确保x86主机与3D打印机的微控制器（例如通过USB）能够正确连接。"},{"prompt":"如何在redmi手机上安装debian？","completion":"在Redmi手机或任何安卓设备上安装Debian或任何其他Linux发行版并非原生支持的操作，但借助一些专门工具和应用，这个过程可以实现。需要注意的是，这些操作可能涉及到系统深层设置，可能对设备的保修和稳定性产生影响。如果决定继续操作，请确保事先备份所有重要数据。 下面是在Redmi手机上安装Debian的一种方法，通过使用`UserLAnd`应用。UserLAnd允许用户在Android设备上运行Linux操作系统，无需root权限。 # 使用UserLAnd安装Debian 1. **准备工作：** -

**无根容器运行**：Podman允许用户在没有root权限的情况下创建和管理容器，增强了系统的安全性。 - **Daemonless架构**：与Docker不同的是，Podman不依赖于守护进程（daemon）。每当启动或管理容器时，Podman都会直接与容器运行时进行交互，这减少了系统的复杂性和潜在的安全问题。 - **兼容Docker CLI**：Podman的命令行工具设计为与Docker的CLI兼容，这意味着，对于大多数Docker命令，你只需将`docker`命令替换为`podman`即可。 - **支持OCI标准**：Podman完全支持开放容器倡议（Open Container Initiative，OCI）定义的标准，包括容器镜像和运行时规格。这确保了与其他容器工具和生态系统的良好兼容性。 - **Pod概念**：Podman引入了Pod的概念，允许用户管理一组共享网络命名空间、存储空间等资源的容器，这与Kubernetes中的Pod类似，便于在开发和测试中模拟Kubernetes环境。 # 使用场景： - **开发者**：可以使用Podman来开发、构建、测试和部署容器化应用。 - **系统管理员和DevOps专家**：可以利用Podman的无根特性和Daemonless模式，在提高安全性的同时进行容器管理和自动化运维。 - **CI/CD流水线**：由于Podman与Docker高度兼容，可以轻松地将其集成到现有的CI/CD流水线中，用于构建和部署容器化应用。 总的来说，Podman通过提供无根运行模式和摒弃守护进程架构，提供了一个安全、高效、与Docker兼容的容器管理解决方案。"},{"prompt":"LXC和LXD有什么区别？","completion":"LXC（Linux容器）和LXD（LXC的守护进程）都是容器技术，它们让用户可以在Linux系统上运行轻量级的虚拟环境。虽然两者在名称上非常相似，并且都与容器相关，但它们在设计、目的和功能上有明显的不同。 # LXC LXC是Linux容器技术的前身，它利用Linux内核的cgroup和命名空间功能来运行轻量级的隔离环境，这些环境看起来和感觉就像是独立的Linux系统。LXC专注于提供操作系统级的虚拟化。它允许用户在单个物理或虚拟Linux主机上运行多个隔离的Linux系统（也称为容器）。 # LXD LXD是建立在LXC基础之上的下一代系统容器管理器，由Canonical公司（Ubuntu的母公司）领导开发。LXD实际上是LXC的扩展，增加了许多用户友好的特性和改进，包括： - 更方便易用的命令行工具。 - 图形用户界面支持（通过第三方工具）。 - 更好的安全性。 - 容器镜像管理。 - 网络配置和存储管理的更多选项。 - 高级资源控制（如CPU和内存分配）。 LXD通常被描述为容器的“轻量级虚拟机管理器”，它提供了比LXC更抽象的管理层次，让容器的管理更加易于操作。 # 区别总结 - **设计目的**：LXC更专注于提供一个轻量级的隔离环境，类似于传统的虚拟机，但开销更小；而LXD旨在提供一个易于使用、功能更丰富的系统容器和虚拟机管理解决方案。 - **用户接口**：LXD提供了更友好的用户接口，包括改进的命令行工具和REST API，而LXC的用户接口相对较低级和复杂。 - **功能集**：LXD在LXC的基础上添加了更多的高级功能，如容器镜像管理、系统范围的配置和网络设置，让容器管理更加自动化和集中化。 简而言之，虽然LXC为轻量级的Linux虚拟化提供了基础，但LXD通过在LXC之上引入更高级的管理特性和改进，使得容器的操作更加易于管理和使用。"},{"prompt":"PVE是否支持LXD镜像？","completion":"截至我的知识更新点（2023年），Proxmox VE（PVE）原生并不直接支持LXD容器镜像。Proxmox VE是一套开源的服务器虚拟化管理平台，它基于KVM虚拟机和LXC容器技术，提供了易于使用的Web界面来管理虚拟机和容器。尽管PVE支持LXC容器，但它并未集成LXD的管理功能，这意味着LXD的高级功能和LXD容器镜像在PVE上无法直接使用。 LXD提供了许多LXC不具备的高级特性，包括改进的用户体验、容器快照、迁移、网络和存储的高级管理等。这些特性是通过LXD的守护进程和命令行工具（lxc）来实现的。 然而，有一些替代方法可以在Proxmox环境中使用LXD或利用LXD镜像： 1. **手动安装LXD**：在PVE虚拟机（基于Linux的虚拟机）中安装LXD是可能的。这种方式允许用户在虚拟机内部使用LXD，虚拟机本身由PVE管理。虽然这种方法提供了LXD的全部功能，但它增加了资源开销，因为每个LXD实例都运行在独立的虚拟机中。 2. **转换LXD镜像为LXC格式**：理论上，有可能手动将LXD容器镜像转换为LXC能够识别的格式，然后在Proxmox上部署。这样的转换可能涉及修改镜像文件和容器配置以匹配PVE的LXC容器配置要求。不过，这可能是一个技术上复杂且易错的过程，需要深入了解两种容器格式。 3. **直接使用LXC镜像**：作为一种简单的解决办法，可以在Proxmox VE中直接使用LXC容器，并利用其官方镜像库或第三方LXC镜像，尽管这样做无法直接利用LXD的高级特性。 综上所述，虽然PVE不直接支持LXD镜像，但还是有一定的方法可以在PVE环境中使用LXD或相关镜像。用户需要根据自己的具体需求，选择最适合的工具和方法。"},{"prompt":"debian下如何卸载docker?","completion":"在Debian或基于Debian的系统上卸载Docker，可以通过几个步骤来完成。以下是一个基本的指导，可以帮助您安全地从Debian系统中移除Docker及其相关组件： 1. **停止所有运行中的Docker容器**： 首先，您可能需要停止所有当前运行的Docker容器，以避免在卸载过程中出现问题。可以使用以下命令来停止所有容器： ```bash docker stop (docker ps -a -q) ``` 2. **卸载Docker软件包**： Debian及其衍生版通常通过`apt`软件包管理器安装Docker。如果您使用的是Docker的社区版（`docker-ce`），您需要同时卸载`docker-ce`和`docker-ce-cli`软件包。可以使用以下命令来卸载它们： ```bash sudo apt-get remove --purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io ``` `--purge`选项确保配置文件也被删除。如果还安装了其他相关的Docker软件包（如`containerd.io`），请一并卸载。 3. **清理系统**： 卸载Docker之后，可能会有一些配置文件或依赖包残留在系统上。可以使用以下命令来清理它们： ```bash sudo apt-get autoremove ``` 此命令将删除所有未再由其他软件包使用的软件包，从而帮助减少系统上的无用文件。 4. **删除Docker的数据和配置文件**： 如果您希望完全删除Docker及其所有数据（包括镜像、容器、卷和自定义配置文件），需要手动删除Docker的数据目录。这是一个重要步骤，因为`--purge`选项和`autoremove`不会删除非配置的数据文件。 ```bash sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker ``` 请谨慎使用此命令，因为它会永久删除Docker存储的所有数据。 5. **可选：删除Docker用户和组**： 如果在安装Docker时创建了特定的用户或用户组，且之后不再需要，你可以手动删除这些用户和组。请确保这些用户或组不再被系统中的其他服务使用。 通过以上步骤，您应该能够从Debian系统中完全卸载Docker及其数据。在执行这些操作之前，请确保已备份重要数据，避免意外丢失。"},{"prompt":"debian 如何安装podman？","completion":"在Debian系统上安装Podman相对简单。以下是基于Debian 10（Buster）或Debian 11（Bullseye）系统的安装步骤。如果您使用的是其他版本的Debian或基于Debian的分发版，步骤可能略有不同。 # 1. 更新软件包列表 首先，打开终端并更新您的系统的软件包列表： ```bash sudo apt update ``` # 2. 安装所需的软件包 Podman依赖于一些软件包，例如`software-properties-common`，这个软件包允许您更轻松地管理您的软件源： ```bash sudo apt install -y software-properties-common ``` # 3. 添加Podman的官方仓库 Podman的官方包可能不在Debian的默认软件仓库中，因此需要添加Podman的官方仓库。此步骤确保您安装的是最新版本。 对于Debian 11（Bullseye），您可以使用以下命令： ```bash . /etc/os-release sudo sh -c \\"echo \'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main\' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list\\" ``` 对于Debian 10（Buster），请使用： ```bash . /etc/os-release sudo sh -c \\"echo \'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main\' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list\\" ``` # 4. 安装Podman 再次更新软件包列表以包含新添加的仓库： ```bash sudo apt update ``` 现在，您可以安装Podman了。对于Debian 11（Bullseye），您应该能够直接从backports仓库安装最新版本： ```bash sudo apt -t bullseye-backports install podman ``` 对于Debian 10（Buster），使用： ```bash sudo apt -t buster-backports install podman ``` # 5. 验证安装 安装完成后，您可以通过运行以下命令来验证Podman是否已正确安装： ```bash podman --version ``` 这将显示已安装的Podman版本，确认Podman已经准备好使用。 # 总结 以上步骤展示了在Debian系统上安装Podman的方法，这些步骤应该也适用于大部分基于Debian的发行版，但可能需要小的调整。请注意，为了确保系统的稳定和安全，始终建议使用最新稳定版本的Debian和软件包。"},{"prompt":"debian12如何安装podman？","completion":"截至我的最后更新（2023年），Debian 12（代号\\"Bookworm\\"）尚未正式发布，因此下面的安装指导是基于假设Debian继续支持Podman，并根据Debian 11（Bullseye）及其对backports的处理方式给出的。在Debian 12正式发布后，安装方法可能会有所不同，但以下指导提供了一个大致的方向。 # 步骤 1: 更新软件包索引 打开终端并运行以下命令来更新您的Debian系统的软件包列表： ```bash sudo apt update ``` # 步骤 2: 安装Podman 由于Debian 12正式版本还未发布，这里假定Podman会包含在默认仓库中，或者至少可从`backports`仓库获得，类似于在Debian 11中的情况。因此，尝试直接使用apt进行安装： ```bash sudo apt install podman ``` 如果发现Podman不在默认仓库中，或者你想安装一个更新的版本，你可能需要添加`backports`仓库。由于Debian 12的具体细节尚未确定，以下是一个假设性的步骤，类似于在Debian 11中启用`backports`仓库的方法： 1. 识别出你的Debian版本名（Bookworm的情况下）： ```bash . /etc/os-release echo VERSION_CODENAME ``` 2. 添加backports到你的APT源（这里使用\\"bookworm-backports\\"作为示例，实际使用时请根据实际情况调整）： ```bash echo \\"deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main\\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bookworm-backports.list ``` 3. 更新APT索引并安装Podman： ```bash sudo apt update sudo apt -t bookworm-backports install podman ``` # 步骤 3: 验证安装 安装完成后，运行以下命令进行验证Podman是否成功安装及其版本： ```bash podman --version ``` 通过这些步骤，Podman应当能够在您的Debian 12系统上安装成功。请注意，在Debian 12正式发布后，有可能会有具体的、针对性的安装指导，因此建议查看官方文档或社区指南以获得最新的安装信息和技术支持。 # 注意 上述步骤基于在Debian 11中安装Podman的经验以及常见的Linux系统管理知识。随着Debian 12的发展和发布，实际操作过程中可能需要进行适当的调整。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For most people, blood pressure is lowest during sleeping hours and starts to rise a few hours before you wake up. It continues to rise during the day, peaking in the afternoon. Therefore, your blood pressure is generally lower in the morning, soon after waking, compared to later in the day. However, this pattern can vary depending on your overall health, medications, and lifestyle. It\'s also worth noting that conditions like high blood pressure (hypertension) can alter this natural rhythm, making monitoring and understanding your own blood pressure patterns important."},{"prompt":"If bp is 90/60 at 8am, is it normal","completion":"A blood pressure reading of 90/60 mmHg at 8 a.m. can be considered on the lower end of the blood pressure spectrum, but it may be considered normal for some individuals. Blood pressure can naturally be lower in the morning and varies greatly from one person to another depending on many factors such as age, gender, weight, medications, and overall health. The technical term for blood pressure that is consistently at or below 90/60 mmHg is hypotension. For many people, low blood pressure is not a problem, and it does not cause any noticeable symptoms. In fact, lower blood pressure can be normal for individuals who are very fit and healthy, such as athletes, and for those who do not experience any negative symptoms associated with it. However, if this blood pressure reading is significantly lower than what is usual for you or if it\'s accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, or weakness, it\'s important to consult with a healthcare provider. These symptoms could indicate that your brain and other vital organs might not be getting enough blood flow, necessitating medical evaluation. In summary, a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg at 8 a.m. can be considered normal for some individuals, particularly if there are no symptoms and it represents their typical blood pressure range. Nonetheless, it\'s always best to discuss your blood pressure readings and health concerns with a healthcare professional to ensure they are appropriate for you."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Вероятность извлечь нестандартную деталь из первой партии: [ P(text{нестандартная из 1-й партии}) = 1 - P(text{стандартная из 1-й партии}) = 1 - frac{3}{4} = frac{1}{4} ] Вероятность извлечь нестандартную деталь из второй партии: [ P(text{нестандартная из 2-й партии}) = 1 - P(text{стандартная из 2-й партии}) = 1 - frac{4}{5} = frac{1}{5} ] Вероятность того, что обе извлеченные детали будут нестандартными: [ P(text{обе нестандартные}) = P(text{нестандартная из 1-й партии}) times P(text{нестандартная из 2-й партии}) = frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{5} = frac{1}{20} ] Теперь, чтобы найти вероятность того, что хотя бы одна деталь будет стандартной, вычитаем из 1 вероятность того, что обе детали нестандартные: [ P(text{хотя бы одна стандартная}) = 1 - P(text{обе нестандартные}) = 1 - frac{1}{20} = frac{19}{20} ] Следовательно, вероятность того, что при выборе по одной детали из каждой партии хотя бы одна деталь будет стандартной, составляет (frac{19}{20})."},{"prompt":"Общий осмотр легочного больного, порядок проведения.","completion":"Осмотр легочного больного обычно включает несколько этапов, которые позволяют врачу собрать необходимую информацию о состоянии пациента и поставить предварительный диагноз. Вот основные шаги, следуя которым проводится общий осмотр легочного больного: 1. **Анамнез:** Первый шаг - это сбор анамнеза. Врач задает вопросы о симптомах, их длительности, наличии кашля, отхаркивающей мокроты, одышки, болях в грудной клетке, о потере веса и о том, курил ли пациент или подвергался воздействию определенных вредных веществ на работе или дома. 2. **Инспекция (осмотр):** Врач начинает с визуальной оценки пациента, обращая внимание на цвет кожи, наличие цианоза (синюшность кожных покровов и слизистых оболочек из-за недостатка кислорода), форму грудной клетки, положение пациента (например, предпочтение сидячего положения при одышке), и наличие видимых деформаций грудной стенки. 3. **Пальпация:** Врач проводит пальпацию (ощупывание) грудной клетки, чтобы оценить эластичность и подвижность грудной стенки, наличие болезненности. Пальпация также включает оценку голосового дрожания - вибрацию, передающуюся на грудную клетку при говорении, которая может изменяться при патологиях легочной ткани. 4. **Перкуссия (простукивание):** С помощью перкуссии врач определяет границы легких, области с повышенным или пониженным ударным звуком, что может указывать на наличие патологических процессов, таких как скопление воздуха (эмфизема) или жидкости (плеврит). 5. **Аускультация (прослушивание):** Используя стетоскоп, врач прослушивает дыхание пациента, обращая внимание на характер дыхания, наличие шумов, хрипов или свистящих звуков, которые могут указывать на различные легочные заболевания. Особое внимание уделяется изменениям в характере дыхательных шумов или появлению новых (например, сухие или влажные хрипы). 6. **Дополнительные методы исследования:** В зависимости от полученных результатов на предыдущих этапах, врач может назначить дополнительные обследования, такие как рентген грудной клетки, компьютерная томография, анализы крови, функциональные тесты, направленные на оценку функции легких и др. Оценка состояния больного требует комплексного подхода, так как многие легочные заболевания имеют схожую симптоматику. Важно собрать максимально полную клиническую картину и, при необходимости, привлечь к диагностике узких специалистов."},{"prompt":"Use the words in parentheses in their correct grammar forus to fill in the gaps. 1.
