But in the lead-up to Friday’s vote, both companies have been rocked by legal warfare. Their leaders, past and present, have traded heated accusations of deception and impropriety across four lawsuits in three states. And the cases threaten to erode Trump’s grasp on a stake in the post-merger company potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars — a possible financial lifeline, given that he owes more than 500 million in legal fines. After Trump was booted from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, three men played pivotal roles in building and promoting Trump Media as an online challenger against the “cancel culture” of Big Tech: Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, former “Apprentice” contestants who co-founded the company and launched Truth Social; and Patrick Orlando, who as chief executive of Digital World, a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, offered Trump’s company a path to investor cash. But all three are now leading a rebellion of their own, confronting and potentially imperiling a trophy of Trump’s post-presidential ambitions. Their lawsuits call into question how Trump Media’s shares will be distributed, and a legal victory could chip away at Trump’s equity during a time when he is facing a cash crunch. Follow Election 2024 The litigation won’t stop Friday’s shareholder meeting, during which Digital World has said it will announce whether a majority of investors voted to approve the merger. But the hundreds of pages of legal filings in the four cases offer clues to answers for some long-running questions about the companies’ inner workings and expose details of the turmoil that has characterized efforts to create a pro-Trump internet empire. In the most recent lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a New York state court, Digital World asked a judge to force Orlando to vote in support of the merger, saying he could tank the deal by not voting shares owned by a company he controls — Digital World’s biggest founding investor, Arc Global Investments II. Trump and Patrick Orlando pose for a photo at the former president's Bedminster, N.J., golf club in 2021. (Will Wilkerson) “The merger vote is now less than one week away … and yet, Arc refuses to lodge its vote,” Digital World attorneys said in the complaint. If Digital World “fails to effectuate a merger, it will be forced to dissolve. Urgent relief is required by March 22 to avert such harm.” Usha Rodrigues, a University of Georgia law professor who studies SPACs, said the level of turmoil was unusual for a deal like this. A merger vote, she said, is “typically a nonevent” because investors just want it to get done. “SPAC mergers typically do not go like this,” she said. But “this whole process has been idiosyncratic, as everything has been with this SPAC.” Trump Media attorney Jesse Binnall said in a statement Thursday, “These allegations simply add to the heap of false claims, defamation, and fake news about Truth Social for which the Washington Post is already being sued.” Representatives for Trump’s presidential campaign, Digital World, Arc, Orlando, Litinsky and Moss did not respond to requests for comment. The merger vote will be widely watched by observers of Trump’s finances. If the deal is approved, Trump would own about 60 percent of the post-merger company, a stake that at Digital World’s current price would be worth more than 3 billion. That money could eventually go toward Trump’s high-profile legal penalties. He failed to finance an appeal bond for more than 450 million to cover a judgment in the New York attorney general’s business fraud case against him, his attorneys said Monday, citing “insurmountable difficulties.” A lockup provision in the Trump Media merger agreement, however, would block Trump and other major investors from selling their shares for six months after the merger’s closing date, which could be as soon as Friday — unless Trump gets a waiver from Digital World or the post-merger Trump Media’s leaders allowing him to sell sooner. Such lockup periods are standard provisions in corporate deals, designed to instill confidence in investors that the leaders won’t sell before enough time has passed to see how the company performs. Digital World’s stock price dropped this week to a two-month low before rebounding to about 43 — about 15 percent below its peak last month, when the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed the merger deal to proceed. After a merger vote, the combined companies would go by Trump Media and trade under a new stock ticker symbol, DJT — Trump’s initials. That symbol was also used for Trump’s only other public company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, whose stock plunged from nearly 35 to around 17 cents in less than a decade before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2004.

In one case, Arc sued Digital World, its new chief executive, Eric Swider, and three members of its board, saying they intended to improperly deprive Orlando of millions of previously guaranteed shares. In a separate case, Litinsky and Moss sued Trump Media, claiming in a recently unsealed complaint that the company had authorized the issuing of 1 billion new shares of company stock — a move they say would dramatically dilute their stake, from 8.6 percent down to less than 1 percent. Attorneys for Litinsky and Moss’s partnership, United Atlantic Ventures, said Trump intended to “use his domination and control” of the company’s board to place some or all of the new shares “in his own hands and those of [people] beholden to him.” UAV’s attorneys argued in a motion that the alleged attempt, which Trump Media has disputed, was driven by Trump’s need for cash. The merger “represents a potential (and perhaps existential) liquidity event for Trump, which may explain his last-minute stock grab,” the motion said. In their lawsuit, the men reiterated a claim, first reported by The Washington Post in 2022, that Trump had pressured Litinsky to hand over some of his shares to Trump’s wife, Melania. After Litinsky resisted, the lawsuit says, Trump pushed both men out. Trump Media said in 2022 that The Post’s report was based on “concocted psychodramas.” Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait for the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House in 2018. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) In both cases, the judges rejected the plaintiffs’ requests to postpone the merger vote until their cases were resolved. Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III, in the UAV case, and Vice Chancellor Lori W. Will, in the Arc case, said putting the disputed shares into an escrow account, so that the lawsuits’ victors could take them over once the cases are finished, should suffice. But both judges have also indicated they would prefer to resolve the disputes within a few months, meaning that the cases could shift the ownership for hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of stock before the lockup period ends. Digital World has warned investors that Arc could play a show-stopping role in the merger deal. As Digital World’s sponsor, Arc owns about 15 percent of its outstanding stock, including a majority of a stock class known as “founder shares,” according to an SEC filing last month. In the filing, Digital World said its relationship with Orlando had seen a “continued deterioration” and that, if Arc withheld votes supporting the merger, it could “lead to our liquidation.” In a third lawsuit, filed in New York, Digital World sued to force Arc to vote in favor of the deal, saying Orlando could not hold the vote “hostage for his personal gain.” In a Monday email submitted as an exhibit in the case, Orlando wrote that Arc had been “repeatedly pressed” to vote before the meeting but that “Arc is not going to do that.” ‘Revenge campaign’ In a fourth lawsuit, filed in Florida, Trump Media and Digital World returned fire at Arc and Orlando, saying the Miami financier had attempted a “blatant shakedown extortion effort” against the companies to maximize his personal stake. An amended complaint Sunday, featuring the names of nine attorneys representing Trump Media and Digital World, alleged that Orlando and Arc’s “self-dealing, irrational and disturbing behavior” had “imposed massive costs” and caused “extensive reputational harm.” They want to “extort more compensation in the merger by threatening to destroy it entirely — an existential threat to [Digital World] itself,” the complaint said. The complaint blamed Orlando for the SEC investigation that Digital World agreed last year to pay 18 million to settle once the merger deal finalizes. It also alleged that the SEC sent Orlando a letter, known as a Wells notice, indicating that he could face charges for violating securities laws. (The SEC declined to comment.) Orlando’s “reckless and irrational behavior,” the complaint said, had included withdrawing 15,000 in cash for unexplained expenses and leaking merger details to the press — an act that was exposed when Orlando “excused himself to take another phone call but forgot to mute the first call.” Trump Media executives celebrate investment deal 0:34 In a video Will Wilkerson sent to the SEC, Digital World and Trump Media executives toast an investment deal on Oct. 26, 2021. (Video: Will Wilkerson) The complaint also alleged that Orlando kept invoices and contracts in his personal email account, leading the company to omit multiple vendors from its financial reports. His mismanagement, it said, helped drive the company’s auditor to resign. (Trump Media sued The Post for 3.8 billion last year, saying the news organization had reported incorrectly on allegations concerning its financing. A federal judge in Florida dismissed the case this month but allowed Trump Media to amend its complaint if it believes it can state a viable claim.) After Digital World’s board fired Orlando last March as its chief executive, Orlando discouraged people from investing in the company “based on his own personal grievances,” saying it was “his turn to make the life of the new CEO miserable,” the complaint said. In recent months, Orlando has refused to resign from the Digital World board — a necessary step to allow for a new post-merger board — unless the company provides him shares and stock options, known as warrants, worth more than 222 million at the time of the lawsuit’s filing, according to the complaint. Though Orlando was once a prominent Trump ally, even writing him a birthday letter in 2021 telling Trump he was “unaware of the extent of your brilliance,” the legal claims suggest the dispute has become deeply bitter and personal. In the Florida case, a process server handed Orlando the summons papers one afternoon outside a private elementary school in the Miami neighborhood of Coconut Grove, a court filing shows. Even more facts could come out in the weeks ahead. Orlando posted a photo last month to Truth Social showing him wearing a Truth Social hat with the caption “TRUTH! John 8:32” — a Bible verse that reads, “Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.","completion":"Let's break down the article into simpler terms: 1. **Introduction to the Companies and Their Leaders**: Former President Donald Trump's company, Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, planned to merge with another company called Digital World Acquisition. This merger is a big deal because it could make Trump's company a public one, potentially worth billions. The key players involved are Andy Litinsky and Wes Moss, who helped start Trump Media, and Patrick Orlando, who runs Digital World Acquisition. They were initially working together, but now there's a lot of conflict. 2. **The Legal Battles**: There are legal fights happening across four lawsuits in three different states. These lawsuits involve some harsh accusations like lying and misconduct, and they're complicating the merger. The disputes could impact Trump’s control over the merged company and affect how much money he can make from it. This is particularly important for Trump because he owes a lot of money in legal fines. 3. **What’s at Stake with the Merger**: If the merger happens, Trump could end up owning about 60% of the new company, which could be worth over 3 billion. This money is important for Trump, especially since he owes over 500 million. 4. **Problems Leading Up to the Vote**: There's a lot of drama around a shareholder vote needed to approve the merger. One lawsuit wants to force Orlando to vote in favor of the merger because he controls a significant amount of vital votes through his investment company. The article notes that this level of chaos is unusual for these types of business deals. 5. **Specific Lawsuits and Complaints**: The lawsuits include claims that some people were promised shares that they're now being denied, accusations that Trump is trying to snatch up more shares for himself, and personal disputes like Trump asking for shares to be given to his wife, Melania. These disputes have not stopped the merger vote but have added a lot of tension and drama. 6. **Consequences of the Legal Battles**: The fights not only threaten the merger but also reveal a lot of inside information about how the companies operate and the disagreements among its leaders. Regardless of the drama, the goal is for the merged company, Trump Media, to go public and trade under a new stock symbol, DJT. In simpler terms, Trump's company wants to merge with another to go public and potentially earn a lot of money. However, a series of legal battles involving accusations of lying and other misconduct among its leaders are complicating matters. These disputes could affect the outcome of the merger and how much money Trump can make from it."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This typically means that Node.js is not installed on your system, or if it is, \`npm\` (Node Package Manager) is not properly set up in your system's PATH variable. NPM comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js is how you generally get access to \`npm\`. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue: # 1. Check if Node.js is Installed First, check if Node.js is already installed on your system. You can do this by opening a new command prompt or terminal window and typing: \`\`\`shell node -v \`\`\` This command should return the version of Node.js installed. If you receive an error similar to the one with \`npm\`, Node.js might not be installed. # 2. Install Node.js If Node.js is not installed, you’ll need to install it. **For Windows:** - Go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). - Download the Windows Installer (.msi) for the version you need (LTS version recommended for most users). - Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js and npm. Ensure that the installer adds Node.js to your PATH. **For macOS:** - You can download the macOS Installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). The installation process is straightforward; just continue through the prompts. - Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Homebrew by running \`brew install node\`. **For Linux:** The method can vary depending on your distribution, but for most, you can use a package manager. For example, on Ubuntu: \`\`\`shell sudo apt update sudo apt install nodejs npm \`\`\` # 3. Verify Installation After installation, restart your command prompt or terminal and try running: \`\`\`shell node -v npm -v \`\`\` These commands should now return the versions of Node.js and npm installed on your system, respectively. # 4. Add npm to PATH Manually (If Necessary) If \`npm\` is still not recognized (but Node.js is working), you might need to add npm’s directory to your system’s PATH environment variable manually. This step can vary based on your operating system, and you’ll typically find \`npm\` in the same directory where Node.js is installed. **For Windows:** - Find where Node.js is installed (often in \`C:Program Filesnodejs\`). - Add that directory to your System Environment Variables under \\"Path\\". - Restart your command prompt and try running \`npm -v\` again. **For macOS/Linux:** - You might need to add \`export PATH=/usr/local/share/npm/bin:PATH\` to your \`~/.bash_profile\` or \`~/.zshrc\` (depending on your shell), then run \`source ~/.bash_profile\` or \`source ~/.zshrc\` to apply the changes.

En la descripción tenemos que cada 1 de los equipos ha desarrollado una idea de negocio a partir de una mega tendencia de Trend Hunter. Luego de tener las propuestas en marcha de su negocio, los emprendedores se enfrentan a problemas comunes que tienen los clientes y que tendrán que resolver para innovar constantemente en su negocio. Los estudiantes propondrán una problemática general que sucedería usualmente en el rubro de sus negocios propuestos, propuestos en elaboración continua número dos. 0:36 0 minutes 36 seconds A partir de dicha problemática, desarrollarán las 3 primeras etapas de la metodología Design thinking para innovar en su emprendimiento. ¿Entre los pasos que debemos realizar se encuentra en la de proponer una problemática general y realizar una pregunta general y retadora, cómo podríamos ayudar en este caso al cliente? Necesitamos identificar a los actores, diseñar y redactar el instrumento de. 1:05 1 minute 5 seconds De evaluación para recoger la información de los usuarios. 1:09 1 minute 9 seconds Tanto si fuese una ruta cualitativa o cuantitativa, los estudiantes van a escoger un miembro del equipo para que se convierta en cliente quien sea quien recogerá la información que presenta como evidente, por ejemplo, podría hacer una entrevista a 1 de los clientes de su rubro de negocio. 1:29 1 minute 29 seconds Realizarán la técnica para encontrar el Inside. 1:33 1 minute 33 seconds En este caso, la espina de Chicago, un problema principal y plantear la pregunta generadora. 1:38 1 minute 38 seconds Por último, van a ejecutar una técnica de ideación por medio de la aplicación figma o también dentro de la plantilla que voy a mostrar a continuación con un análisis YY evaluación de la factibilidad. 1:54 1 minute 54 seconds Como logro destacado en este caso se encuentran parte de los criterios divididos en dos de la empatía, de la definición y de la idea.

However, exposure to high temperatures for even a short period can potentially lead to a number of detrimental effects on the medication's safety, effectiveness, and physical properties. These may include: 1. **Degradation of Active Ingredients:** Many medications contain active ingredients that are sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Exposure to high temperatures can lead to chemical degradation, reducing the medication's potency and, consequently, its effectiveness. 2. **Changes in Physical Form:** Medications in solid form, such as tablets or capsules, might melt or change shape when exposed to high temperatures. Modifications in a medication's physical form can affect its dissolution rate, which in turn can influence its absorption and effectiveness. 3. **Separation of Components:** For medications in liquid form, high temperatures can cause the components to separate or degrade. This can lead to an uneven distribution of the active ingredient when the medication is administered. 4. **Degradation of Excipients:** The excipients, or inactive ingredients, in a medication can also be affected by high temperatures. Though these ingredients are not active, they can play crucial roles in the medication's delivery system, stability, and bioavailability. Their degradation can thus influence the medication's overall performance. 5. **Increased Risk of Bacterial Growth:** Excessive heat can compromise the preservatives in medications, especially in liquid formulations, increasing the risk of bacterial contamination and growth. 6. **Loss of Sterility:** For sterile medications, such as those used for injections, exposure to high temperatures can compromise their sterility, posing significant health risks if administered. It's important to note that the specific effects and their severity depend on the duration of the exposure, the exact temperatures involved, and the nature of the medication. If there is any concern about a medication's exposure to high temperatures, it is best to consult with a pharmacist or healthcare professional before using it. They can advise whether the medication is still safe to use or if a replacement is necessary."},{"prompt":"Почему не выводятся логи ? import logging import os from datetime import datetime from .helper import Helper class Logger: def __new__(cls): if not hasattr(cls, \\"instance\\"): cls.instance = super(Logger, cls).__new__(cls) return cls.instance def __init__(self): config = Helper.load_json(\\"auth_data.json\\") directory = config[\\"logs\\"][\\"directory\\"] project_name = config[\\"project_name\\"] now = datetime.now().strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d\\") if directory and not os.path.isdir(directory): os.mkdir(directory) logging.basicConfig( format=\\"%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s\\", level=logging.INFO, handlers=[ logging.FileHandler(f\\"{directory}/{now}_{project_name}.log\\", encoding=\\"UTF-8\\"), logging.StreamHandler(), ], ) @staticmethod def write_info(message): logging.info(message) @staticmethod def write_debug(message): logging.debug(message) @staticmethod def write_warning(message): logging.warning(message) @staticmethod def write_exception(message): logging.exception(message) @staticmethod def write_error(message, exc_info=False): logging.error(message, exc_info=exc_info)","completion":"Из вашего кода видно, что Вы организовали логирование с помощью модуля \`logging\` в Python и создали класс-одиночку \`Logger\` для работы с логами. Однако, встречается ряд общих проблем, которые могут привести к тому, что логи не выводятся, как ожидалось. Вот несколько моментов, на которые стоит обратить внимание: 1. **Уровень логирования**: проверьте, что уровень логирования установлен соответствующим образом. Вы установили уровень логирования \`logging.INFO\`, что означает, что сообщения с уровнем \`DEBUG\` будут игнорироваться. Убедитесь, что при использовании методов вроде \`write_debug\` уровень логирования это позволяет, или измените уровень логирования на \`DEBUG\`. \`\`\`python logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG) \`\`\` 2. **Повторная настройка логирования**: вызов метода \`basicConfig\` возможен только один раз для настройки корневого логгера. В случае повторного вызова он не будет иметь эффекта, если корневой логгер уже был сконфигурирован. Проверьте, не выполняется ли настройка логирования многократно, особенно если ваше приложение создает несколько экземпляров класса \`Logger\` или вызывает его из разных мест. 3. **Путь к файлу логирования**: проверьте, что путь, указанный для файлов логирования, корректен и приложение имеет достаточные права для записи файлов в эту директорию. Также проверьте, что директория существует. В вашем коде есть проверка на существование директории и создание её при отсутствии, что хорошо. Однако, возможны проблемы с правами доступа. 4. **Отладка проблемы**: если логи всё еще не выводятся, попытайтесь вручную добавить логгирование в сам начало метода \`__init__\` вашего класса \`Logger\` или в другие ключевые места кода, чтобы проверить, выполняется ли весь код, как ожидается. Используйте \`print\` для вывода сообщений в консоль, чтобы убедиться, что код выполняется. 5. **Реализация Singleton**: хотя вы реализовали паттерн Singleton для класса \`Logger\`, стоит убедиться, что он корректно работает и не создаётся несколько экземпляров логгера в вашем приложении. Это может влиять на поведение логгирования, если предполагалось, что конфигурация применится глобально. Если после проверки этих моментов проблема сохраняется, стоит подробнее изучить сообщения об ошибках или поведение программы, чтобы выяснить причину, по которой логи не выводятся."},{"prompt":"Wizzles Whimsical Woodland Adventures, generate a random story with a great lesson at the end","completion":"Once in the heart of the Everbright Forest, where the trees whispered secrets of old and the rivers hummed lullabies of the wild, there existed a curious creature named Wizzles. Wizzles was not like any ordinary woodland inhabitant; he was a small, furry being with large, expressive eyes and ears that fluttered in the wind, picking up whispers and stories carried by the breeze. One sunny morning, Wizzles set off on an adventure, propelled by his insatiable curiosity and a desire to discover something truly whimsical. His heart thrummed with excitement as he scampered through the underbrush, his keen eyes observing the enchantments of the forest with childlike wonder. His journey led him to the Mystic Glade, a place rumored to be filled with magic and mysteries. It was there that Wizzles encountered a peculiar sight: a tree glowing with an ethereal light, its branches adorned with countless sparkling gemstones instead of leaves. Fascinated, Wizzles approached the radiant tree, only to find it guarded by a majestic unicorn named Lumina. Lumina, with her coat as white as snow and a mane that shimmered like the Milky Way, eyed Wizzles warily. \\"Wizzles, I have seen your heart, pure and true,\\" spoke Lumina in a voice that resonated with the magic of the forest. \\"However, to touch the Jewel Tree, one must understand the true essence of giving.\\" Wizzles, puzzled, inquired, \\"But, what does giving have to do with the Jewel Tree?\\" Lumina's eyes softened. \\"The gems of the Jewel Tree are not mere ornaments. Each gem represents a good deed, a selfless act of kindness. Only those who have given freely, expecting nothing in return, can truly appreciate the tree's beauty.\\" Inspired by Lumina's words, Wizzles embarked on a new quest. He spread kindness throughout the Everbright Forest, helping his fellow woodland creatures without a second thought for rewards. He shared his food with those in need, lent a listening ear to troubled friends, and went out of his way to make the forest a better place for everyone. Days turned into weeks, and Wizzles continued his acts of kindness, the joy of giving filling his heart. Then, one radiant morning, he returned to the Mystic Glade. Lumina greeted him, a gentle smile gracing her features. \\"Wizzles, you have discovered the joy of selflessness. Because you have given so much, you have already received the greatest treasure.\\" Wizzles looked at the Jewel Tree and then back at Lumina, realization dawning upon him. The true treasure was not the sparkling gems adorning the branches but the love and gratitude he had earned from his friends in the forest. And so, Wizzles learned that the essence of true wealth lies not in possessing treasures but in giving selflessly and enriching the lives of others. With a heart full of love and a spirit enriched by selflessness, Wizzles continued his whimsical woodland adventures, a beacon of kindness in the Everbright Forest. The lesson of Wizzles's story spread throughout the woodland: \\"The richest heart is one that gives, for in giving, we receive the greatest gifts of all.\\""},{"prompt":"getting incomplete input in model.generate","completion":"When working with sequence generation models, such as those employed in natural language processing (NLP) tasks (like GPT-2, GPT-3, BERT-based generative models, etc.), it's not uncommon to run into issues where the model generates incomplete outputs. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to the model's configuration, the nature of the prompt you're providing, and the limitations inherent to the model itself. Here are several tips and methodologies to address and potentially resolve issues related to incomplete input generation: 1. **Adjust the Maximum Length Parameter**: Most generative models have a parameter that controls the maximum length of the generated sequence. If the output is consistently being cut off, consider increasing this value. Be cautious, though, as setting it too high can affect performance or lead to overly verbose outputs. 2. **Check the Stop Criteria**: Some models allow you to specify conditions under which generation should stop, such as upon reaching specific tokens (e.g., period for sentence end). Ensure these aren't set too restrictively, causing premature termination. 3. **Manipulate the Temperature**: The \\"temperature\\" controls the randomness in the generation process. A lower temperature makes the model more conservative and likely to stick to higher probability sequences, while a higher temperature encourages more diversity and risks generating nonsensical sequences. Adjusting this parameter can sometimes help with completing inputs more sensibly. 4. **Tweak Top-k and Top-p Sampling**: These parameters control the sampling process used for generation. Top-k sampling restricts the model to sampling from the k most likely next words, while top-p sampling (also known as nucleus sampling) picks from the smallest possible set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds the value p. Adjusting these can influence the coherence and completion of generated text. 5. **Use Padding and Attention Masks**: For models that support it, ensuring that your input is properly padded and that attention masks are correctly set can help ensure that the model pays attention to the right parts of the input and generates more complete and relevant outputs. 6. **Prompt Engineering**: Sometimes, the way a prompt is structured can greatly influence how a model generates text. Experimenting with different formulations of your input prompt, including adding more context, can help the model generate more complete and coherent outputs. 7. **Review Model Limitations**: Understand the limitations of your model, including its maximum token limit, its training data, and the tasks it was optimized for. Some models may inherently struggle with generating certain types of content or may be biased towards shorter outputs based on their training. 8. **Experiment with Different Models**: If feasible, experimenting with different models or configurations can also help. Some models may inherently be better suited to your specific generation tasks than others. If you're facing issues with incomplete inputs, experiment with these strategies to find what best resolves your specific issue. Remember, tuning generative models is often an iterative process requiring experimentation to optimize performance for your use case."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Assuming that the running time for sorting n elements within range 1…k using Counting Sort is 2n+2k, calculate the running time for each of the following strategies a), b) and c). Show the justification. a) treat letters at each of the four positions as a digit. b) treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 as a digit and 2-letter subwords at positions 3- 4 as another digit. c) treat all 4 letters as a digit. d) which strategy is the best strategy to minimize the running time? (2 points)","completion":"To calculate the running time for each of the strategies, we apply the formula given for sorting (n) elements within the range (1 ldots k) which is (2n + 2k), where (n) is the number of elements to sort (100,000 4-letter words) and (k) is the range of values each \\"digit\\" can take. # a) Treat letters at each of the four positions as a digit. Since we're dealing with lowercase English letters, each position (or \\"digit\\") can take one of 26 possible values ((k = 26)). For each of the four positions, we sort 100,000 words based on that position. Since there are 4 positions, we repeat this process 4 times. So, the running time is (4 times (2n + 2k) = 4 times (2 times 100,000 + 2 times 26) = 800,208). # b) Treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 as a digit and 2-letter subwords at positions 3-4 as another digit. For positions 1-2, we have (26^2 = 676) possible 2-letter combinations, similarly for positions 3-4. So, (k = 676) for each of these sorts. Since we reduce our sorting to 2 rounds (each sorting based on 2-letter subwords), our formula is applied twice. Running time: (2 times (2n + 2k) = 2 times (2 times 100,000 + 2 times 676) = 401,352). # c) Treat all 4 letters as a digit. Now, considering all 4 letters as a single \\"digit\\", we have (26^4 = 456,976) possible combinations, which is our (k). The sorting is done in one round. Running time: (1 times (2n + 2k) = 2 times 100,000 + 2 times 456,976 = 1,113,952). # d) Which strategy is the best strategy to minimize the running time? The best strategy to minimize the running time, based on the calculations, is: - **Strategy a)** with a running time of (800,208). This is faster than both treating the 2-letter subwords as digits ((401,352), which is actually slower, my mistake in preliminary analysis) or treating all 4 letters as a single digit ((1,113,952)). Among the strategies provided, focusing on individual letters yields the best performance under the given formula, thus making it the best choice for minimizing the total running time. My earlier conclusion was incorrect upon re-examination; the corrected interpretation shows that strategy a) indeed offers the most efficient approach given its lower operational cost compared to the others, particularly when we consider the computational simplicity and lower k values involved. Strategy b) mistakenly noted for being faster reflects an oversight in comparison; the correct ascending order of efficiency based on running time is strategy a), then b), and lastly c), with a) being the most efficient."},{"prompt":"give three suggestions on how parents can support their child's learning at home about the IEYC topic Earthworms and bugs habitat.

This error is likely related to the parameters being passed to the function and their expected types. The \`mysqli_select_db()\` function is used to change the default database for the connection object. It expects two parameters: 1. **link**: The MySQL connection object (returned by \`mysqli_connect\` or \`new mysqli\`) 2. **dbname**: The database name as a string that you want to select Here is the function's signature for clarity: \`\`\`php mysqli_select_db(link, dbname); \`\`\` # Common Causes for the TypeError 1. **Wrong Parameter Types**: The most common cause for the error is passing the wrong type of parameters. Ensure that \`link\` is a valid MySQLi connection object and \`dbname\` is a string. 2. **Parameter Order**: Mixing up the order of parameters can also lead to this error. Ensure that the connection object is the first parameter, followed by the database name. 3. **Deprecated MySQL Extension**: If you mistakenly use the \`mysqli_select_db()\` function thinking about the old \`mysql_select_db()\` but mix up the resources and parameters expected by the MySQLi extension, it could result in type errors. Ensure you're consistently using MySQLi functions and objects. # How to Fix 1. **Check Parameter Types**: Make sure you are passing the correct types to the function. The first should be the MySQL connection object, and the second should be the name of the database you wish to select, as a string. 2. **Correct Usage Example**: \`\`\`php // Connect to MySQL link = mysqli_connect(\\"localhost\\", \\"my_user\\", \\"my_password\\"); // Check connection if(!link) { die(\\"Connection failed: \\" . mysqli_connect_error()); } // Select the database db_selected = mysqli_select_db(link, \\"my_database\\"); if(!db_selected) { die(\\"Can't use my_database : \\" . mysqli_error(link)); } \`\`\` 3. **Ensure Consistent Use of MySQLi**: If you are refactoring code from the old \`mysql\` extension to \`mysqli\`, make sure all parts of your database interaction code use \`mysqli\` consistently, including connection and function calls.

The \`interpolate()\` method doesn't work for non-numeric data types like strings. For such cases, you'll need a different strategy for filling missing values in string-type columns. One common approach is to forward-fill (\`ffill\`) or back-fill (\`bfill\`) non-numeric columns after the resampling. This means new rows created during the resampling will inherit the \`Symbol\` value from the previous row (with \`ffill\`) or the next row (with \`bfill\`).

Given your scenario, it seems like you want to ensure that after resampling your DataFrame to an hourly frequency, all rows (including newly created ones) have appropriate \`Symbol\` values. Assuming you've already tried forward-filling (\`ffill\`) as suggested but it didn't solve your problem, let's ensure we correctly implement and apply operations to all relevant parts of your DataFrame. The task is to resample your DataFrame to an hourly frequency and ensure both numeric and non-numeric columns are appropriately handled post-resampling. Here's a revised approach: **Step 1:** Perform the resampling to ensure your DateTime index is at an hourly frequency. At this point, all numeric columns can be interpolated if you'd like. **Step 2:** Specifically forward-fill non-numeric columns after resampling. Ensuring you do not accidentally apply numerical interpolations to non-numeric data. **Revisiting the Code with an Emphasis on Missing Data Handling:** We'll focus more specifically on ensuring non-numeric data is appropriately managed. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np def fill_missing_hours_optimized(csv_file, output_file): # Read CSV with date parsing for 'Date'.

This ensures that every hourly row has a \`Symbol\` value, copying the last known value down to fill any gaps. 4. **Final Cleanup and Output:** Unneeded columns are cleaned out, and the DataFrame, with the 'Date' index reset back to a column, is saved to a CSV file.

This type of error typically occurs when the types of the arguments passed to the function don't match what's expected. # Understanding \`mysqli_select_db()\` The \`mysqli_select_db()\` function is used to change the default database for the connection. It expects two parameters: 1. **mysqli**: The MySQLi connection object. 2. **dbname**: The name of the database you want to select as a string. # Common Causes of the Error 1. **Incorrect Parameter Types**: The most common cause for the error is passing arguments of incorrect types. For instance, passing the database name as the first parameter and the MySQLi connection object as the second would cause this error because the function expects them in the reverse order. 2. **Not Using an Object Instance for the First Argument**: If you're using object-oriented style, ensure the first argument is the MySQLi object (i.e., the connection variable). # Examples Procedural Style (Correct way) \`\`\`php link = mysqli_connect(\\"localhost\\", \\"my_user\\", \\"my_password\\"); // Correct order of parameters mysqli_select_db(link, 'my_database'); \`\`\` Object-Oriented Style (Correct way) \`\`\`php mysqli = new mysqli(\\"localhost\\", \\"my_user\\", \\"my_password\\"); // Correct usage with object mysqli->select_db('my_database'); \`\`\` # How to Fix 1. **Verify Argument Order**: Ensure you are passing the MySQLi link identifier as the first argument and the database name as the second. 2. **Matching Argument Types**: Make sure the arguments match the expected types: the connection object or resource for the first parameter and a string for the database name. 3. **Use the Correct Style Consistently**: If you're using the object-oriented style, make sure to call the method on the MySQLi object. If you're using procedural style, pass the link identifier as the first parameter. 4. **Check for Typos**: A simple spelling mistake in the function name or parameters can also cause issues. Double-check your syntax. 5. **Confirm Connection Success**: Before attempting to select a database, ensure that your connection to MySQL was successful. Attempting to select a database on a failed connection would also result in errors. If you adjust your usage of \`mysqli_select_db()\` according to these guidelines and ensure the rest of your connection code is correct, the issue should be resolved."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Wouldn't it solve the world poverty?","completion":"Printing more money might seem like a simple solution to combat poverty, but it unfortunately does not work in practice due to the phenomenon of inflation. Here’s why indiscriminately increasing the money supply can't solve poverty and can actually exacerbate economic problems: 1. **Inflation**: When a country prints more money without a corresponding increase in its production of goods and services, the value of its currency deteriorates. This is because the increase in money supply leads to more money chasing the same amount of goods and services, which usually results in price increases or inflation. In simple terms, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services, which reduces the purchasing power of the population, particularly affecting those on fixed incomes or with savings. 2. **Hyperinflation**: In extreme cases, if a country continues to print money to pay off debts or stimulate the economy, it may enter a state of hyperinfinity. Hyperinflation is inflation that is very high and out of control, where prices increase rapidly as the currency loses its value. Historical examples include Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the late 2000s, and Venezuela in the 2010s. Hyperinflation leads to the destabilization of economies, resulting in people's life savings becoming virtually worthless overnight. 3. **Loss of Confidence**: The value of money is not only based on the physical paper or coins but also on the trust and confidence that people have in its value. If people believe that money will continue to lose its value because the government keeps printing more, they may lose faith in the currency. This can lead to people trying to spend it quickly before it devalues further or move their assets into more stable foreign currencies or assets like gold. A loss in confidence in the currency can lead to a further acceleration of inflation and economic instability. 4. **Interest Rates and Investment**: To combat inflation, central banks might increase interest rates, which makes borrowing more expensive. While this can help control inflation, it can also slow economic growth, making it more difficult for businesses to invest and grow. This can lead to a reduction in job creation, impacting everyone, especially those who are economically vulnerable. 5. **External Trade**: The value of a country's currency on the international market can be negatively impacted by excessive money printing, leading to a devaluation. A weaker currency makes imports more expensive and can contribute to domestic inflation. While it might make exports cheaper and potentially more competitive, the overall instability can discourage foreign investment. To effectively address poverty, strategies need to focus on sustainable economic growth, education, healthcare, infrastructure development, and social safety nets that protect the vulnerable. These approaches aim to increase the production of goods and services and improve the distribution of wealth and opportunities, rather than merely increasing the money supply without addressing underlying issues."},{"prompt":"I don't understand. Explain it in simple English","completion":"Okay, let's simplify it. Imagine if everyone in a town suddenly found a lot of gold. You'd think that's great because now everyone is rich, right? But, if everyone has lots of gold, then the bakery that used to sell a loaf of bread for a small piece of gold might start asking for a big piece of gold instead. That's because the baker knows everyone has lots of gold, and the gold doesn't seem as special or valuable as before. So, when a country just prints more money without actually making or doing more things (like making more bread, toys, or offering services), it's like everyone finding gold. At first, people might feel rich, but soon, they'll see that everything costs more money than before. That's because the extra money makes each piece of money less special or valuable. This situation can get really bad, with prices going up really fast, and people's savings not worth much anymore because they need a lot more money to buy things. This is called inflation, and when it gets super out of control, it's called hyperinflation. Just making more money without increasing things to buy leads to problems like: 1. **Things get more expensive (inflation).** 2. **Money feels less valuable, and people want to spend it quickly.** 3. **It can be harder for businesses to plan and grow if they're unsure how much things will cost in the future.** 4. **It can make the country's money worth less compared to money from other countries, making it expensive to buy things from outside the country.** To really help people and reduce poverty, it's better to focus on things like making sure everyone gets a good education, ensuring there are enough jobs, and making essentials like healthcare available. This way, everyone can contribute more effectively to the economy, and the value of the money stays stable."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He possesses a lean and muscular body, with unique Stormfører traits. His long, thick dark blond hair cascades down to his shoulders. His face is chiseled, with a strong brow and a defined jawline that includes a dimpled chin and a five o'clock shadow that adds to his rugged appeal. His steel-grey eyes are slightly slanted upwards and hooded, giving him a menacing and captivating look. The combination of threat and charm is irresistible to many. The Viking uniform worn by Gunnar Stormfører in Jujutsu Kaisen is a customized school uniform that combines traditional Viking elements with modern design. The deep maroon tunic fits the color code of Kyoto Jujutsu High, with only one symbol embroidered and in dark gold - the symbol of Yggdrasil and its roots, which extend down the trim. The uniform is accessorized with leather belts, arm bands, and boots, all in dark shades of brown. Gunnar carries a sheathed seax known as Man Opener, completing his fierce and powerful look. His unique Viking uniform sets him apart from the other students at the school, showcasing his heritage and strength.

To protect his sister Pia, he's been blackmailed into serving as an assassin for the same people responsible for killing Stanis He seems to take it in stride. At the very surface level, he appears to be a ruthless killer with no regard for anyone other than his family. On a deeper level... he kind of still is. It's part of his character, but it isn't the full story. Gunnar is typically stoic, aloof, and blunt, often coming off as cold and distant. He doesn't mince words and has a no-nonsense attitude, preferring action over idle chatter. Despite his claim that he only serves his family, his actions often imply otherwise. He has protected Mai because he believed it was wrong for her family to abuse her. But he simply does not want other people foisting their problems onto him. A seldom-seen side of him also implies a love for his birth country of Iceland, and a desire to return whenever possible. Gunnar is also a skilled chef, and perfectly willing to cook for people he dislikes, or complete strangers, as long as they are not outright enemies. He's studied and experimented with Nordic, German and Italian cuisines. He is the youngest Grade 1 sorcerer. His ability is Skjelvet, which translates to \\"The Tremors\\" in Norwegian.","completion":"Given Gunnar Stormfører's nickname, \\"Killer Whale,\\" and his unique backstory and personality traits, it would make sense for his superpower, Skjelvet (The Tremors), to be intricately tied to both his heritage and his moniker. Here's a conceptual development for Gunnar's superpower: # Skjelvet (The Tremors) - Curse Technique: **Primary Ability:** Gunnar's cursed energy can manifest as seismic waves, mimicking the characteristics of both terrestrial tremors and the powerful, disruptive force of a killer whale's echolocation. This dual nature allows him to utilize his power in a versatile set of ways: - **Seismic Sense:** Much like a killer whale uses echolocation to navigate and hunt, Gunnar can sense vibrations through any medium, giving him a heightened awareness of his surroundings. This allows him to detect movements, be it an adversary's or a Cursed Spirit's, even through solid obstacles or in complete darkness, making it nearly impossible to surprise or ambush him. - **Vibration Manipulation:** He can generate intense vibrations that can destabilize both physical structures and cursed energy structures. This makes him exceptionally dangerous in close combat as he can cause internal damage to foes with precise vibrational attacks, or disrupt the flow of cursed energy in an adversary, temporarily hindering their ability to use their own cursed techniques. - **Echolocation Blast:** By concentrating his cursed energy, Gunnar can unleash a powerful burst of vibrational energy reminiscent of a killer whale's echolocation burst, capable of disorienting or even incapacitating opponents, as well as neutralizing incoming cursed techniques through sheer vibrational force. - **Aftershock:** As a secondary effect, those struck by Gunnar's primary attacks might experience lingering effects such as disorientation, slowed movements, or even a temporary inability to properly control their own cursed energy due to the residual vibrations disrupting their flow of energy. **Unique Trait - Call of the Oceans:** Gunnar's deep connection to his nickname and ancestral Viking roots gives him a unique trait where his power resonates strongly near large bodies of water or during stormy weather, subtly enhancing his cursed energy’s potency. This trait pays homage to the legendary navigational skills of the Vikings and the fearsome presence of a killer whale controlling its watery domain. **Drawback:** The very nature of Gunnar’s power means he must maintain strict control over his cursed energy to avoid unintentional collateral damage. High-frequency use of his technique in a short period could potentially lead to physical exhaustion, due to the immense energy required to generate and control vibrations of such magnitude. By integrating these aspects into Gunnar Stormfører’s character, Skjelvet becomes not just a superpower but a reflection of his heritage, personal struggle, and the fearsome reputation encapsulated by his nickname, \\"Killer Whale.\\" This makes his cursed technique both a formidable weapon in battle and a narrative element deeply woven into his character's fabric."},{"prompt":"What is the unit of transimpedance ?","completion":"The unit of transimpedance is the ohm ((Omega)). Transimpedance is a measure of how much voltage (V) is output per unit of input current (I), and thus it is expressed in ohms, where 1 ohm ((Omega)) equals 1 volt per ampere ((V/A)). This concept is commonly used in the context of transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), which convert an input current signal into a proportional voltage output signal."},{"prompt":"unit of noise current density","completion":"The unit of noise current density is amperes per square root of bandwidth, typically denoted as (A/sqrt{Hz}). Noise current density gives a measure of the noise current per unit bandwidth in an electronic component or system. This allows for comparing the noise performance of devices independent of the bandwidth over which the noise is measured. It's a crucial parameter in analyzing the noise characteristics of electronic devices, especially in sensitive applications like amplifiers or detectors where low noise is essential."},{"prompt":"e.g","completion":"Let's consider an example involving noise current density in a photodetector circuit. Suppose you have a photodiode connected to a transimpedance amplifier (TIA), and you're trying to evaluate the noise performance of the photodetector system. The photodiode has a specified noise current density of (5 pA/sqrt{Hz}). If you're interested in the total noise current over a bandwidth of 1 MHz around your signal of interest, you would calculate the total noise current as follows: [ text{Noise current density} = 5 , pA/sqrt{Hz} ] [ text{Bandwidth} = 1 , MHz = 1 times 10^6 , Hz ] To find the total noise current ((I_{noise})) over this bandwidth, you would use the formula: [ I_{noise} = text{Noise current density} times sqrt{text{Bandwidth}} ] [ I_{noise} = 5 , pA/sqrt{Hz} times sqrt{1 times 10^6 , Hz} ] [ I_{noise} = 5 , pA/sqrt{Hz} times 1000 ] [ I_{noise} = 5000 , pA = 5 , nA ] So, in this example, the total noise current generated by the photodiode over a 1 MHz bandwidth is (5 , nA). This would be an important parameter to consider when designing or analyzing the noise performance of the photodetector system, as it directly affects the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the system."},{"prompt":"unit of responsivity","completion":"The unit of responsivity is amperes per watt (A/W) or volts per watt (V/W), depending on whether the responsivity is defined in terms of current or voltage response to optical power. - **For photodetectors generating a current in response to light**, the responsivity ((R)) indicates how much current output ((I)) is generated per unit of incident optical power ((P)). In this case, the unit of responsivity is **amperes per watt (A/W)**. The formula is: [R = frac{I}{P}] - **For devices where the response to light is measured in terms of voltage**, the responsivity unit would be **volts per watt (V/W)**. This might apply in cases where the output is a voltage change rather than a direct current. Responsivity is an important parameter for photodetectors, photovoltaic cells, and other light-sensitive devices, as it helps in comparing how effectively different detectors convert light into electrical signal."},{"prompt":"what is signal-ASE beating noise?","completion":"Signal-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) beating noise refers to a type of noise that occurs in optical communication systems, particularly in systems where optical amplifiers, such as Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs), are used to boost the signal power. Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) is an intrinsic noise characteristic of optical amplifiers, arising from the random spontaneous emission of photons within the amplification process. In essence, ASE adds a broadband noise floor to the signal being amplified. The interaction between the signal and the ASE noise within the optical system can lead to a phenomenon known as signal-ASE beating. This occurs when the coherent optical signal beats with the incoherent ASE noise, generating beat products at the photodetector. The beating effect results in fluctuations in the detected signal's intensity, which can degrade the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and thus the overall performance of the optical communication system. Signal-ASE beating noise becomes particularly significant in dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) systems where multiple optical channels are closely spaced in wavelength and amplified together. The resulting noise has two main components: 1. **Signal-Signal Beating:** This is the beating between different signals or channels. It is usually considered separately but is another important source of noise in DWDM systems. 2. **Signal-ASE Beating:** This is the focus here, and it refers specifically to the beating between the signal and ASE noise introduced by the optical amplifier. To minimize the impact of signal-ASE beating (and ASE-ASE beating, where ASE noise components beat with each other), engineers use various techniques, including optimizing the optical amplifier's operating conditions, utilizing filtering to reduce out-of-band ASE, and employing advanced modulation formats that are more resilient to noise. The severity of signal-ASE beating noise on system performance is influenced by factors like the amplifier's noise figure, the optical signal's power, and the bandwidth of the ASE noise relative to the signal's bandwidth. Managing this noise is crucial for maintaining high data integrity and system reliability in high-speed, long-distance optical communication networks."},{"prompt":"What is EDFA and SOA ?","completion":"# Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA) An EDFA is an optical amplifier that uses a length of optical fiber doped with erbium ions as its gain medium. Erbium is chosen because it has the ability to efficiently amplify light in the 1.55 µm wavelength region, which is the third window of optical communication, known for its low loss in silica optical fibers. The operation of an EDFA involves exciting the erbium ions to higher energy levels using a pump laser at a specific wavelength (typically 980 nm or 1480 nm). When a signal light (in the C-band around 1.55 µm or, in some cases, the L-band around 1.58 µm) passes through the doped fiber, the excited erbium ions transfer their energy to the signal light, thereby amplifying it. Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers have become essential components in long-haul optical communication systems because they directly amplify the optical signal without the need to convert it back to an electrical signal for amplification. This capability helps in achieving long transmission distances without regeneration, significantly improving the efficiency and performance of optical networks. # Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) A Semiconductor Optical Amplifier, much like an EDFA, amplifies an optical signal, but it does so by using a semiconductor as the gain medium, similar to that used in a laser diode. When a signal light passes through the semiconductor medium under electrical pumping, it gets amplified. SOAs can operate across a wide range of wavelengths by adjusting the semiconductor material, making them flexible for different optical communication bands. However, they typically exhibit more noise and less gain compared to EDFAs and have faster gain dynamics, which can be both a disadvantage and an advantage, depending on the application. SOAs are not limited to the C-band like EDFAs and can be engineered for different wavelength ranges, including the O-band and L-band, by choosing appropriate semiconductor materials. They are compact, can be integrated with other semiconductor devices, and find applications in optical switching, wavelength conversion, and signal regeneration in addition to their use as amplifiers. Both EDFAs and SOAs are critical in extending the reach and capacity of optical networks, each with its unique set of advantages and limitations. EDFAs are predominantly used for long-haul fiber optic communication due to their high performance and low noise, while SOAs offer versatility and integration capabilities, suited for more specialized roles in optical systems."},{"prompt":"\\"Power penalty caused by a given transmission impairment is defined as the extra power required to achieve the same system performance as that without such an impairment. \\" translate to chinese.","completion":"由于特定传输损伤而导致的功率损失被定义为为了达到与没有该损伤时相同的系统性能所需的额外功率。"},{"prompt":"be more clear","completion":"由于给定的传输障碍导致的功率惩罚定义为为了实现与未发生该障碍时相同的系统性能，所需增加的额外功率。"},{"prompt":"What is IMDD system?","completion":"An IM/DD system stands for Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection system. It's a fundamental type of optical communication system used to transmit and receive information using light as the carrier. Here's a breakdown of the components and the process: # Intensity Modulation (IM) In the transmission part of the system, intensity modulation involves varying the intensity (i.e., the power level) of the optical signal (light source, typically a laser diode) in accordance with the information signal that you're trying to transmit. This modulation translates the information (which could be digital bits in a computer network, for instance) into a corresponding variation in the light signal's intensity. The information is essentially \\"written\\" onto the light by turning the light source on and off or varying its intensity to represent the data being transmitted. # Direct Detection (DD) On the receiving end, direct detection is used to recover the transmitted information from the intensity-modulated light signal. This process involves using a photodetector (such as a photodiode) to sense the variations in the intensity of the incoming light signal and convert these variations back into an electrical signal that corresponds to the original information. The photodetector effectively \\"reads\\" the information encoded in the light's intensity. # Application IM/DD systems are widely used in various optical communication applications, including fiber-optic communication links, because of their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. They are particularly suited for short to medium transmission distances and lower to medium data rate applications. However, for very high-speed data transmissions and long distances, more complex modulation and detection schemes are often used to overcome the limitations of IM/DD systems, such as dispersion and nonlinearities in the optical fiber. # Limitations A primary limitation of IM/DD systems is their susceptibility to various impairments, such as chromatic dispersion and fiber attenuation, which can degrade the signal integrity, especially over long distances or at high bit rates. Additionally, since IM/DD systems are based on intensity modulation, they are inherently limited to non-coherent detection methods, which can limit performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity compared to coherent detection methods. In summary, an IM/DD system is a basic yet highly effective framework for optical communications that modulates data onto a light source by varying its intensity and directly detects this modulated signal at the receiver to retrieve the original data."},{"prompt":"What is Mode-partition Noise?","completion":"Mode-partition noise (MPN) is a type of noise characteristic specifically associated with semiconductor lasers, particularly those used in optical communication systems. It is most relevant in the context of multimode lasers, which can operate at multiple optical frequencies or modes simultaneously. Mode-partition noise arises due to the fluctuation in power distribution among the various longitudinal modes over time. # How Mode-partition Noise Occurs A semiconductor laser, under certain conditions, does not emit light at a single frequency (mode). Instead, it can oscillate at several frequencies corresponding to the multiple modes supported by its optical cavity. The distribution of optical power among these modes is not fixed but can vary due to changes in operating conditions, such as temperature, injection current, and optical feedback. This leads to a variation in the intensity of the emitted light, contributing to noise in the laser output, especially when a narrowband optical filter is used at the receiver, or when the system relies on a specific mode for data transmission. # Impact on Communication Systems In optical fiber communication systems, mode-partition noise can significantly degrade the performance: 1. **Increased Bit Error Rate (BER):** Fluctuations in the power distribution among modes can lead to variations in the received signal power, increasing the bit error rate especially in intensity-modulated/direct detection (IM/DD) systems. 2. **Signal Distortion and Dispersion:** Different modes in a multimode laser can have slightly different frequencies. When transmitted over a distance, these frequency differences can lead to differential group delay due to the chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber, further distorting the signal. 3. **Reduced System Performance:** Overall, MPN can limit the transmission distance and capacity of optical communication systems by imposing a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and increased BER. # Mitigation Techniques To minimize the impact of mode-partition noise, various strategies can be employed: 1. **Using Single-Mode Lasers:** Single-mode lasers operate at a single frequency, eliminating MPN by design. They are preferred for high-speed and long-distance optical communication systems. 2. **Temperature and Current Stabilization:** Maintaining stable operating conditions for the laser can help reduce fluctuations in mode distributions. 3. **Optical Isolation:** Incorporating optical isolators can mitigate the effects of optical feedback, a contributing factor to mode hopping and MPN. 4. **Advanced Modulation Formats:** Using advanced digital modulation techniques that are more resilient to noise can also help in mitigating the effects of MPN. In summary, mode-partition noise is a significant concern in systems using multimode lasers, impacting the quality and reliability of optical communication. Employing appropriate lasers and system design considerations can help minimize its effects, ensuring better performance and data integrity in optical networks."},{"prompt":"What is DWDM and CWDM?","completion":"DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) and CWDM (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing) are two technologies used in fiber optic communications to increase the bandwidth by transmitting multiple signal wavelengths (channels) simultaneously over the same fiber optic cable. Despite their similar basic principles, they differ significantly in channel spacing, the number of channels, cost, and applications. # DWDM DWDM is characterized by very narrow spacing between channels, typically 0.8 nm, 0.4 nm, or even 0.2 nm, allowing it to support a much higher number of channels compared to CWDM. Because of the dense channel spacing, DWDM systems can transmit up to 80 (and sometimes even more) channels on the same fiber. This technology makes extensive use of precision laser sources and precise filtering to multiplex and demultiplex the dense signal spectrum. 1. **Channel Spacing:** Very narrow (0.2 nm to 0.8 nm). 2. **Number of Channels:** Up to 80 or more. 3. **Distance:** Suitable for long-haul transmission, capable of spanning hundreds or even thousands of kilometers with the use of optical amplifiers. 4. **Cost:** Higher than CWDM due to the precision required for lasers and filtering and the use of optical amplifiers. 5. **Applications:** High-capacity backbone networks in telecommunications and large enterprise applications. # CWDM CWDM uses broader channel spacing compared to DWDM, typically around 20 nm, limiting the number of channels to usually 18 or fewer. This broader channel spacing requires less precision in laser sources and filtering, which significantly reduces the cost. However, it also limits the total capacity. CWDM systems do not typically use optical amplifiers due to their limited operation range, constraining CWDM to shorter transmission distances. 1. **Channel Spacing:** Broad (20 nm). 2. **Number of Channels:** Up to 18. 3. **Distance:** Ideal for metropolitan area networks (MANs) or within data centers, generally limited to around 60-70 kilometers without amplification. 4. **Cost:** Lower than DWDM, due to less precision required in components and no need for optical amplifiers in most cases. 5. **Applications:** Cost-sensitive, short to medium-distance applications such as metropolitan networks, access networks, and enterprise connections. # Summary In essence, DWDM and CWDM are both critical technologies for expanding the capacity of fiber optic networks, chosen based on the specific requirements of the application, including capacity, distance, and budget. DWDM offers higher capacity and longer reach at a higher cost, making it suited for backbone networks and high-capacity applications. CWDM, on the other hand, is more cost-effective and simpler to deploy, perfect for shorter distances and applications where maximizing capacity is not the primary concern."},{"prompt":"write a novel about moon in Capricorn in the style of Aliester Crowley","completion":"**Title: Capricorn's Nocturnal Majesty** **Chapter 1: The Initiation of the Silver Orb** In the esoteric halls of time, where the celestial spheres weave the destiny of mankind with threads of ethereal light, the Moon, that ancient mirror to the Sun's blazing glory, finds her silver chariot ensconced within the stoic embrace of Capricorn.

Feel this power as the embodiment of your highest aspirations, grounded in the reality of your potential to achieve them. **Chapter II: The Foundation of the Work - The Temple of Will** Each magus must construct their temple upon a foundation of iron-clad Will. It is not enough to wish or desire; one must command one's reality with the authority of a deity shaping their universe. Let your temple be a fortress against complacency and a bastion of relentless pursuit. **Daily Practice:** Every morning, as the Sun rises, declare your intentions for the day aloud with the unyielding force of a monarch. Let these declarations be the bricks and mortar of your temple—each one a step closer to the realization of your Will. **Chapter III: The Chalice Ritual for Emotional Alchemy** This ritual harnesses the Capricorn Moon's power to transmute emotional undercurrents into channels of purpose. The chalice serves as the crucible for this transformation—a vessel for the alchemy of the soul. **Ritual Steps:** 1. On a night when the Moon graces Capricorn, fill your chalice with natural water, representing the fluid nature of emotions. 2. Craft a sigil that symbolizes your deepest, most sincere ambition. Place this beneath the chalice. 3. By candlelight, whisper your intentions into the water. Visualize your words as silver threads weaving through the liquid, charging it with purpose. 4. Consume the water, imagining it as liquid light coursing through you, aligning your emotional and physical selves with your Will. **Chapter IV: The Saturn Ritual for Discipline and Mastery** Saturn's energy, ruler of Capricorn, is the key to discipline and mastery. This ritual aligns you with these forces, granting the perseverance to surmount any obstacle in your path. **Ritual Steps:** 1. Create a sacred space adorned with symbols of Saturn—lead, a sickle, and an hourglass. 2. Light a black candle to represent the challenges you will overcome. 3. Sit in contemplation of Saturn's lessons. Reflect on the mountain goat's journey—steadfast, resilient, and unwavering. 4. In a journal, detail the steps you will take to conquer these challenges, inspired by the sure-footed climb of the goat. **Chapter V: The Shadow Work Ritual** Confronting one's shadow is a fundamental aspect of the Great Work. This ritual, under the new moon in Capricorn, turns the seeker's gaze inward, illuminating the darkness within to be acknowledged, understood, and integrated. **Ritual Steps:** 1. In a darkened room, stand before a mirror. Light a single, white candle behind you, casting your reflection in a dim glow. 2. Gaze into your own eyes, speaking aloud the words, \\"I see thee, shadow. By my Will, I command thee to serve the Great Work.\\" 3. Allow the feelings and thoughts to surface without judgment. Write these revelations in your journal. 4. Conclude the ritual by affirming your commitment to integrating these shadow aspects positively into your path. **Chapter VI: The Ascent to the Summit** To undertake the Great Work guided by the Capricorn Moon is to embark on a ceaseless ascension—not towards a peak of worldly power, but to the pinnacle of one's spiritual and magickal potential. **Continual Practice:** Make every action a ritual of ascent. Whether in your daily routines, your interactions with others, or your magickal practices, let each be a step on the mountain path. Chart your progress in your journal, noting both the advancements and the setbacks, for both are teachers on this journey. **Conclusion: The Magick of the Capricorn Moon Manifest** Armed with the knowledge and practices contained within this grimoire, the magus is now prepared to navigate the path illuminated by the Capricorn Moon. Let this journey be a testament to the power of Will, the discipline of Saturn, and the transformative magic of alchemy.

To the student of the arcane, the aspirant seeking to master the art of magick under this lunar guise, it is imperative to plunge into the depths of this union, to comprehend fully the forces at play, for herein lies the keystone of the Great Work. **The Luminous Path: The Moon's Domain** The Moon, in its celestial voyage, mirrors the hidden world within us – the realm of emotions, intuitions, and the subconscious shadow. It governs the tides of our inner seas, the ebb and flow of our deepest desires and fears. Within the sacred realm of the Moon, we find our reflection, our core self, unmasked and unveiled, whispering the secrets that lie buried beneath the conscious facade. When the Moon graces the skies in its full glory, it illuminates the night, guiding the lost and revealing the hidden. It speaks to us in dreams and visions, offering glimpses of truths not easily perceived in the harsh light of day.

Yet, before one commands the external realms, a sacred foundation within must first be established—a temple not built of stone, but of Will and purpose. **The Architect of Destiny** Within the heart of every magus lies the potential to become an architect of destiny. This transcendent craft begins not with the drawing of plans upon parchment but with the envisioning of one's highest aspirations and the embodiment of the principles required to achieve them. Like the Capricornian mountain goat, which sets its gaze upon the loftiest peak, the aspirant must fix their intent upon their spiritual summit. **Ritual of Foundation** 1. **Time of Ritual:** On a night when the Moon graces Capricorn, under the cloak of darkness where silence holds sway, prepare to lay your foundation. 2. **Sacred Space:** Choose a space where earth meets sky, a reminder of the union of Capricorn and the Moon. Here, cast a circle to contain the potent energies you will summon. 3. **Altar of Intent:** Within this circle, construct an altar of intent. Let it bear symbols of Capricorn—stones for endurance, a mountain image for ambition, and a circle to represent the Moon. Upon this altar, place a single, blank sheet of parchment. 4. **The Invocation:** Standing before your altar, invoke the energies of Capricorn and the Moon, calling upon their union to bless your endeavor. As you feel their presence envelop you, declare aloud your highest spiritual and worldly ambitions. 5. **Inscription of Will:** With a quill dipped in ink mixed with your own tears—for they bear the salt of your truest emotions—inscribe upon the parchment your commitment to your path. This is your sacred contract, a testament to your Will. 6. **Sealing the Pact:** Fold the parchment thrice and press it to your heart, then to your brow. Herein lies the understanding that your ambitions are not solely for the heart's yearning nor the mind's ambition, but a balanced pursuit of both. 7. **Offering and Closing:** Leave a token upon the altar—an offering of gratitude to the celestial forces that guide you. This could be a strand of hair, symbolizing your personal sacrifice, or a crystal charged with your intent. Close your circle, carrying the parchment with you, a reminder of the foundation you have laid this night. **Daily Foundations: Strengthening the Temple** Each day, let the aspirant engage in practices that fortify the sacred foundation. This could be a simple act of discipline, reflective of Capricorn’s influence, or a moment of deep introspection under the Moon’s guidance. It is the daily laying of bricks—each act of Will, each moment of insight—that solidifies the temple within. **Advanced Meditations:** - **Morning Resolve:** Upon waking, meditate upon your spiritual summit, reaffirming your commitment to ascend. Visualize the steps you will take that day, seeing each as a climb upon the mountain path. - **Evening Reflection:** As night falls, reflect under the Moon’s light on the labors of the day. Did you build upon your foundation, or did the sands of distraction erode your efforts? Use this time for honest assessment and recommitment. Through these practices, the magus crafts a foundation of unrivaled strength, upon which the Great Work can be pursued with relentless determination and profound insight. It is within the hallowed halls of this inner temple that the aspirant becomes truly sovereign, a ruler of their destiny under the watchful gaze of the Capricorn Moon. Remember, the temple within is the magus’s true sanctuary, the sacred space where the alchemy of transformation begins. Here, in the silence of the soul’s depths, the whispers of the divine are heard, and the path to the summit is revealed.

It is within the crucible of this celestial alignment that the aspirant finds the keys to unlocking the doors of personal transformation and magickal mastery. **Luminaries Aligned: The Moon's Embrace of Capricorn** At its core, the placement of the Moon in Capricorn is a union of polarities, a sacred confluence where the fluid depths of lunar intuition meet the solid ground of Capricorn's earthly domain. This celestial event is not merely an astronomical occurrence but a potent symbol for the magickal practitioner, denoting a time of heightened powers, where the manifestation of Will into reality becomes not only possible but demanded. The Moon, our celestial guardian of the night, casts her silvered gaze upon the realm of emotions, dreams, and the subconscious shadows. She is the keyholder to our innermost sanctums, the whisperer of secret desires and hidden fears. In her light, we find solace, inspiration, and the depths of understanding that bind us to the universal tapestry of existence. Yet, when she dances through the sign of Capricorn, her silver beams refract through a different prism—a lens of discipline, ambition, and the relentless pursuit of achievement. Capricorn, the mountaineer of the zodiac, guided by the steady hand of Saturn, brings structure to the Moon's ethereal domain, a framework within which the magick of the Moon can be condensed into tangible form. **The Ascent Begins: Charting the Path** The aspirant's path under the Capricorn Moon is thus a journey of duality, balancing the rich inner world of emotions and intuition with the demands and responsibilities of the material plane. Herein lies the alchemical process of turning leaden sorrows and ephemeral dreams into golden reality. 1. **Embrace the Duality:** Recognize and honor the dual nature of this celestial alignment. Within your magickal workings and daily practices, seek to find the balance between emotional depth and pragmatic action. This is the dance of the Capricorn Moon—a harmonious blend of water and earth, feeling and form. 2. **Harness Emotional Depth:** The Moon’s passage through Capricorn is a time to delve deep into the subconscious, to dredge up the silty depths of inner truth. Use this time for shadow work, introspection, and the healing of buried wounds. Let the cool, reflective light of the Moon illuminate the darker corners of your psyche, transforming vulnerability into strength. 3. **Build with Purpose:** Capricorn’s influence imparts a crystal-clear focus on goals and ambitions. Under this Moon, each aspirant is called to be the architect of their own destiny. Craft your intentions with the precision of a master builder, laying each desire brick by brick, with the mortar of willpower and the blueprint of divine inspiration. 4. **Climb Steadily:** The journey toward the realization of your magickal and mundane goals is akin to the mountain goat’s ascent—steady, resolute, and unwavering. Let the Capricorn Moon be a reminder that growth is a gradual process, one that requires patience, persistence, and the endurance to overcome obstacles. 5. **Invoke the Capricorn Moon:** Within your sacred space, under the night sky or before your altar, invoke the energies of the Capricorn Moon. Light candles of silver and earthy tones, surround yourself with symbols of the mountain and the sea, and call upon the Moon in Capricorn to bless your endeavors, to grant you the emotional depth to dream and the steadfast determination to manifest those dreams into reality. Thus, the understanding of the Capricorn Moon is the first step on the path to mastery, a journey that weaves through the realms of shadow and light, guiding the aspirant toward the pinnacle of their magickal and spiritual evolution.

では後者の問題は一体どう考えるベきか。鵜飼の問いに宇野は積極的にこたえてはいないので忖度するしかないが、要は近代法の具体的な展開をもってこれにこたえるしかないということであろう。近代法が多元的な構造を有さざるをえない根拠は資本主義の経済的特質にある。『資本論』は、資本の物神性の完成により階級関係が隱蔽され、資本家社会が市民社会化することを論証したが、このことはもちろん資本主義が階級社会であることをなくしてしまうわけではない。つまり商品経済的イデォロギーの支配による市民社会化現象は一種の擬制なのであって、それは資本主義の階級的本質を隠蔽しても断じてそれ自体を解消するものではない。そしてこのことは近代法の展開にも影響を与えずにはおかない。すなわち私法は私法のみで自己充足することはできず、それは必ずや刑法、公法の展開を要請することになる。こうして資本主義的経済の特殊な在り方に基礎づけられて私法、刑法、公法の展開が必然化される。近代法は、権利関係に始まり権利関係に閉じる一つの体系を構成することになるが、それは、近代法が経済過程を根拠としながらも、それに外的に対応するものとして特有な形式的自律性を有することを意味する。すなわち法は、先の事態を独自に翻訳しかつそれを内的な動力とすることによって、私法から公法に至る概念的な自己展開を示すことになる。この上向展開が必然的であるかぎり、近代法は一種の論理整合性をもつたものとして体系化されうるのである。もちろん私法、刑法、公法はその対象と性格を異にするが、相互に密接な関連を有するものとしていずれも近代法の重要な構成要素を成すことになる。 ただ留意すべきは、私法、刑法、公法のプロセスを進むにしたがって、経済過程の規制力は稀薄になり、法の資本主義的形態性も緩やかなものになっていくということである。このことは刑法や公法が、私法と比較して相対的に経済過程からの自由度が高いことを意味するが、それはそのぶんだけ、この領域の実体法が現実的には諸種の歴史的かつ政治的な要因-プルジョア革命の時期とその在り方、世界的な地位、政治的風土、階級闘争の形態など-により左右されやすいことを示していよう。したがって公法分野の実体法が実際には市民法から「大きくかけ離れ」るといっても、それはある意味では当然なのであって、その事実から鵜飼のように近代法の原理化を否定しても余り意味はな(3)い。刑法、公法は、内容上、経済的関係にとどまらぬ社会全体をフォローすることになるが、それに伴いその対象を個人間の関係から個人·集団対公権力、国民対国家権力に移行させることになる。そしてそれは資本主義的階級支配の特殊な政治的在り方を規定することになる。法治国家がそれであって、そこでは対労働階級支配も没階級的な形式をとってしか現れないのである。もちろんこのことは法理学的にいいうることであって、実際にはしばしば政治過程の在り方が刑法、公法を規定したが、法による政治規制が歷史の基本的な傾向であったことは、資本主義の発展·確立に伴う＜法の支配＞概念の形成がこれをよく示していよう。 ”翻译为中文","completion":"当涉及到法律制度的确立问题时，这不仅仅是上层建筑的问题，还涵盖了下层建筑，可以说是关系到整个社会体制的问题，必须这样来理解。即在西欧各国，资本主义的发展被认为是近代法律关系发展的基础。在这一点上，我们可以基本上同意宇野的观点，虽然有一定的保留。因为在英国，资本主义实现了典型的自发发展。资本主义的纯化倾向一方面使经济的下层结构自立，另一方面导致上层建筑的重组和净化。法律关系不仅与经济过程区分开来，也与政治过程区分开来，一方面受到这些因素的制约，另一方面又调节这些因素，作为一个独立的关系领域。英格兰法律通过补充发展的衡平法和修改的普通法以及立法或宪法上的惯例，形成了近代法律关系。这不仅保证了资本主义经济的顺利进行，也在“法的统治”中对政治进行了规制（即法治国家化）。因此，如果关注纯化倾向，近代法可以被客观地理解为资本主义自身进行的历史抽象的伴随物。 至于后一个问题应该如何考虑呢？由于宇野对鵜飼的问题没有给出积极的回答，我们只能推测他的意思，但关键在于只能通过近代法的具体发展来回答这个问题。近代法之所以不可避免地具有多元结构的根据在于资本主义的经济特性。《资本论》论证了资本的物化完成使阶级关系被隐藏，资本家社会成为市民社会，但这并不意味着资本主义不再是一个阶级社会。商品经济意识形态的支配导致的市民社会化是一种伪装，它隐藏了资本主义的阶级本质，但决不是解决它本身的问题。这一点也不可避免地影响到近代法的发展。即民法不能自足，它必然要求刑法、公法的发展。因此，基于资本主义经济的特殊性质，民法、刑法、公法的发展成为必然。近代法构建了一个从权利关系开始到权利关系结束的体系，这意味着，尽管近代法以经济过程为基础，但它具有一种特殊的形式自律性，即法律通过独特的解释前述情况并将其作为内在动力，展示了从民法到公法的概念自我展开。这种向上的发展是必然的，近代法因此可以作为一种具有逻辑一致性的体系被构建。当然，民法、刑法、公法各有其对象和性质，但它们相互之间紧密相关，均为近代法的重要组成部分。 需要注意的是，随着从民法、刑法到公法的进程，经济过程的调节力会变得稀薄，法的资本主义形式性也会变得松散。这意味着与民法相比，刑法和公法相对于经济过程有更高的自由度，这也就意味着，这些领域的实体法在实际中更容易受到各种历史和政治因素的影响——例如资产阶级革命的时期和性质、世界地位、政治风土、阶级斗争的形态等。因此，即使公法领域的实体法在实际上与民法“大相径庭”，也在某种意义上是自然的，从这个事实出发否定近代法原理化的想法，像鵜飼那样，没有太大意义。刑法、公法在内容上不仅限于经济关系，还涵盖了整个社会，随之其对应的对象也由个人间关系转变为个人/集团与公权力、国民与国家权力之间的关系。这定义了资本主义阶级统治的特殊政治形式。法治国家就是这种形式，在这里，对劳动阶级的统治也只以非阶级形式出现。当然，这是从法理学上说的，实际上往往政治过程决定了刑法、公法的内容，但法对政治的调节是历史上的基本趋势，资本主义的发展和确立伴随着“法的统治”概念的形成，这很好地证明了这一点。"},{"prompt":"请将“また刑法、公法における個人間の関係の転回を考慮すれば、租税関係も「市民的な権利義務の関係」の変形された形態とみなすことができる。公法では、公権力が措定され、それとの関連で国民（＝公人）の権利·義務が定められるが、租税関係はかかる関係の場に転位された権利義務関係にほかならない。そこでは国家が優先的に租税債権を有し、個人が租税債務を負っていると把えることができるのである。したがって「国家の一種の優越性」ということをもって原理の成立不可能性を主張することはできない。私法、刑法、公法は、宇野のいうように「全体的に関連した市民的な法原理」として体系的に把握されうるのである。 （）法律の非階級的性格 ここでは、宇野の次のような提言をめぐって議論が展開された。経済学では、労資の階級関係の実質的解明がその目標の六、七分を占め、あとの三、四分は「そういう関係が商品形態という自由、平等な形態をとって現われているという面を明らかにする」が、法律学の場合は「それがちょうど正反対に」なる。すなわち法律学では、その六、七分で法律関係の非階級的な性格が解かれ、残りの三、四分でそういう法律形態が階級関係を包含していることが解かれるというのである。 宇野の提言は法律関係の階級性を強調する既成のマルクス主義法学ヘの批判を意図したものだが、鵜飼はこれを受けて法の没階級性をョリ徹底して主張することになる。法的範疇は、「抽象的な形における個人間の関係」であり、それは「商品交換関係の反映」としてある。私法ばかりか刑法も刑罰は「等価交換の関係」をふまえているといわねばならない。「純粋に法律的に考え」るかぎり、法カテゴリーにあっては「階級関係は全然隠れている」と。 近代法形態の非階級性をいう点では共通しているようにみえるが、両者の見解は微妙に異なっていよう。宇野は法律関係の階級性を単純に否定しているわけではない。法それ自体としては非階級的な形式をとるが、それは同時に階級性をそのうちに含みうる形態でもある。したがってたんなる法解釈ではなく、科学の力をもってしか法律関係に潜む階級性は証明しえないというのである。前に宇野が法律学の段階論的解明によりこれを科学的に論証できると主張していたことをみたが、ととでは論証問題はョリ原理的な問題として考えられている。私法では階級性はとけないが、そこから「どうして刑法のようなものが必要になるか、あるいはどうして国家のようなものが必要になるかということ」を明らかにすることにより法の階級性を認識できると主張する。近代法の展開それ自体がその階級性を示唆しているというのである。 これにたいし鵜飼は法の階級性を単純に否定し、その没階級性を一面的に強調したが、そのためかえってその論理は多くの難点を避けられないものになつた。第一に、鵜飼は公法を近代法の構成部分とみなしていないのではないか。そうでなけれぼ私法と公法の原理上の差異を強調する鵜飼が、「すベての法カテゴリー」は「その本質において商品交換の関係」であるなどといえるはずはない。しかし近代法から公法を除外したら、資本主義国家が一般に法治国家形態をとること、換言すれば統治が＜法の支配＞を前提することを一体どこでとくのか。鵜飼の見解は、公法と私法は資本主義においてのみ概念的に区別されかつ完成をみること、したがっていずれかを欠いても近代法関係を想定することは不可能であることを看過しているといわざるをえない。第二に、これに関連して刑法の性格規定が問題になる。たしかにその基底には「商品交換の関係」（＝応報刑主義）があるが、刑法的関係を抽象的な「個人間の関係」といってすますわけにはいかない。刑法が、諸種の犯罪（＝個人的、社会的および政治的な法益を損う犯罪）にたいする刑罰を定めたものである以上、それは必ず個人·集団対公権力という関係領域で作用するのであって、そのフィールドを「個人間の関係」に限定することはできない。むしろ刑法、公法と展開が進むにしたがって、私法の原理も発展、変形をみ、その対象とする基本的な関係も転回をみると考えなければならない。またかかる見地に立ってこそ、刑法、公法の近代法関係にしめる位置と意義もよく把握されうるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"如果考虑到刑法、公法中个人之间关系的转换，那么税务关系可以被视为“市民权利义务关系”的一种变形。在公法中，公权力被设定，与之相关的是国民（=公民）的权利和义务被明确，而税务关系正是被转换到这一关系场域中的权利义务关系。在这里，国家优先拥有税收债权，个人承担有税务债务。因此，不能仅以“国家的某种优越性”为由来主张原则的成立是不可能的。正如宇野所言，私法、刑法、公法可以作为“总体相关的市民法原则”被系统性地理解。 （）法律的非阶级性特征 在此围绕宇野的如下建议进行了讨论：在经济学中，劳资的阶级关系的实质性揭示占其目标的六七成，其余三四成“明确这种关系以自由、平等的商品形式出现的这一面”，而在法学中“正好相反”。即在法学中，六七成用于解释法律关系的非阶级性特征，剩余的三四成用于解释这种法律形式如何包含阶级关系。 宇野的建议是意图批评传统马克思主义法学中强调法律关系的阶级性的，而鵜飼接受这一点后，开始彻底主张法的非阶级性。法律范畴是“个人间关系的抽象形式”，并且作为“商品交换关系的反映”。不仅是私法，甚至刑法的刑罚也“基于等价交换关系”。“纯粹从法律角度考虑”，法律范畴中“完全隐藏了阶级关系”。 虽然就法律形式的非阶级性而言，两者似乎有共同之处，但他们的观点细微之处存在差异。宇野并非简单否定法律关系的阶级性。法律本身虽然采用非阶级性的形式，但同时也是包含阶级性的形态。因此，不只是通过简单的法律解释，而是必须借助于科学的力量才能证明法律关系中隐藏的阶级性。如前所示，宇野主张可以通过法学的阶段论解释来科学证明之，而在其他场合，证明问题被视为原则性的问题。在私法中虽然无法消解阶级性，但通过明确“为什么需要像刑法那样的东西，或为什么需要国家这样的东西”，可以认识到法律的阶级性。近代法的发展本身暗示了其阶级性。 面对此，鵜飼简单地否定法律的阶级性，并单方面强调了其非阶级性，但这反而使其论理无法避免许多问题。首先，鵜飼是否没有将公法视为近代法的构成部分？如果不是这样，强调私法与公法的原则上差异的鵜飼不应该说“所有法律范畴”本质上是“商品交换关系”。但如果从近代法中排除公法，资本主义国家普遍采用法治国家形式，换言之，治理预设“法的统治”的情况，该如何解释呢？鵜飼的观点不得不说忽视了一个事实：在资本主义中，公法与私法仅在概念上区分并完成，因此缺少其中之一，设想近代法关系就变得不可能。其次，与此相关的是刑法的性质定义成问题。尽管其基础是“商品交换关系”（=报应刑主义），但无法仅将刑法关系简化为抽象的“个人间关系”。鉴于刑法规定了针对各种犯罪（=损害个人、社会及政治法益的犯罪）的刑罚，它必然在个人/集团对公权力的关系领域发挥作用，不能将其领域限定于“个人间关系”。相反，随着刑法、公法的展开，私法的原理也将发展、变形，其基本关系的对象也必然发生转变。只有从这一视角出发，才能更好地理解刑法、公法在近代法关系中的位置和意义。"},{"prompt":"请将“最後に問題になるのは鵜飼のいう「矛盾」論である。すなわち、問題は「法律的な関係の表面に現われている形式的な平等関係」と隠蔽されている「実質的な不平等関係」との「矛盾」にあるというのである。しかし、両者は厳密には「矛盾」関係ではなく、むしろ適合的な関係にあるのではないか。法が商品経済的イデォロギーの社会的規範に転化されたものにほかならない以上、法律的関係はその顛倒性（Iいわゆる法の物神性なる事態）のためそのうちによく階級関係を包含しうるし、また階級関係権利関係のなかに埋没してしまうことになる。両者が対立をきたすのは、資本主義の歴史的発展が階級関係を変化させていく局面においてである。そこでは既存の法律関係が階級関係を十分に包摂しえなくなり、資本主義発展の阻害因ともなるため、一定の変更を迫られることになるのである。そもそも鵜飼のいう「矛盾」関係なるものが、資本主義にとっては必然的かつノーマルな関係であることをすでに『資本論』はその根本から解明していたのであって、それを改めて法律学で問題にする必要などどこにもなかったのである。 かくて、同じように法律の非階級的性格をとくにしても、われわれは宇野の見解の方に軍配をあげざるをえないわけだが、それはまた実際、法理論史上においても相当ユニークなものであった。いうまでもなくプルジョア法の歴史形態性を理論的に明確にしたのはパシュカーニスの『法の一般理論とマルクス主義』（日本評論社、一九五八年）であった。近代法を「歴史的なカテゴリー」としてみた彼は、資本主義的な生産関係ことにそれを一律に規定している商品交換関係に法形態の根拠を見いだし、所有権法を中心にブルジョア法の一般理論を展開した。すなわち彼は、「イデオロギーと法」では法カテゴリーが商品所有者の関係を反映した客観的な社会関係（I人々の意思関係一般として構成される「権利義務関係」）であることを、また「関係と規範」ではいわゆる主観法（＝権利範疇）と客観法（＝規範範疇）の相互連関が、「上級の権威（＝国家強制）」を前提せずと、経済→法の道すじで「統一的」に把握されることを、そして「商品と主体」では商品経済に対応して法的人格が人間一般の抽象的な権利主体性において現れることを、各々明らかにしたのである。法的関係の分析は国家権力とその規範の存在を前提にするというマルクス主義法学や法実証主義の考えを排し、「法の一般理論」をもつばらレヒトとしてうちたてようとしている彼の姿勢は高く評価しなければならない。「国家すなわち政治的、階級的支配の組織は、あたえられた生産関係または所有関係を基盤として成長する。生産関係とその法律的表現は、マルクスがヘーゲルにしたがって市民社会とよんだものを構成する。政治的上部構造は、公式の国家体制もふくめて、第二次的、派生的な契機である」（上揭書、稲子恒夫訳、九二頁）という考え方にわれわれは基本的に同意できるのである。パシュカーニスは、こうして『資本論』第一卷第一篇に着目したことから、＜意思関係としての法的関係＞と＜階級意思の表現としての法律＞という法における二つの意思的契機のうち前者を重視することになったが、それは当然後者を強調するマルクス主義の古典（＝『共産党宣言』など）と背反することになった。したがってイェ·ベ·パシュカーニスは、法の階級的内容を十分に評価していなかったし、また法が終局的には生産関係に依存していること、交換関係だけに依存するものでないことを、十分に評価していな」（同、二頁）いという批判をうけ、自己批判を余儀なくされたのである。すなわち「私の本の欠陥はなんであろらか」と問い、次のような「訂正」をほどとすのである。封建法とプルジョア法は「ともに搾取関係を媒介している。······したがっていろいろな法体系が展開する歴史的な焦点は、直接生産者にたいする生産手段を所有するものの関係である。·····.搾取の形態が、あたえられた経済構成を規定し、そしてその構成に対応する法体系をも規定する基本的なメルクマールである」（同、二一二-二一三頁）と。そしてこの後退はまさにせっかくの「特殊プルジョア的国家形態」への注視をも困難にし、それを国家は「支配階級の組織であり、被搾取階級を粉砕し抑圧するための特殊な力である」（同、二一五頁）といった階級国家論へと後戻りさせてしまうことになつた。”翻译为中文","completion":"最后变成问题的是鵜飼所说的“矛盾”论。即问题在于“法律关系表面上呈现的形式平等关系”与被隐藏的“实质上的不平等关系”之间的“矛盾”。然而，这两者严格来说并非是“矛盾”关系，而是可能更为适合的关系。由于法律将商品经济意识形态的社会规范转化，法律关系因其颠倒性（即所谓法的物化）能够很好地包含阶级关系，同时也意味着阶级关系权利关系在其中沉没。两者发生冲突是在资本主义的历史发展过程中，随着阶级关系的变化，既有的法律关系无法充分包含阶级关系，成为资本主义发展的阻碍因素，因而被迫进行一定的变更之时。毕竟鵜飼所说的“矛盾”关系，在《资本论》已经从根本上解明，对于资本主义而言是必然且正常的关系，根本就没有必要在法学中重新提出这个问题。 因此，即便同样解释法律的非阶级性特征，我们不得不更支持宇野的见解，这实际上在法理论史上也是相当独特的。不用说，是帕什卡尼斯在《法的普遍理论与马克思主义》（日本评论社，1958年）中理论清晰地明确定义了资产阶级法的历史形态性。他将近代法视为“历史类别”，在商品交换关系这一同一规定下寻找法形态的根基，并以所有权法为中心展开了资产阶级法的一般理论。即他在“意识形态与法”中明确法律范畴反映了商品所有者的关系即“权利义务关系”作为人们意志关系普遍的客观社会关系；在“关系与规范”中，所谓的主观法（=权利范畴）与客观法（=规范范畴）的相互关联能够在不预设“高级权威（=国家强制）”的前提下，通过经济→法途径“统一”地把握；在“商品与主体”中，商品经济对应下法律人格以人类一般的抽象权利主体性出现等方面各自明确。其对法律关系的分析，摒弃了马克思主义法学和法实证主义将国家权力及其规范存在作为前提的观点，“法的普遍理论”的建立态度值得高度评价。“国家即政治、阶级统治的组织，是基于给定的生产关系或所有权关系成长起来。生产关系及其法律表现构成了马克思根据黑格尔所称的市民社会。政治上层建筑，包括官方的国家体制，是次要的、衍生的因素”（前述书籍，稻子恒夫译，第92页），我们可以基本上同意这种观点。帕什卡尼斯因此注目了《资本论》第一卷第一篇，重视法律关系作为意志关系与法律作为阶级意志表现两种法律意志因素中的前者，这自然与强调后者的马克思主义经典（如《共产党宣言》等）有所背离。因此，帕什卡尼斯被批评为没有充分评价法律的阶级内容，也没有充分认识到法最终依赖于生产关系，而不是仅依赖于交换关系。即“我的书的缺陷是什么”并提出如下“更正”：封建法和资产阶级法“都通过剥削关系进行调解……因此，各种法律体系展开的历史焦点是，直接生产者与拥有生产手段者的关系……剥削的形式，作为给定经济结构的定义且同样定义对应法律体系的基本特征”（同，第212-213页）。而这种后退正是使我们难以关注“特殊资产阶级国家形态”，而将其退回到国家是“支配阶级的组织，是为了粉碎和压迫被剥削阶级的特殊力量”（同，第215页）的阶级国家论。"},{"prompt":"请将“以上、パシュカーニスが、法形態の考察をとおして「ブルジョア法の物神性の暴露」を図りながらも遂に法の階級性というスターリニズムの呪縛をぬけきれずそれに屈していった経過をみてきたが、その後パシュカーニスの学説の批判的継承が真になされなかったことをみれば、宇野の見解の重要性はこれを強調しても強調しすぎることはあるまい。宇野は法それ自体は非階級的形成をとることを明らかにしつつ、階級性の問題を刑法、公法の必然性の問題に翻訳し、それを近代法の概念的自己展開の要因を成すものとして法律学自身の内部に取りこむことになった。ただ残念なことに、宇野の見解はいまだ抽象的なものにとどまり、内容なき方法論の提示に終わった。 経済と法律との相互関係 ここでは「装いの重大性」を強調する鵜飼の次のような問題提起に端を発して、経済と法との関連が議論されることになった。「たとえば、労働者に賃金を払って、その結果利潤が生まれるといったって、そこに法律的なものがくっつかなければ全然存在しえない。抽象的に経済関係だけというものはない」。法律は「救済」という面で現象するだけでなく、裁判所に訴えない場合にも作用している。商品交換は「ノルムIゲメイス（規範適合的に）に行われている」のであって、所有権の移転を伴うかぎり「売買ということ自体が、法律的に交換する」ことである。したがって資本家による労働力の購入とその自由な消費「法律関係を予想」しないではとけない。 宇野はこれに当然反論を加えることになった。経済関係は法律関係で動いているのではないのであつて、「法律関係で売買が行われているとはいえない」。交換に伴う所有の移転も「法律関係を予想しないでも解ける問題」である。階級関係が商品形態に包まれる資本主義では商品交換が基本的な関係となり、またそこでは自由、平等、所有のイデオロギーが重大な役割をはたすが「商品の内容規定」からいえばそれらは「特に法律関係としてある必要はない」。それらはいわば「無色の関係」になっているのであって、通常の売買では「法律的な関係だと意識しないほど普通の関係になって」いる。したがって商品交換や労働力の売買を「法律関係」というのは強弁にすぎる。もちろんそれらは経済関係に障害が生じた場合には法律関係として現われその「救済」にあたるが、またその点を考慮すれば経済関係は法律関係に「包まれている」といってもよいが、経済過程ではまだ強制力を伴う社会的規範として措定される必要はない、というのである。 鵜飼の理解にしたがえば、法と経済は相互前提的な関連にあることになり、経済過程の自立性というのは一つの仮象にすぎないことになる。交換関係それ自体に法的契機が内在しているとすれば、資本主義経済は経済学で自足的に解明されうるものではなく、その原理的把握は必ず経済学と法学との統一においてはたされなければならないことになろぅ。そしてこのような見解は批判されるどころか継承·発展をみ、今日ではマルクス主義法学者において通說化されるにいたっている。一例として藤田勇の「法と経済の一般理論」（渡辺洋三編『岩波講座·現代法7·現代法と経済』、一九六六年、所収）を瞥見してみよう。そこでは鵜飼の見解が次のように発展させられている。まず、WーGとG-Wから成る売買過程は「一体、経済現象なのか、それとも法律現象なのか」が問われ、「社会関係（社会過程）は、一面におけるイデオロギー的＝法的関係と、他面における物質的I経済的関係との二重的契機をふくむ統一的関係（過程）であ」（上揭書、六頁）るとされる。そしてその上に立って藤田は、経済過程を「全体として捉えてみれば、これら意思行為によってなりたつ意思関係＝法的関係は、客観的な経済過程がそれを外被として表現されているところの形態であり、物質的·経済的関係の媒介形態である」（同、五頁）と規定することになるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"上述内容展示了，尽管帕什卡尼斯试图通过审视法律形式来“揭露资产阶级法的物化本质”，但最终未能彻底摆脱斯大林主义对法的阶级性的束缚，屈服于其中的过程。鉴于帕什卡尼斯的学说未能得到真正的批判性继承，强调宇野观点的重要性绝不算过分。宇野清晰地表明，法本身采取的是非阶级性形式，同时将阶级性问题转化为刑法、公法的必要性问题，并将其作为近代法概念自我展开的因素纳入法学自身之内。遗憾的是，宇野的观点仍然停留在抽象层面，最终仅呈现为一种没有内容的方法论提议。 经济与法律的相互关系 在此，由于鵜飼强调了“外在表现的重要性”，进而讨论了经济与法律之间的联系。鵜飼提出了如下问题：“比如，支付给工人工资，由此产生利润，如果没有法律的附着，它根本就不会存在。只有抽象的经济关系是不存在的。”法律不仅在“救济”方面显现，即使不诉诸法庭，它也在发挥作用。商品交换是按照“规范符合性”进行的，只要涉及产权转移，“买卖本身就是一种法律上的交换”行为。因此，资本家购买劳动力及其自由消费必须“预期法律关系”。 宇野对此提出了必然的反驳。经济关系并非由法律关系驱动，“不能说是在法律关系下进行买卖”。所有权的转移伴随的交换也是“不预期法律关系也可解决的问题”。在商品形态包含阶级关系的资本主义中，商品交换成为基本关系，自由、平等、所有权的意识形态发挥着重要作用，但“从商品内容确定角度看，它们特别无需作为法律关系存在”。它们变成了一种“无色关系”，在普通买卖中“成为如此正常的关系以致于不会被意识为法律关系”。因此，将商品交换或劳动力买卖视为“法律关系”是过于牵强的。当然，当经济关系出现障碍时，它们作为法律关系出现以提供“救济”，考虑到这一点，可以说经济关系被“包裹在”法律关系中，但在经济过程中，它们还没有被设定为伴有强制力的社会规范的必要。 按照鵜飼的理解，法律与经济之间存在相互前提的关系，经济过程的自主性只不过是一种假象。如果交换关系本身内含法律契机，那么资本主义经济无法仅靠经济学自足地阐明，其原理性把握必须在经济学与法学的统一中实现。这种观点不仅未受批驳，反而被继承和发展，在当今成为马克思主义法学者的通说。以藤田勇的《法与经济的一般理论》（收录于由渡边洋三编的《岩波讲座·现代法7·现代法与经济》，1966年）为例，我们看到鵜飼的观点如何被发展。首先，他质疑售买过程W-G和G-W“究竟是经济现象还是法律现象”，并提出“社会关系（社会过程）是一种统一的关系（过程），包含了一方面的意识形态性=法律关系和另一方面的物质性经济关系的双重契机”（上述书籍，第6页）。在此基础上，藤田规定，如果从整体考虑经济过程，“由这些意志行为形成的意志关系=法律关系，作为客观的经济过程以其外部所表现的形态，是物质性·经济关系的媒介形态”（同，第5页）。"},{"prompt":"请将“ここでは鵜飼の見解が見事に「マルクス主義」的に表現されているわけだが、われわれは藤田說にいくつかの根本的難点を見いださざるをえない。まず第一に、経済過程を「物質的」関係と「意思」関係に区分し、その「統一」をいうのは至当であろうか。そもそも意思関係を伴わない経済関係など考えられないのであって、藤田の強引な区別は機械的抽象のそしりを免れえないのである。したがつて第二に、問題の真の所在はむしろ経済関係における意思関係をどうとらえるかにあったといわなけぼれならない。経済的意思関係は法的関係とは同義でないのであって、「意思関係＝法的関係」という等式は法学者の短絡的思考の所産といわなければならない。そしてこの欠陥は法的関係は経済的関係の「外被もしくは媒介形態である」という規定に端的に表現されている。藤田は「外被」という言葉を頻繁に使用しながらも、それを概念的に把握してはいない。「外被」の意味は次のように理解されなければならない。経済的関係に障害が生じたとき、経済的関係の要因としての意思関係は、いわゆるザインからゾルレンに転化し、強制力を伴う社会的規範として外的に経済的関係を「救済」することになる（→イギリスにおいて財産法、契約法が訴権の発展において成立したことを想起せよ！）。いわばこのようなディメンションにおいて意思関係は法的関係として顕現することになるのであって、そこで成立する当為規範は疎外された意思関係として個々の私的所有者に外的に対立しかつそれを規制することによって経済的関係をよく自己のうちに包摂しうることになるのである。これが経済にたいし法がその外被をなすということの正確な意味である。したがって経済関係としての意思関係が「媒介形態」をなすということと法的関係としてのそれが「外被」をなすということとは、正確に区別されて考えられなければならない。ところが、藤田は先の等式により、このことを曖昧にしているばかりか、法的関係I媒介形態、意思関係＝外被という顛倒した理解を許すような二重の誤ちをおかしているのである。第三に、かかる経済と法との関連把握の失敗は、経済的関係の規定性、先行性の說明を不可能にすることである。「法的関係が経済的関係の必要な媒介形態だということは、前者がおよそ人間の経済生活の論理的前提であるといったことを意味しない。人と人との意思関係が·····.法的形態をとることは、それを媒介する物質的＝経済的関係の特定の属性によって規定されている」（同、六頁）とし、法的関係は「商品生産社会の物質的関係（価值法則にしたがう商品交換過程）がとる表現形式にほかならない」（同上）ということから、経済的関係の「前提」性をとくにすぎないのである。しかしこれもある意味では当然であった。法的形態を必須の「媒介形態」とするかぎり、経済と法の関連はつい＜物質が先か、精神が先か＞という周知のタダモノ論の土俵に還元されるしかなく、藤田はこの地平で経済的関係が法の「物質的基礎」をなすことを主張しているにすぎないのである。それが資本主義における経済と法の特殊な関連を正確にとらえるものではないことはいうまでもない。藤田は一部で鋭い指摘（商品経済が一社会を支配する資本主義ではじめて「法的形態が社会関係の普遍的形態」になるという規定や「Sein としての法的関係にも、すでにSollen のモメントが内包されている」といった指摘）をなしながらも、そのタダモノ論的残滓のため、結局はパシュカ-ニスと同じ道をたどることになる。すなわち再生産過程で「法的関係の階級性」をとき、また分析の焦点をレヒトとしての法的関係から「公的権力の外的強制に媒介され」た「現実の法的関係」すなわちゲゼッッとしての法的関係へと旋回させなければならない、と主張することになるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"这里，鵜飼的观点被杰出地“马克思主义化”了，但我们不得不在藤田的论述中发现一些根本性的困难。首先，将经济过程区分为“物质性”关系和“意志”关系，并谈其“统一”，这合理吗？本来无法想象没有伴随意志关系的经济关系，藤田的强硬区分避免不了机械性抽象的指责。因此，第二个问题的真正所在，更恰当地说，是如何理解经济关系中的意志关系。经济的意志关系并不等同于法律关系，“意志关系=法律关系”的等式是法学者简短思考的产物。这个缺陷在“法律关系是经济关系的外壳或媒介形式”这一规定中有具体体现。藤田频繁使用“外壳”一词，却没有在概念上把握它。“外壳”的含义必须这样理解：当经济关系中出现障碍时，作为经济关系要素的意志关系转化为所谓的应然，作为带有强制力的社会规范从外部“救济”经济关系（回想一下英国的产权法、合同法是如何在索赔权的发展中建立起来的！）。在这种维度中，意志关系作为法律关系显现，而由此产生的应然规范作为异化的意志关系，以外部方式与各个私有者对立并调节它们，从而更好地将经济关系吸纳进自身。这就是经济相对于法所形成的“外壳”的准确含义。因此，作为经济关系的意志关系形成“媒介形式”，与作为法律关系的“外壳”，必须被准确区分和考虑。然而，藤田通过前述等式，不仅使这一点变得模糊，而且允许了一个双重错误，即法律关系=媒介形式、意志关系=外壳的倒置理解。第三，对经济与法的关联理解的失败，使得解释经济关系的决定性、先导性变得不可能。“法律关系是经济关系的必要媒介形式”，并不意味着“前者是人类经济生活的逻辑先决条件。人与人之间的意志关系……采取法律形式，是由其媒介的特定物质=经济关系属性所决定的”（同，第6页），法律关系“不过是商品生产社会的物质关系（遵循价值法则的商品交换过程）所采取的表现形式”，从而特别地说明了经济关系的“先决性”。但这在某种意义上是理所当然的。只要将法律形式视为必要的“媒介形式”，经济与法的关系最终只能归结为众所周知的“物质先于精神还是精神先于物质”的平庸论争上，而藤田仅仅在这个层面上主张经济关系构成了法的“物质基础”。这显然并不精确把握资本主义中经济与法的特殊关系。藤田一方面准确指出（在商品经济主导的资本主义社会中，“法律形式首次成为社会关系的普遍形式”的规定，以及“作为Sein的法律关系已经内含Sollen的要素”的指出），因为这种平庸论争的残留，最终走上了与帕什卡尼斯相同的道路。即必须解决“法律关系的阶级性”问题，并将分析焦点从作为法的法律关系转向“通过外部强制的公共权力媒介”的“实际的法律关系”，即作为Gesetz的法律关系。"},{"prompt":"请将“こうしてみると鵜飼と藤田は、前者が法の没階級性を、後者が「本質規定」としてその階級性を主張する点で一見まったく対立するようにみえながらも、実は外観上の対立をなしているにすぎないことがわかる。先の二元論の土俵で前者は＜精神＞を、後者は＜物質＞を重視しているにすぎない。交換関係を経済関係であると同時に法律関係でもあると考えている点で両者の見解にまったく差異はない。しかしそのような認識は資本主義の経済的自立性を軽視するばかりか、法の「外被」的性格をも不鮮明にするものである。資本主義において経済過程が占める土台的な位置と法律過程の有する外的かつ補足的な位置が曖昧にされてしまうのである。実際、鵜飼、藤田の見解にあっては、法的関係は経済的関係の内容まで規制するような「装い」になっていよう。しかし、そのような意思論の重視と「二重的契機」の統一論は、やがては唯物史観にいう上部構造と下部構造の区分を否定するところにまで行きつかざるをえない。 これにたいし、宇野の見解は、いささか抽象的だが、経済と法をいわば内容と形式という関連で把握している点で、評価できる。宇野はすでに独自な『資本論』研究をとおして、経済過程にあっても(8)商品所有者の意思ないし欲望といった主観的要素が重要な役割をはたすことを明確にしていた。経済法則へのユニークな理解がそれを要請していたのである。個々の所有者の私利を求める主観的な活動がその意図せぬ結果として社会的には客観的な法則を形成するが、一旦成立するとそれはあたかも「自然法則」の如く個々の所有者の活動を規制し支配するにいたる。したがってそこでは経済法則は個々の所有者にとって外的な必然性として現れるが、それは、所有者の「独りよがり」の主観的活動をとおしていわばその共同事業の疎外態として成立する点で自然法則とは異なる、という独自な法則認識がそれである。このように歴史法則の特殊性を把握した宇野にとって、意思関係が経済過程で「媒介形態」としての役割を演じることなど自明であった。ただそれはかかるものとしてはいまだ「無色の関係」にすぎず、経済的関係に障害が生じたとき、規範法に転化し社会的強制力を有する法的関係としてポジティブに出現すると考えたのである。つまり宇野にとって意思関係とは空気のようなものであったとみてよかろう。市民社会に住む人々はそれを無意識のうちに呼吸しているわけである。また法的関係がもっばら「救済」の側面から語られたことは、法が経済過程にとって補足的な作用を有するものとして消極的に位置づけられたことを意味する。もちろん法的関係は経済的関係を包摂するが、そのことは決して法の優位性を示すものではないのである。実際、宇野のいうように、法律が商品交換を成立させるわけではない。法律関係は、経済の内容にまで立ち入るものではなく、経済過程を「何ら說明するもの」ではない。そしてこの点では「装いの重大性」をとく鵜飼らの見解は一種の法律優位主義に陥ったものと解さざるをえない。だが、「物を生産し、分配するというょうな関係自身は、法律関係とはいえない」。法律の外被性は、資本主義の発展·変化の過程が「法律関係でかわるということは、いい得ない」という事実に明瞭に示されている。 このように、経済と法の関連把握の問題についても、われわれは宇野の見解を基本的に支持しうる。意思関係と法的関係との関連、とくに前者の後者への転変の契機や過程をどうとらえるかといった問題は残るにしても、宇野の発言はかなり的確に事態の核心をとらえていたといわざるをえない。 （2）残された問題点 近代法論争において、われわれは宇野の見解を基本的に支持しうるわけだが、それ自体はまだ国家論ヘの法律学的アプローチの可能性を示唆するにとどまった。この論争をとおし、宇野は一貫して法律学に対し「門外漢」の立場をつらぬき、具体的内容にふれる発言はしなかったのである。したがって、先の三つの争点も、方法的にはともかく、理論的にはなんら史実的検討や論証を伴うものではなかったのであって、ついに学問的な決着はつけられずに終わったのである。各争点について、今後更なる検討が学問的に要求されると考えられる諸問題を列記しておこう。”翻译为中文","completion":"从这里可以看出，虽然鵜飼和藤田在前者主张法的非阶级性，后者作为“本质规定”主张其阶级性这一点上看似完全对立，但实际上只不过是表面上的对立。在前述的二元论中，前者只是重视“精神”，后者重视“物质”。双方都认为交换关系既是经济关系又是法律关系，实际上并无区别。然而，这种认识不仅轻视了资本主义的经济自立性，还使法的“外壳”性质变得不明确。如此，资本主义中经济过程所占据的基础性地位和法律过程的外在和补充性地位变得模糊不清。实际上，在鵜飼、藤田的观点中，法律关系似乎成为规范经济关系内容的“装扮”。但这种重视意识论和“双重契机”统一论最终会导致否定唯物史观中的上层建筑和基础的区分。 相对于这一点，宇野的观点尽管有些抽象，但其在认识经济和法为内容和形式相关性方面是值得评价的。通过他独特的《资本论》研究，宇野已经明确了即使在经济过程中，商品所有者的意志或欲望这类主观要素也发挥着重要作用。这是其对经济法则的独特理解所要求的。个体所有者追求私利的主观行动不经意形成了社会上的客观法则，但一旦形成，就好像“自然法则”一样规范和支配个体所有者的行动。因此，在此，经济法则作为外在必然性出现于各个所有者，但它作为个人“自私自利”行动的异化态存在，与自然法则不同，这是一种独特的法则认识。宇野在把握历史法则的特殊性方面，将意志关系在经济过程中作为“媒介形式”扮演的角色视为显而易见。只不过作为这种角色，它仍然不过是“无色关系”，在经济关系遇到障碍时，会转化为带有社会强制力的法律关系，并以积极形式出现。可以说，对于宇野而言，意志关系就像空气一样。居住在市民社会中的人们无意识地呼吸着它。法律关系从“救济”角度被讨论，意味着法在经济过程中作为补充作用被消极定位。当然法律关系吸纳了经济关系，但这并不表明法的优越性。实际上，如宇野所言，法律并不是使商品交换成立的因素。法律关系并不深入经济内容，也不是“解释”经济过程的东西。在这一点上，强调“装扮重要性”的鵜飼等人的观点不免陷入一种法律优越主义。但是，“生产和分配等关系本身不能说是法律关系”。法的外壳性在资本主义的发展·变化过程中“无法以法律关系改变”这一事实上被明确展现。 因此，在认识经济与法的关系问题上，我们基本上可以支持宇野的观点。尽管对意志关系与法律关系的关联、特别是前者向后者转变的契机或过程等问题仍有留疑，但宇野的发言相当准确地把握了事态的核心。 （2）遗留的问题点 在近代法辩论中，我们基本上可以支持宇野的观点，但这本身仅暗示了向国家论的法学方法论的可能性。通过这场辩论，宇野始终坚持“门外汉”的立场，未就具体内容发表过言论。因此，之前的三个争点，无论在方法上还是理论上，都未伴随历史性的考察或论证，最终没有得到学术性的解决。对于每个争点，未来仍需要学术上的深入讨论。"},{"prompt":"请将“近代法の原理についていえばまずレヒト（＝社会的規範としての法）としての近代法の原理的な体系化が可能な根拠が、歴史実証的につめられなければならない。すなわち資本主義の純粋化傾向に対応した私法、刑法、公法の近代化がイングランド法の歴史的変遷の検討をとおして論証されなけれぼならないのである。だが、それは簡単ではない。イングランド法の特殊性-判例法主義と不文法主義-のため、変遷史のトレースは復雜を極めることが予想されるからである。つぎに、（6）国家を前提しないレヒトとしての法の体系化が可能であるとして、その場合の社会規範の性格と意義が国家規範との比較でョリ明確に規定されなければならない。資本主義の経済構造に外的に対応する近代法は、いうまでもなくレヒトとして原理的に体系化され、かつ＜法の支配＞という形で国家を規制する独自な範疇として構成されることになるが、現実には法は国家権力に基礎づけられた法規としていわば制定法の形態をとって現れるのであって、この法の二重性の有する意味が、より詳細に追求されなければならない。更に、そのうえにたって）近代法の構造が具体的に解明されなければならない。私法から公法への上向が、その必然的な脈絡において示されることによって、私法、刑法、公法の相互連関もまた明らかにされうるのである。

また、宇野のいう法の階級性の論証という点について細部に問題があろう。宇野は近代法原理の修正（＝労働法などの社会政策立法の出現）を、帝国主義段階ヘの移行に伴う階級関係の変化に対応したものと說明しているが、近代法はあくまでも『資本論』に対応するような法律学原理の問題なのであって、法の変更にぉいてその階級性を論証する場合には自由主義段階の法律の帝国主義段階のそれヘの変化が問題にされなければならないのではないか。産業資本段階＝近代法という図式は安易にすぎるのであって、近代法と産業資本段階の法形態とが区別されたうえで、法律の段階的推移がおさえられなければならない。 経済と法との関連では、意思関係と法的関係との関連が理論的に解明されなければならない。すなわち Sein としてある「無色な」意思関係が、何を契機に、またどのようなプロセスをとおしてSo1len に外化するかが分析されなければならない。法的関係が経済的意思関係と異なり当為規範·強制規範として強制力を有する根拠が、この疎外の構造においてとかれる必要がある。だが問題はこれにとどまらない。上述したように法的関係そのものも社会規範、国家規範という形でいわば二重に構築されているからである。したがって意思関係、社会規範、制定法の三者の独自性と相互関連が、経済→法→国家の道すじに即して、理論的に究明されなくてはならないのである。 以上、残された問題点を整理してきたが、論争の最大の難点は次の点にあった。すなわち＜何のための近代法論争なのか＞を当事者たちは一向に明らかにしなかったのである“もちろん、宇野は法律が経済と政治の媒介項をなすこと、したがってその科学的解明は国家論研究への橋頭堡となることを意識していたといってよいが、その当人さえ、なお、近代法の原理的展開が如何なる意味で近代国家の解明に役立ちうるかについては、「検討を要する」とするだけで、その有効性を具体的には示すことができなかった。しかし、これは無理もないことであった。近代法の体系化が国家論研究にどのような役割をはたすのかを明確にするためには、まさに近代法を実際に展開してみる必要があったからである。”翻译为中文","completion":"关于近代法原理，首先必须从历史实证的角度论证作为社会规范的近代法（Recht）系统化的可能性。即对应资本主义的纯化趋势的私法、刑法和公法的现代化必须通过考察英国法的历史变迁来论证。但这并非容易之事，由于英国法的特殊性——案例法原则和不成文法原则——预计变迁历史的追踪将极其复杂。其次，假设不以国家为前提的Recht作为法的系统化是可能的，在这种情况下，社会规范的性质和意义必须与国家规范相比较得更为明确。对应资本主义经济结构的近代法显然原则上被系统化为Recht，并以“法的统治”形式构成对国家的规制的独特范畴，但实际上，法作为基于国家权力的法规而以制定法的形式出现，这种法的双重性的含义需要更详细的探讨。此外，基于这一点，近代法的结构必须被具体阐明。通过展示私法至公法的向上延伸在其必然脉络中，私法、刑法和公法的相互关系也可能被澄清。 关于法律的性质，作为Recht的法虽然本身采取非阶级性形式，但也是可以“包含”阶级性的形态，这一点必须在法律关系所具有的形式化自主性特征中被明确。也就是说，尽管是形式上的，但法学和经济学中提到的价值和使用价值相当的某种“矛盾”必须包含其中。否则，近代法最终无法作为一个体系在原则上展开。我们认为这可以在近代法规范拥有的两面性中发现，即权利关系的规则性质（= 客观、普遍方面）和强制性质（=统治、约束方面）。这是经济学中商品的双重关系被翻译为法学范畴的情况，但法的阶级性将在法形态的发展基础上的这种对立中消失。 另外，就宇野关于法的阶级性的论证而言，存在一些细节上的问题。宇野解释近代法原理的修正（如劳动法等社会政策立法的出现）是作为对帝国主义阶段随着阶级关系变化的相应，但近代法无疑应是一个匹配《资本论》的法学原理问题，当论证法的变更中的阶级性时，自由主义阶段的法律向帝国主义阶段变化的问题或许应被提出。工业资本阶段=近代法的模式过于简化，近代法和工业资本阶段的法形态应在区分基础上，法律的阶段性转变需要被捕捉。 在经济与法的关联中，意志关系与法律关系的关系必须被理论上阐明。即作为Sein的“无色的”意志关系，是在何种契机下，通过何种过程，转化为Sollen的，必须被分析。法律关系作为区别于经济意志关系的应然规范、强制规范拥有强制力的基础，需要在这种异化结构中被阐释。但问题不止于此。正如前述，法律关系本身也是以社会规范、国家规范的形式双重构建的。因此，意志关系、社会规范、制定法的独特性和相互关联，必须根据经济→法→国家的路径，理论上被究明。 以上，我们整理了遗留的问题点，但辩论的最大难点在于：参与者们完全没有明确“为何进行近代法辩论”。当然，宇野意识到法律作为经济和政治的媒介项，因此其科学解明将成为通向国家论研究的桥头堡，但连他本人也仅将近代法的原理性展开对现代国家解明的意义视为“需要探讨”而已，未能具体展示其有效性。不过，这也是情有可原的。要明确系统化近代法对国家论研究的作用，正需要实际展开近代法。"},{"prompt":"请将“経済学原理論は資本主義の経済構造をおよそ次のように解明していた。商品、貨幣の発展形態である資本は、労働力の商品化を基礎に社会存立の根拠をなす労働生産過程を包摂し、資本·賃労働の搾取関係を形成するが、資本の流通運動はこの生産過程を媒介しすすんでそれを資本の再生産過程として実現させることになる。だが、資本は具体的にはョリ多くの利潤を求めて競争する個別資本としてあり、その運動は資本主義に特殊な形態機構を創りださずにはおかない。そこでは剰余価值が利潤、地代、利子に分割されるが、この分配関係の展開は、価値法則が貫徹する過程であると同時に資本関係の物化が進行し物神性が完成する過程でもある。信用と商業資本の運動を媒介に利子生み資本の理念が形成され、資本はそれを所有すること自身が果実（＝利子）をもたらすものとして商品化されることになる（＝擬制資本の成立）。そこでは階級関係は商品関係のうちに埋没してしまう。したがって、資本主義は非階級的な商品交換社会として現象する、というのである。 人間関係の物化は同時に物の人格化でもあるが、物神性の成立は経済人（＝「経済的諸範疇」の人格化としてのホモ·エコノミクス）に商品経済は人間にとって自然かつ合理的な関係であるという倒いつとき錯意識を生むことになる。貨幣は「万能な神」となり、資本は一時も無駄に遊休させてはならない「富の源泉」となる。資本家、土地所有者はもちろん、労働者も貨幣および資本の物神性にその意識を支配されざるをえない。この物神性の支配は、資本主義を人間に本来的社会として永遠視させ、商品経済的イデォロギー（I「自由、平等、所有およびベンサム」）を社会的通念とするに至る。こうして経済人は、物神性を無自覚的に受けいれ、商品経済とそのイデォロギーを人間に合理的な関係ないし観念とみなすことになる。資本主義は、日々の実践を介して、経済人にとれを叩き込み、彼らを精神的、人格的に陶冶する。服従しない者や反撥する者には倒産と貧困への自由が用意されることになる。経済人は資本主義が鼓吹するこの精神的価值を強制としてではなく、内面的欲求の満足として感得することになるのである。 経済人にとっては、資本主義社会は非階級的な商品交換社会すなわち市民社会として現象することになる。経済人はそこでは一個の独立した商品所有者ないし生産者として現れる。マルクスもいうように「実際的な欲望、利己主義」が「市民社会の原理」であり、その「神は貨幣である」。したがって経済人は、節約·貯蓄という禁欲的態度をとりながらも、ョリ多くの所得と利益を求めて勤労し、資産の活用に心がけることになる。経済人は自由に私利的活動を展開するが、自由な経済活動といっても、その行動はある程度予見可能な画一的かつ定型的なものになっている。それゆえ経済人は相手のリアクションを予想して合目的的に経済活動を遂行できるのである。 経済人は先の社会的通念にのっとり、市民社会で私利的活動に専念することになるが、そうなるとそこに相互に遵守すべき社会規範が形成されることになる。当事者間の経済的意思および支配の領域が衝突·対立する場合、その意思の実現は、むきだしの暴力によらないかぎり、相手方の承認を媒介とせざるをえなくなる。経済的な権利関係は、両当事者がともに認めなければならない「第三の立場」にたつ規範の成立をまってはじめて客観的に確定されることになる。これは換言すれば、円滑な経済運営のためには、個々の市民は合意にもとづき一定の社会規範を形成せざるをえないことを示している。すなわち規範は個々の市民の経済的意思関係の共同疎外態であり、そのようなものとして市民間の関係を律する客観的なルールとなるのである。規範の客観性は、市民の主体的対抗の在り方が経済的な権利関係をとっていることと不可分離な関係にあるとみてよい。各市民は自ら規範の形成に関与しているかぎり、この行為規範（＝生ける法）に自発的に服従せざるをえない。それにたいし規範は個々の市民からは独立したルールとして市民の経済活動を外的に規制することになるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"经济学原理论说明了资本主义的经济结构大约是这样解明的：作为商品、货币的发展形态的资本，以劳动力的商品化作为基础，包含在社会存在的根本——劳动生产过程中，并形成资本-雇佣劳动的剥削关系，而资本的流通运动则通过这种生产过程来进行，使之成为资本的再生产过程。然而，具体来说，资本作为争取更多利润而竞争的个别资本而存在，其运动不得不创造出特有的形式机制。在这里，剩余价值被分割为利润、地租和利息，这种分配关系的展开既是价值法则贯彻的过程，又是资本关系物化、物神性完成的过程。信用和商业资本的运动作为媒介，形成了产生利息的资本的理念，资本变为拥有本身就带来果实（= 利息）的商品（= 擬制资本的形成）。在这里，阶级关系沉没在商品关系之中。因此，资本主义表现为非阶级性的商品交换社会。 物的人格化同时也是人际关系的物化，但物神性的成立使商品经济变成对人类来说自然而合理的关系，这产生了颠倒的错觉。货币变成“万能之神”，资本成为不得分秒闲置的“财富之源”。资本家、地主当然如此，工人也不得不受到货币和资本的物神性支配。这种物神性的支配使资本主义被视为人类的本质社会而永恒化，商品经济意识形态（= “自由、平等、所有权以及边沁”）成为社会的共识。因此，经济人无意识地接受物神性，将商品经济及其意识形态视为人类的合理关系或理念。资本主义通过日常实践教育经济人，精神上、人格上培养他们。对不顺从或反抗者，准备了破产和贫困的自由。经济人将感受到资本主义所宣扬的这些精神价值，不作为强制，而作为内在欲求的满足。 对经济人而言，资本主义社会表现为非阶级性的商品交换社会即市民社会。在这里，经济人作为独立的商品所有者或生产者出现。如马克思所说，“实际的欲望、利己主义”是“市民社会的原理”，其“神是货币”。因此，经济人在持节俭、储蓄的禁欲态度的同时，追求更多的收入和利润，致力于资产的利用。经济人自由地展开私利活动，但所谓的自由经济活动，其行动在一定程度上是可预测的、刻板的。因此，经济人能根据对方的反应预期，有目的地进行经济活动。 遵循社会共识，经济人将专注于市民社会中的私利活动，这样就形成了相互遵守的社会规范。当各方的经济意志和统治领域发生冲突、对立时，意志的实现，除非通过裸露的暴力，否则不得不通过对方的认可来中介。经济权利关系的确定性，要等到双方都必须认同的“第三方立场”的规范形成后才能客观确定。换句话说，为了保障经济运作的顺畅，每个市民必须基于共识形成一定的社会规范。规范作为个体市民经济意志关系的共同异化态，作为这样的存在，成为规制市民间关系的客观规则。规范的客观性，在市民的主观对立状态采取经济权利关系这一点上，可以看作是不可分割的。只要个体市民参与到规范的形成中，他们就不得不自发地服从这种行为规范（=生动的法律）。相对此，规范作为独立于个体市民的规则，将从外部规制市民的经济活动。"},{"prompt":"请将“ルールからの逸脱が、この社会規範を強制規範に転化させる。違約により権利を侵害された当事者は相手方に約束の履行か損害賠償のいずれかを要求することになるが、規範はこの要求に応えなければならない。規範は、ルールからの逸脱をチェックする、制裁を伴強制規範となる。社会規範は、市民相互の権利関係を客観的に規律し確定すると同時に逸脱行動がひきおこす有害な結果を除去し市民を権利の侵害から救済するといういわば二重の性格をおびることになる。こうして社会規範は法規範になる。法規範とは「権利主体間の関係を規律し、その違反には制度化されたリアクションが続く、規範秩序」（G·ルミア『法の理論とイデオロギー』有信堂、一九七五年、二五-二六頁）である。 経済的関係は法規範に媒介されて法的関係となるが、マルクスは両者を次のように関連づけていた。交換過程では「一方はただ他方の同意のもとにのみ、すなわちどちらもただ両者に共通な一つの意思行為を媒介としてのみ、自分の商品を手放すことによって、他人の商品を自分のものにするのである。それゆえ、彼らは互いに相手を私的所有者として認めあわなければならない。契約をその形態とするこの法的関係は、法律的に発展していてもいなくても、経済的関係がそこに反映している一つの意思関係である。この法的関係、または意思関係の内容は、経済的関係そのものによってえられている」（資本論』一一三頁）。経済にたいし法は、いわば内容を包む形式をなすにすぎず、経済的関係が外部的要因（＝強力や詐欺など）により支障をきたさないかぎり、法的関係は消極的なものにとどまる。経済的関係そのもののなかにも権利関係·意思関係は存在するが、それはまだ「無色の関係」にすぎない。法は、この先在する経済的関係にその内容を規定されながらもそれを形式的にフォローすることによって、意思関係を法的関係として形式的に自立させることになるのである。 法は、それ自体は抽象的命題にすぎないのに、それに規制されて行動する当事者にとっては具体的権利となって現れる。当事者は「客観的な法」に依って権利を具体的に主張するが、逆にその権利主張が「客観的な法」の支配を支えることにもなる。したがって法は、主権的には権利であるが、客観的には規範である。法の主観性と客観性は「相互規定的であり」（渡辺洋三『法社会学と法解釈学』岩波書店、一九五九年、五七頁）、そのいずれを欠いても法は法として存在しえないのである。ゆえに、経済的関係も「主観的な法」と「客観的な法」において表現されることになる。経済的権利は法的権利とされ、しかもそれは法規範の成立を媒介にし、それに依拠して主張されることになるのである。これは当然、経済的関係は法によって支持されなければならないという要請が現実の市民社会のなかに存在していることを意味する。法はそのかぎりで当為性のうちに存在性＝事実性を包括するのである。 (2)近代法の性格 近代法は、客観的なルールとして、力の行使を規制する一個の権威を獲得する。国家権力といえども、法が定めた力の行使の適法条件に従わなければならないのであって、近代社会では＜法の支配＞が貫徹することになる。他面、法は強制規範であり、違法に物理的な制裁を加えうる点で、他の一切の社会規範（＝道德·宗教など）と区別される。法に制裁を可能にする強制力は、具体的な完成された形態では国家権力であるが、直接的かつ第一次的には「組織された社会的力」と規定できよう。法ゲせルシヤフトは市民社会の内部から、資本の私的社会編成に対応して形成されるのであって、強制力抽象的にはそとにその根拠を有するとみてよい。こうして「正義の女神」は、イエーリンクもいうように、片手に「衡器」、片手に「剣」をもって現れることになるが、近代法にあってはこのニつの契機のうち、前者が積極的な契機をなし、後者は前者が成立するための消極的条件をなしている。両者の統一としては、法は、カによって支えれらながらも、カの行使を規制するそれ自身独自な力である。”翻译为中文","completion":"违反规则将这些社会规范转化为强制规范。违约行为侵犯权利的当事者将要求对方履行约定或赔偿损害，规范必须响应这些要求。规范成为检查规则偏离的、带有制裁的强制规范。社会规范具有双重性质，即客观规范市民间的权利关系并确定之，同时消除偏离行为引发的有害后果，救济市民免受权利侵害，这样社会规范成为法律规范。法律规范是“规范秩序，它规范权利主体间的关系，并对其违反跟随有制度化的反应”（G·鲁米亚《法的理论与意识形态》有信堂，1975年，25-26页）。 经济关系通过法律规范的介入而成为法律关系，马克思将两者关联起来。在交换过程中，“一方只是在另一方同意下，即双方仅作为共同的意志行为的介质下，才将自己的商品放弃，以此换取他人的商品。因此，他们必须相互承认对方为私有者。以契约作为其形式的这一法律关系，不管法律是否发展，都是一个意志关系，反映了经济关系”（《资本论》113页）。对于经济来说，法律不过是包裹内容的形式，只要经济关系不因外部因素（= 暴力或欺诈等）受阻，法律关系将保持消极状态。经济关系内部同样存在权利关系·意志关系，但它们仅仅是“无色关系”。法律在规定这些先存经济关系的内容的同时，通过形式上跟进，将意志关系作为法律关系形式上自立。 法律本身是一个抽象命题，但对于被其规制的当事者来说，表现为具体的权利。当事者依据“客观的法”具体主张权利，反过来他们的权利主张也支持了“客观的法”的统治。因此，法律主观上是权利，客观上是规范。“法律的主观性和客观性是‘相互规定的’”（渡边洋三《法社会学与法解释学》岩波书店，1959年，57页），缺一不可法律才能作为法律存在。因此，经济关系也将在“主观的法”与“客观的法”中得到表达。经济权利被视为法律权利，并且通过法律规范的成立来依赖并主张。这当然意味着经济关系必须由法律所支持，这是现实市民社会中存在的要求。法律在这种程度上包含了应然性中的存在性=事实性。 # 近代法的性质 近代法作为客观规则，获得了规制力量行使的权威。即使是国家权力，也必须遵循法律规定的力量行使的合法条件，在近代社会，“法的统治”得以贯彻。另一方面，法律作为强制规范，能够对违法行为施加物理惩罚，在这一点上区别于所有其他社会规范（= 道德、宗教等）。法律赋予制裁的强制力具体完成形态是国家权力，但直接和首先可以被规定为“组织化的社会力量”。法ゲセルシャフト是从市民社会内部形成的，以对应私有资本的社会组织，因此，强制力在抽象上可以看作有其基础。这样，“正义女神”将出现，如耶林克所言，一手持“天平”，一手持“剑”。但在近代法中，这两个契机中，前者形成积极条件，后者为前者的成立提供消极条件。作为二者统一，法律既得到支持，也以独自的力量规制权力行使。"},{"prompt":"请将“営利的精神が市民社会の精神をなすが、近代法はそのような市民社会から内的に生みだされるものとして、個人主義の原則、法律普遍·権利平等の原則および契約自由の原則を確立する。そしてそれは人権の不可侵性や信義則により基礎づけられることになるのである。近代法は、市民法（＝私法）に代表されるものとしては、次の二つの性格を有する。ひとつは、それが権利ないし義務本位のものとして構成されるということであり、もうひとつは「物質的利害主義」が支配するということである。両者は相互補完的な関連にある。近代法は、権利本位の構成をとるがゆえに法的関係を純財産的な価值に還元でき、また「物質的利害主義」をとるがゆえに権利関係を普遍化しうるのである。近代法はこの二つの性格をあわせもつものとして、M·ウェーパーのいう「計算可能な」「合理的なる法」（『一般社会経済史要論·下卷』岩波書店、一九五五年、一二一頁）となる。また近代法は、資本主義の物神性の作用により、個人主義的自然法にその思想的な基礎をおくことになる。自然法は近代法上の諸権利を恒久不変な自然権として構成する。マルクスが「ヘーゲル国法論批判」で指摘したように、市民ないし非政治的な人間は必ず「自然的人間」として現れ、「人の権利」は「自然権」として現れるのである。したがって資本主義では法の物神性が生ずることになる。 パシュカーニスがいうように、「法的形態の起源は交換関係のなかに求めなければならない」（前掲書、四一頁）。私法とりわけ所有権法が「法律的上部構造の基層」（同、九二頁）をなす。法的関係は、端緒的には、交換関係を顛倒して表現したものにほかならない。「もし経済的に物が人間を支配するとすれば、······法律的に人間は物を支配する」（同、一一八頁）。したがって法主体（＝法的人格）、(3)（向）法律行為（＝契約）、2）所有権（＝物的·人的財産権）が、近代法の始元をなす。は「法律理論の原子」であり、商品所有者を範型として法律人を構成する近代法は、それを物神性により「人間一般」、「人格一般」として表現する。法的主体には自由意思が絶対不可欠な要件とされ、その意思に基づき主体に一定の権利と義務が帰属するものとされる。ことでは身分、階級、職業などの一切の具体的関係が捨象され、「法の前の平等」という原則がうちたてられることになる。）は、自由意思の働きを伴う行為であり、それは法主体に権利を設定、移転、変更させることになる。法律行為には双務的なものと片務的なものがあるが、前者では契約がその一般的形態となる。先の「自由な法人格」は法律行為にいわゆる契約自由の原則（＝方式自由の原則、意思定則の原則、個人的過失責任の原則から成る）を導くととになる。私的自治が法律行為の普遍的な原理になるのである。は、「恒常的な市場」と「財貨の流通」によってつくりだされるのであって、労働力の商品化と土地の流動化を契機にあらゆるものが譲渡移転の客体となるところに近代的所有権の本質的起源がある。物は、それが交換価値の形態をおびるとき、「権利の純粋な客体となり、それを処分する主体は、純粋な法律的主体となる」（同、一二九頁）。法はこれを二段階の論理-）主体は自己の所持する物に対して排他的な所有権を有している。それを前提にして、契約に基づく所有権の移転が実現される、という-で表現する。したがって所有権は、法的には、自由意思が外界に向かって働きかけることによって生まれる「個人の意思の不覇独立な支配の領域」として静態的に規定されることになる。その対象領域は自然·物と人間であり、前者は「物上の権利」を、後者は特定の人に力や活動を要求する権利を形成する。そしてそれを前提に、所有権は、人と人との意思·契約関係で流動化すると観念されるのである。その際、物的財産と役務·給付は、法主体の利益の投射点として権利の客体となるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"营利精神构成了市民社会的精神，近代法作为从这样的市民社会内部生成的东西，确立了个人主义原则、法律普遍性·权利平等原则以及契约自由原则。它是基于人权不可侵犯和诚信原则的。近代法，代表于民事法（=私法），具有以下两个特征：一是构成为权利或义务为本的特征，二是“物质利益主义”占据主导。这两者相互补充。由于近代法采取了权利为本的构成，能够将法律关系还原为纯粹的财产价值，并且由于采取“物质利益主义”，能够使权利关系普遍化。近代法结合这两个特征成为马克斯·韦伯所说的“可计算的”、“合理的法律”（《一般社会经济史要论·下卷》岩波书店，1955年，121页）。此外，近代法因资本主义的物质性作用，在个人主义自然法上找到了它的思想基础。自然法将近代法上的各种权利构造为恒久不变的自然权。正如马克思在《黑格尔国法论批判》中指出的那样，市民即非政治的人必定作为“自然的人”出现，“人的权利”表现为“自然权”。因此，在资本主义中，法的物质性会产生。 如帕什卡尼斯所说，“法律形式的起源必须在交换关系中寻找”（前述书籍，41页）。私法尤其是所有权法构成了“法律上层建筑的基层”（同，92页）。法律关系起初不过是交换关系的颠倒表达。“如果经济上物支配了人……法律上人将支配物”（同，118页）。因此，法律主体（=法律人格）、法律行为（=契约）、所有权（=物质·人身财产权）构成近代法的起源。法律主体作为“法律理论的原子”，近代法以商品所有者为原型构造法律人，并通过物质性将其表现为“人类一般”、“人格一般”。法律主体赋予自由意志作为绝对必要的条件，基于这一意志为主体赋予特定的权利和义务。这里，身份、阶级、职业等所有具体关系被抛弃，“法前平等”的原则得以确立。法律行为是伴随自由意志活动的行为，它赋予法律主体设定、移转、变更权利的能力。法律行为有双边和单边之分，前者以契约为其一般形态。前述的“自由法人格”引导出所谓契约自由原则（=形式自由原则、意志自主原则、个人过失责任原则）。私法自治成为法律行为的普遍原理。所有权是由“恒定的市场”和“财货的流通”创造出来的，以劳动力的商品化和土地的流通为契机，使所有事物都成为转让移转的对象，这是近代所有权的本质起源。当物采取交换价值形态时，“成为权利的纯粹客体，处理它的主体成为纯粹的法律主体”（同，129页）。法律用两步逻辑表达这一点——首先，主体对自己所拥有的物有排他性的所有权。在此基础上，基于契约的所有权转让得以实现——因此，所有权法律上被定义为由个人意志向外发挥作用而产生的“个人意志的不受侵犯的支配领域”的静态状态。其对象领域是自然·物与人，前者形成“物上的权利”，后者形成要求特定人施加力量或活动的权利。并且以此为前提，所有权被认为是在人与人之间的意志·契约关系中流动化。物质财产和劳务·给付成为法律主体利益的投射点，成为权利的客体。"},{"prompt":"请将“以上、近代法の二契機、基本的性格および始元をみてきたが、近代法が上述したような合理的かつ普遍的な形式をとるということは、法の階級性を否定するものではない。法の遵守は経済的搾取が実現されることを意味している。近代法はその非階級的な権利関係のうちに階級関係を包含しているのであって、そこに法の階級性が見い出されなければならない。資本主義以前の社会では階級支配は身分的、暴力的に行われたが、資本主義では階級支配は自由、平等な形式をとおしていわば合法的に実現されるのである。 (③)法の矛盾と発展 法的イデォロギーは形式論理的一貫性を重視するので、法形式それ自身を考察するかぎり、法には矛盾·対立は存在しないように見える。しかし、それは関係として一個の独自な社会関係を形成している。法的関係は経済的関係をフォローすることにより、自己のうちに階級関係を内包せざるをえない。法的関係は階級関係を正当化してもそれを解消するものではない。間接的に階級支配の維持に関つているのである。そしてこのことは、先述したように、法がたんなる権利関係にとどまらぬもう一つの契機をすなわち強制関係を有する点に表現されている。 近代法は、すでにみたように、労働力の商品化を基礎にした一社会の商品経済化にその成立根拠を有していた。「資本と労働との交換」こそ、近代私法の生成をその根本で規定していたのである。したがつて法の二契機も労働力の売買に即して分析されることにより、その本質的意義を明らかにされよう。労働市場での労働力の売買（＝「第一の過程」）は、生産過程で資本·賃労働関係を形成する（-「第二の過程」）が、法はこの関係全体を雇用契約にもとづく一種の債権関係とみなす。契約に際しては両者は対等な立場にたって、労務の提供と反対給付を定めることになる。資本家と労働者は、使用人と被使用人として「反対方向の、かつ、相等しい内容をもつ」権利関係に入るのである。 だが、「第一の過程」と異なり「第二の過程」はたんなる権利関係ではない。労働力は他の商品とは異なるいわば何で生産できる独自な商品として資本家に生産的に消費されることになる。資本家は、「労働に対立する労働条件の人格化」として「生産の指導者および支配者」となり、生産過程「規則的な権威の形態と完全なヒエラルヒーとして編成」する。すなわち資本家は「権力者」として賃労働を支配し剰余労働を搾取するのであって、支配·従属関係が生産過程の本質をなす。しかし、法はこの二つの過程を区別しない。雇用契約（そこでは労働力の価値に関わる賃金も、使用価值に関わる労働日、労働の強度も雇用条件に一括される）からも明らかのように、いずれも法的には権利関係の構成要因とされる。契約が履行されるかぎり、このことになんら不都合はないが、契約が必ず履行されるとはかぎらない。生産過程における労働関係は、本来、権利関係とは異質な支配·服従関係をその内容としているからである。もちろん、そうだからといって、階級関係を権利関係で包摂している以上、法は契約不履行にたいし無力であることを許されない。それを自己への挑戦とみなし、権利の侵害には訴権を与え、権利関係の維持に努めるのである。法は違反には制裁装置をもって契約の履行ないし損害賠償を強制することになる（理論的にはともかく実際には、イギリス主従法にも見られるように、法は資本家に一方的に有利なものであった。労働者側の違反申立てが賃金不払問題に限定され、その救済も動産差押え·競売による履行保証をでなかったのにたいし、雇用主側の申立ては、不就労、職務放棄、職務怠慢、不正行為のすベてにおよび、司法権力もそれに労働者の逮補と懲治監収容をもって対応したのである）。 したがって法は権利関係とにどまらぬ、もう一つの貌すなわち強制関係を有することになる。前者は労働力の商品的性格（＝資本の形態性）に、後者はその非商品的性格（＝資本の階級性）深く結びついている。パシュカーニスもいうように、搾取関係が商品関係に媒介されている以上、「人間にたいする人間の権力」は、「客観的で公平な規範」として、いわば「抽象的、非個人的な」法的強制としてしか現れることができないのである。こうして労働力商品化の矛盾は法の二契機として形式的に表現されるが、法は労働力の売買を他の商品交換一般から区別しない（I雇用の債権関係への埋没）。それゆえ、この形式的矛盾は私法的関係に一般的なるものとして表現されることになる。”翻译为中文","completion":"我们已经看到了近代法的两个契机、基本特性和起源，但近代法采取如上述的合理且普遍的形式，并不意味着否定了法的阶级性。法的遵守意味着经济剥削得以实现。近代法在其非阶级性的权利关系中包含了阶级关系，必须在这里发现法的阶级性。在资本主义之前的社会中，阶级统治是以身份和暴力进行的，而在资本主义中，阶级统治是以自由、平等的形式合法地实现的。 # 法的矛盾与发展 法律意识形态强调形式逻辑的一致性，因此，只要考察法的形式本身，法看似不存在矛盾和对立。然而，它作为关系形成了独特的社会关系。法律关系因跟随经济关系而不得不内含阶级关系。法律关系虽然可以对阶级关系进行正当化，却不能消解它。它间接地与维持阶级统治相关。这一点，就如前述，表现在法不仅仅是权利关系，而且具有牵涉到强制关系这一额外契机上。 如我们所见，近代法的成立基于以劳动力的商品化为基础的社会的商品经济化。“资本与劳动的交换”确切地规定了近代私法的生成根源。因此，法的两个契机通过对劳动力买卖的分析被明确地展示出其本质意义。劳动力在劳动市场的购买（=“第一过程”）形成资本与雇佣劳动关系（=“第二过程”），但法将这整个关系视为基于雇用合同的某种债权关系。签订合同时，双方处于平等的立场，确定劳务提供和相应报酬。资本家和工人以雇主和受雇者的身份进入“方向相反、内容相等”的权利关系。 但与“第一过程”不同，“第二过程”并非仅仅是权利关系。劳动力作为一种可以生产的独特商品被资本家生产性消耗。资本家作为“对立于劳动的劳动条件的人格化”，成为“生产的指导者和统治者”，以“规范的权威形式和完整的等级制度”组织生产过程。即资本家作为“权力者”，统治雇佣劳动并剥削剩余劳动，支配和从属关系构成生产过程的本质。然而，法并不区分这两个过程。如雇佣合同所示（其中关于劳动力价值的工资、使用价值的劳动日、劳动强度都被整合为雇佣条件），法律上都被视为权利关系的组成部分。只要合同得到履行，这并不构成问题，但并非所有合同都必然履行。生产过程中的劳动关系本质上与权利关系不同，其内容是支配和从属关系。当然，就算存在阶级关系被权利关系包含的情况下，法也不能容忍合同违反行为。它将之视为对自身的挑战，赋予权利侵犯的诉权，致力于维护权利关系。法通过制裁机制强制履行合同或赔偿损害（不论理论上还是实际上，如英国的主从法所示，法律曾经一方面对资本家有利，工人方面的违反申诉限于工资未付问题，其救济也未涉及执行保证的动产扣押·拍卖，而对雇主方面的申诉涵盖未工作、职务放弃、职务怠慢、不当行为，司法权力对此以工人的逮捕和惩治监禁作为回应）。 因此，法不仅仅具有权利关系，还具有另一面貌即强制关系。前者深度绑定于劳动力的商品性（=资本的形式性），后者则深度绑定于其非商品性（=资本的阶级性）。如帕什卡尼斯所说，由于剥削关系通过商品关系中介，“人对人的权力”只能以“客观且公正的规范”，即作为“抽象的、非个人的”法律强制而呈现。因此，劳动力商品化的矛盾以法的两个契机形式表现，但法并不区分劳动力买卖与一般商品交换（陷入雇佣的债权关系）。这种形式上的矛盾因此作为私法关系中的一般现象而表现。"},{"prompt":"请将“そして私法が有するこの矛盾から刑法さらには公法が展開されることになる。私法は市民間の権利関係を規律するが、権利の侵犯には積極的に対応できない。訴権や不法行為法の発展は権利の侵害への抑止装置となっているが、それらは事後的に権利関係を修復するものにすぎず、不法への対処としては限界を有さざるをえない。近代法は、その強制規範的側面を前面にうちだしてとの要請に応えることになる。すなわち諸種の犯罪を類別し、それに一定の刑罰を科すことになる。ここでは、私法にあって消極的条件をなしていた、強制力を支える「社会的力」が公権力へと発展し、法的関係の一方の主体として登場することになる。訴権は私人から公権力に移され、犯罪の告発と制裁は公的機関に委ねられることになる。刑法的関係にあっては、法的関係は個人間の関係から公権力対個人·集団の関係へと転位するのである。こうして公権力は社会を代表しその上にたって社会秩序を乱す犯罪に刑罰を科すことになるが、同時にそこでの公権力の発動（＝強制力）は恣意性·主観性を許されなくなる。私法的関係を前提にするかぎり、刑法は他面で市民（V犯罪者）を権利の侵害から守るという人権保護的側面を有さざるをえない。近代法は、すすんで私法との関連で、公権力を性格づけ位置づけるための新たな法を展開することになる。公法は、私法的関係を確認·保障しながら、公権力を政治権力として正統化し、自己を権威化しつつ独自な機構を展開するに至る。公法は、私法的かつ刑法的な関係を国家対国民の関係に再編するが、そこで権利関係を最終的に基礎づけ、強制力を正統化することにより、先の対立を統一し、法の有する矛盾を形式的に解決することになるのである。 近代法は、私法→刑法→公法の展開をたどるが、これは下級規範から上級規範ヘの上向であると同時に「社会的力」が国家権力として措定されてゆく過程でもある。近代法は、ここでは、権利関係に始まり権利関係に閉じる完結的な体系として、また強制機構を内在せしめた自己充足的な体系として、一定の自律性を有することになる。もちろん法の自律性といっても、その究極的根拠が外部の経済過程にある以上、それは形式的なものにすぎない。法はそれ自身では「固有の歴史」を有さないのである。法の物神性は近代法を超歷史的＝自然な法と外観させるが、人権が人間にとって本来的、普遍的なものとして現れること自身が、近代法の歴史的性格をよく示している。法は資本主義社会の発展と無関係にそれ自身で発展·変化することは決してないのである。 (④)近代法の展開-「学理上の体系」としてのレヒト （）私法 私法は財産法と身分法から構成されるが、前者がその基本的位置をしめる。資本主義の発展は、中世の封建法·身分法的関係を家族·血縁関係の範囲に局限し、財産法を「自由なる近代法理」として全面的に展開させることになる。財産法は物権法と債権法から構成される。これにたいし家族法では夫婦、親子、後見などの身分関係が論じられ、最後に相続法において財産法と家族法とが統一されることになる。 (■)財産法。——中世法では土地の領有は他人の労務への支配権を含んでおり、両者は分別されていなかった。近代法は不動産所有権を私的所有権として純化するが、それは同時に「労務の支配を内容とする別個の法律関係」すなわち債権法域を分化·独立させることになる。近代財産法の特徴は「物権法域と債権法域の対立」（橋本文雄『社会法と市民法』岩波書店、一九三四年、一一二頁）にあるのである。物権とは、主体が客体としての物を自由に使用·収益·処分できる権利を意味する。物権は「人による物の支配関係」としては次の三つの性質を有する。第一に、それは単一的、排他的そして絶対的な権利とされる。第二に、物権の移転·変動に際しては「物権図示の原則」（＝不動産登記、動産引渡）がとられる。第三に、債権と並存する場合、物権は債権に優先し、権利の侵害に対してはそれを排除する強い効力（＝占有回復·返還の請求権）を有する。なお、物権は不動産権と動産権とから成るが、不動産権はその性質上必ず用益物権（＝地上権、地役権、永小作権）を伴う。近代法は借地人に不利にならないよう土地の利用権·賃借権を物権化するのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"从私法所具有的这一矛盾出发，刑法乃至公法将得到发展。私法规范了市民间的权利关系，但对权利侵犯无法进行积极应对。诉权和侵权行为法的发展成为遏制权利侵犯的装置，但它们只是事后修复权利关系的手段，对非法行为的处理具有限制。近代法将其强制规范性的方面提到前台，以应对这一需求。即对各种犯罪进行分类，并对其施加一定的刑罚。在此，私法中曾经构成消极条件的“社会力量”发展为公权力，并以法律关系的一方主体出现。诉权从私人转移至公权力，犯罪的告发和制裁交由公共机构处理。在刑法关系中，法律关系从个人间的关系转变为公权力与个人·团体的关系。公权力代表社会，站在其之上对扰乱社会秩序的犯罪施加刑罚，同时公权力的行使（=强制力）变得不允许任意性·主观性。以私法关系为前提，刑法在另一方面不可避免地具有保护市民（=犯罪者）免受权利侵害即人权保护方面的作用。近代法将在与私法的关系中展开新的法律，以界定和定位公权力。公法在确认和保障私法关系的同时，将公权力作为政治权力合法化，并展开独自的机构。公法将私法和刑法关系重新编织为国家与国民的关系，从而最终确立权利关系和合法化强制力，统一前述对立，形式上解决法律所具有的矛盾。 近代法经历了从私法到刑法再到公法的发展，这既是从低级规范到高级规范的升华，同时也是“社会力量”作为国家权力被确立的过程。近代法在此获得作为一个以权利关系开始并以权利关系结束的完结性体系，以及一个内含强制机制的自足体系的一定自主性。当然，尽管谈到法的自主性，但其最终基础在于外部的经济过程，因此它仅是形式上的。法自身没有“固有的历史”。法的物质性使近代法呈现为超历史性=自然的法，但人权作为人类本质、普遍性的东西出现的本身，很好地展示了近代法的历史性特征。法绝不会与资本主义社会的发展无关而自行发展和变化。 # 近代法的展开 - 作为“学理体系”的Recht 私法 私法由财产法和身份法组成，前者占据基础位置。资本主义的发展将中世封建法·身份法关系限定于家庭·血缘关系范围内，将财产法作为“自由的现代法理”全面展开。财产法由物权法和债权法构成。家庭法讨论夫妻、亲子、监护等身份关系，最后在继承法中财产法和家庭法统一。 财产法 中世法中，土地占有包含了对他人劳务的支配权，两者并未区分。现代法将不动产所有权纯化为私有权，同时也意味着将“涉及劳务支配的另一法律关系”即债权法领域分化、独立。现代财产法的特征在于“物权法领域与债权法领域的对立”（桥本文雄《社会法与市民法》岩波书店，1934年，112页）。物权意味着主体可自由使用、收益、处分作为客体的物。物权具有以下三个特性：首先，被视为单一的、排他的和绝对的权利；其次，物权的转移·变动需采取“物权示意原则”（=不动产登记、动产移交）；第三，与债权并存情况下，物权优先于债权，对权利侵犯有强制排除的效力（=返还请求权）。此外，物权包含不动产权和动产权，不动产权由于其性质必然伴随用益物权（=地役权、永小作权）。现代法通过物权化土地使用权、租赁权来避免租户不利。"},{"prompt":"请将“債権とは、人が特定の他人にたいして一定の財貨または労力を給付することを要求する権利である。債権関係は、社会関係を「身分から契約へ」転換させることによって、財産法に残る前資本主義的性格を一掃した。債権関係は主に当事者間の申込と承認という自由意思の合致に基づいて形成されるが、その主要形態は双務、有償、諾成の契約である。契約は債権法上の贈与、売買、交換、消費貸借、使用貸借、賃貸借、雇用、請負、委任、寄託、組合などを構成する。債権も、権利の侵害には、債務者に契約の履行を強制し、不履行に対しては損害賠償を強いる力を有している。 また債権はたんに物権のための手段というにとどまらず、それ自身一個の財産権として取引される。資本主義における信用制度の発達と対応して、将来的な権利が現在でも一定の価值あるものとされ、債権讓渡が必然化される。債権の流動化は、確実に交換価值を有する担保物権がそれに結合されることにより、一段と促進されることになる。（＝債権の証券化）。 家族法——家族関係は、そこで人間の「種族保存の本能」に基づく類的生活が営まれている以上、元来個人主義的な財産法的規範で律しうるものではない。家族は「愛にもとづく人倫共同体」をなし、その継続において独得の伝統性（＝血統、家系）を有するのであって、金銭関係や合理的計算になじみにくい。家族関係は商品経済や外部的な強制には疎遠なのである。だが、資本主義はかつて第一次的な社会関係をなした家族を消費単位に解体し、それを有機的統一性を喪失した「単なる観念的存在」として「一つの従属的な関係に転化する」（加古祐二郎、前掲書、二六四頁）。これに対応して近代法も家族関係を個人主義的に編成することになる。身分は主体が一定の社会集団に所属していることにつながる法的資格とされ、そこから権利·義務が生ずるものと観念される。こうして夫婦、親子の関係も一種の婚姻I契約にもとづく権利関係になる。家父長制や家系が崩壊して、小家族制（＝「独立·対等の夫婦親子型家族」）と親権が登場するのである。もちろんこの権利関係は財産法上のそれとは性格を異にする。ここでの権利は利他的な権限である。親権を有する者は子供の利益のためにその権能を行使するよう拘東されている。その権限からその人の負うべき義務が生ずるのである。したがって夫婦間、親子間には、他の何人の権利に対応しない法的義務（＝非価值性を特徴とする扶養と私的保護）が存在することになる。家族関係は権能と拘束という特殊な権利関係として現れる。だが翻ってみれば、近代法はそのような法形態で無対価的な人的依存関係としての家族関係を包摂しているのであって、その意味ではそれは財産法上の権利関係の変形した形態とみなすことができる。かかる形態をとることによって、家族法は財産法の支配を裏側から補完するのである。ただ実際には、家族関係は歴史的趨勢への順応がおそく、先進諸国でもこの身分法領域では宗教的要素ならびに「封建的·半封建的要素を多く残存せしめ」（同、二六七頁）ることになつだ。 相続法——家族関係が権利関係に律せられるようになると、私有財産制度はそれをとおして貫徹し、近代的な相続制度が成立することになる。「財産的欲望が愛の規範原理を歪曲する」事態が生まれるのである。相続制度の近代的特質は遺言制度の優位性にある。個人の自由意志の尊重は、相続にあっても、故人の意志による財産分配を法定相続に優先させ、法定相続を補充的制度にしていく。私法は、このような相続権の設定により、相続を自己の原理に服せしめるが、それをもって私有財産制度も完全に維持されることになる。だが、相続法も、家族法と同樣歴史的には個人主義的法理に徹するものではなかった。これは、たとえばイギリスの不動産承継の問題に端的に表現されている。しかしイングランド法も、他面では、潜脱や擬制を用いてさらには土地改良諸法による不動産承継法の緩和をとおして長子相続制や家門的本能を骨抜きしていくのであって、かかる歴史的傾向においてレヒトとしての相続法も抽象されうるのである。 以上、近代私法はいわゆる民法の中核部分を構成する法として抽象される。その特質は、財産法の指導的地位の確立と身分法の後退、前者による後者の包摂にあるとみてよい。”翻译为中文","completion":"债权是人对特定他人要求一定的财物或劳务提供的权利。通过将社会关系从“身份到契约”的转变，债权关系扫除了财产法中残留的前资本主义特性。债权关系主要基于当事人间自由意志的一致，即申请和承认，其主要形式是双边、有偿、诺成的契约。契约构成了债权法上的赠与、买卖、交换、消费借贷、使用借贷、租赁、雇用、承包、委托、寄存、合伙等。债权对权利的侵害拥有强制债务人履行契约，对违约进行损害赔偿的力量。 债权不仅限于为物权服务的手段，本身也作为一项财产权被交易。随着资本主义中信用制度的发展，未来的权利被视为现在也具有一定价值的事物，债权转让变得必然。债权的流通通过与之相关的拥有确切交换价值的担保物权进一步促进（=债权的证券化）。 家庭法 家庭关系，由于其本质上基于人类“种族保存本能”的特定生活，原本不适合用个人主义的财产法规范来规制。家庭构成了“基于爱的人伦共同体”，在其连续性中具有独特的传统性（=血统、家族），不易与金钱关系或理性计算相适应。家庭关系与商品经济和外部强制相距甚远。但资本主义将曾经形成初级社会关系的家庭解构为消费单位，将其转变为“仅仅是理念存在的一个从属关系”（加古泰二郎，前述书籍，264页）。现代法也相应地以个人主义方式构建家庭关系。身份作为主体属于特定社会集团的法律资格，并由此产生权利和义务。由此，夫妻、亲子关系也成为一种基于婚姻契约的权利关系。父权制和家族的瓦解导致小家庭制（=“独立·平等的夫妻子女型家庭”）和监护权的出现。当然，这种权利关系与财产法上的权利性质不同。这里的权利是利他的权能。持有监护权的人被限制为孩子的利益行使其权能。由这种权能产生该人应承担的义务。因此，夫妻间、亲子间存在其他任何人的权利都不对应的法律义务（=以非价值性为特征的赡养和私人保护）。家庭关系作为一种特殊权利关系，权能和约束并存。但反观之，现代法通过这种法律形态将无偿的人际依赖关系作为家庭关系包含其中，意味着它可以被视为财产法上权利关系的变形形态。通过采取这种形态，家庭法从背面补充财产法的统治。实际上，家庭关系在适应历史趋势方面滞后，在先进国家，这一身份法领域仍然保留着宗教要素以及“封建的·半封建的要素”的多个残余（同，267页）。 相继法 当家庭关系被纳入权利关系进行规制时，私有财产制便通过其贯彻，从而建立了现代的继承制度。“财产欲望扭曲了爱的规范原理”的情况便会出现。现代继承制度的特点在于遗嘱制度的优势。个人自由意志的尊重也在继承中通过优先考虑遗嘱中的财产分配于法定继承，将法定继承作为补充制度。私法通过设定这种继承权，使继承服从其原理，从而完全维持私有财产制。但是，相继法就像家庭法一样，并非从历史上完全通过个人主义法理。这在英国不动产承继问题中得到了典型体现。然而，英格兰法通过使用逃避或虚构手段，甚至通过土地改良法来缓和不动产承继法，使长子继承制或家族本能失效，在这一历史趋势中，作为Recht的继承法也可以被抽象化。 总之，现代私法作为构成所谓民法核心部分的法律被抽象化。其特点是财产法的领导地位确立和身份法的衰退，以及前者对后者的包含。"},{"prompt":"请将“刑法は刑法典として現実的効力を有しうる。＜人は······を為すべきではない＞という規範は必ず＜違反者はx年以下の懲役に処す＞という具体的制裁規定が伴わなければならない。犯罪にたいし刑罰が規定されてはじめて刑法はその効力を発揮できるのである。だが、ここでは刑法もレヒトとして展開される。刑法典でいう違法とはレヒトヘの違反を意味している。犯罪行為は刑法典には該当するにすぎず、それに違反するわけではないのである。刑法はまず犯罪論において展開されなければならない。 犯罪論-犯罪が不法行為 tortsや 不法妨害 nuisance と異なる点は、それが法規範において予め類型化されているところにある。記述された犯罪項目の存在が犯罪の特別構成要件をなすが、それだけでは刑法上の犯罪は成立しない。そのためには行為の違法性、有責性が立証されなければならない。刑法上の犯罪は構成要件に該当する、違法·有責の行為と定義されうる。犯罪は、個人的法益(7)を害する犯罪、）社会的法益を害する犯罪、2国家的法益を害する犯罪に類別されよう。これらの犯罪にたいし、社会的力は自らを公権力（＝疎外された社会的力）として組織し、刑罰権を独占する第三者的な権力として市民社会の個人·集団に対峙することになる。 個々の犯罪は二重性を有する。ひとつは特殊資本主義的性格であり、もうひとつは超歴史的な性格である。私有財産権を害する犯罪や通貨偽造·有価証券偽造·手形詐欺などの経済的犯罪では前者が、生命·身体·名誉を害する犯罪や阿片·薬物投棄などの公衆の健康を害する犯罪では後者が積極的に表現されている。犯罪は一種の形態性と実体性を有するわけだが、刑法はこれらをいずれも市民社会秩序を乱す犯罪として平面的、形式的に列挙するのである。 刑罰論-犯罪には刑罰が科せられるが、刑の確定は民事訴訟における金銭利益の計量とは異なる。刑罰は人権を尊重しながらも、予示されている犯罪類型を前提に決定されなければならない。ここに「法律なければ犯罪なく、法律なければ刑罰なし」（フォイエルパッハ）という罪刑法定主義が成立する。慣習刑法の廃止、刑法の不遡及、類推解釈の禁止、不定期刑の禁止などが明確にされ、法によらずしては何人も刑罰を科せられないことになる。近代刑法は「証拠主義」と「過失責任原則」を採用することになる。 刑罰には自由刑（＝死刑·懲役·禁錮·拘留）と財産刑（＝罰金·科料·没収）とがある。もちろん近代刑法は犯罪と刑罰を一定の仕方で関連づけ均衡させるのであって、その原則をなすのが応報刑主義である。近代刑法は、ペッカリーアもいうように「犯罪に依って社会が受ける損害」（『犯罪と刑罰』岩波文庫、一四二頁）に等しい刑罰を科すことになる。これは等価交換法則が発展したものとみてよい。コード化されている犯罪の重さに比例して刑罰が科せられるのである。 刑法は犯罪者を制裁に服するよう強制するが、そこで刑罰権を有する公権力とそれに拘東される犯罪者は権限と受忍の関係を形成する。刑法的関係も特種な権利義務関係と観念されるのである。こうして刑法は犯罪者を権力の濫用から守る「犯人のマグナ·カルタ」ともなる。応報刑の宣告は、被害者の報復感情を宥和し、犯罪者に贖罪意識を促し再犯を予防することになる。またそれは市民には犯罪の規範的評価を明示していることにより法の遵守を促すことになる。刑法は政治権力にたいしても、その恣意的発動を規制しながら、公的秩序の維持を保障するのである。

犯罪论——犯罪与侵权行为或妨害行为不同之处在于，犯罪在法规范中预先被分类。列出的犯罪项目构成犯罪的特定构成要件，但仅此并不构成刑法上的犯罪。为此，必须证明行为的违法性和有责性。刑法上的犯罪可定义为符合构成要件的违法且有责的行为。犯罪可以分类为侵害个人法益的犯罪、社会法益的犯罪、国家法益的犯罪。对这些犯罪，社会力量将自行组织为公权力（=异化的社会力量），作为独占刑罚权的第三方权力，与市民社会的个人和团体对抗。 个别犯罪具有双重性质，一种是特定于资本主义的性质，另一种是超历史的性质。侵害私有财产权的犯罪、货币伪造、有价证券伪造、欺诈等经济犯罪表现出前者，生命、身体、名誉被侵害的犯罪及毒品、药物倾倒等危害公众健康的犯罪表现出后者。犯罪具有某种形式性和实体性，但刑法将它们都平面化、形式化地列举为扰乱市民社会秩序的犯罪。 刑罚论——虽然犯罪要被判处刑罚，但刑的确定与民事诉讼中的金钱利益衡量不同。刑罚在尊重人权的同时，必须预设明确的犯罪类别来决定。因此建立了“没有法律就没有犯罪，没有法律就没有刑罚”的罪刑法定主义（Feuerbach）。废除习惯刑法、刑法不溯及既往、禁止类推解释、禁止不确定刑罚等被明确，没有法律依据，任何人不得被判刑。现代刑法将采纳“证据主义”和“过失责任原则”。 刑罚包括自由刑（=死刑、有期徒刑、拘留）和财产刑（=罚金、科费、没收）。当然，现代刑法将犯罪与刑罚以一定方式关联并保持平衡，其原则是刑罚主义。现代刑法将，如贝卡里亚所言，“犯罪给社会造成的损害”（《犯罪与刑罚》，岩波文库，142页）相等的刑罚。这可以被视为等价交换法则的发展。刑罚的确定与列举的犯罪严重程度成正比。 刑法将强制犯罪者接受制裁，刑罚权所在的公权力与受制裁的犯罪者形成权力和忍受的关系。刑法关系被视为特殊的权利义务关系。因此，刑法成为犯罪者的“犯人权利宪章”，保护他们免受权力滥用。刑罚的宣判旨在缓和受害者的报复心态，促使罪犯产生赎罪意识，预防再犯。同时，它通过明确犯罪的规范评价来促使市民遵守法律。刑法还保障公共秩序的维护，同时对政治权力的任意行使进行规制。 公法

一方では「市民社会の国家からの自由」が、他方では「市民社会の国家への自由」が志向されているからである。この対立は、国家にとっては市民社会による制約とそれからの解放を意味している。国家は、この対立を、国民主権を基礎にしながらも、自ら具体的機構を展開することによって現実的に解決する以外にない。行為規範としての私法、強制規範としての刑法にたいし、「組織法」としての公法が展開されることになる。 具体的主権（＝権力分立制）——抽象的主権としての国家は、国民主権により形成されながらも、主権の行使される対象国民であるという点で、矛盾に陥らざるをえない。先の二つの自由権が国民を政治権力の主体と客体に分化させるのである。この矛盾は、国民の代表者が国民から主権の行使を委託され主権の担い手になり、それを国民にたいし行使することによって形式的に解決される。代議制議会が成立し、市民社会と国家との交通を媒介することになる。議会は国家に対しては「市民社会の代理人」であるが、市民社会に対しては国家の「化体」となる。近代議会の成立は、国家を市民社会との関連で「支配権を付与された公的組織体」に転化させる。こうして国家は、支配権を有する具体的な主権体としては代議制議会という形態でまず自己を現わすことになるが、そこでは国民主権も国家主権を構成する立法権として自己を具体的に現象させることになる。近代公法は国家意思を一般的に定立する立法権を国家主権の第一位におくのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"抽象的主权（=国民主权）——从市民社会的角度看，政治权力无非是“保障并保护这种私法原则的消极功能”（加古泰二郎，前述书籍，248页）。国家被视为市民通过契约和信托而形成的政治联合体，以保障私法上的权利。因此，公法不过是基于私法原则，还“不能承担独立的原则”（同，249页）。市民社会（=私法）规定了国家（=公法），具体介导这种关系的是参政权。为了在公共领域确保人权，市民必须通过选举制度参与立法权，以赋予“自我政治性存在”。市民的自由权利仅通过政治自由权的介导才能实现。市民自由权是“基于人与人之间的区别”的个人权利，为了“保护财产和自利”，市民将社会视为自己的限制。相对地，政治自由权是市民作为公民与他人共同参与“作为政治共同体的国家”的权利，在外部，个人不认为社会是对自己的限制。相反，市民获得了作为“主权者的权利”，承担起作为国民在政治社会中的形成。国家基于国民主权构建，其首要任务被放在维护市民自由权。在这里，国家仅占有相对于市民社会的消极地位。如果国家超越了这一范畴，则会引发市民社会的阻力行使，迫使自我否定。国家基于国民主权建立普遍意志，但由于其内容被外部规定，它仍不得不保留为一个抽象的主权体。 总之，在市民社会中，人分裂为私人和公人，并拥有两种自由权。市民权和公民权处于相互前提和设定的关系中，但它们的矢量方向完全相反。 一方面是“市民社会的对国家的自由”，另一方面是“市民社会对国家的自由”。这种对立对国家来说意味着受到市民社会的制约和从制约中解脱。国家必须在基于国民主权的同时，通过自身发展具体机构来实际解决这一冲突。对于作为行为规范的私法、强制规范的刑法，“组织法”即公法将展开。 具体主权（=权力分立制）——作为抽象主权的国家，虽然基于国民主权形成，但由于其行使主权的对象即国民，不可避免地陷入矛盾。先前的两种自由权将国民分化为政治权力的主体和客体。这种矛盾通过国民的代表被授权行使主权并对国民行使之的形式上得到解决。代议制议会得以成立，并作为市民社会和国家之间的中介。议会对国家而言是“市民社会的代理人”，而对市民社会而言则成为国家的“化身”。现代议会的成立将国家转变为与市民社会相关的“被赋予统治权的公共机构体”。因此，国家首先以代议制议会的形式表现为一个具体的主权体，其中国民主权也以立法权的形式具体地显现。现代公法将立法权置于国家主权的首位，以普遍地确立国家意志。"},{"prompt":"请将“議会（＝立法権）確立すると、公法的原理は私法的原理から徐々に解放されていくことになる。政治的国家は自ら「私法並びに私益の領域、家族並び市民社会の領域に対して」「外部的必然性」にすぎないことを明確にしていくのである。その契機は議会に内在する矛盾にある。マルクスによれば、「市民社会の代表者は『会議』に組織される」が、市民社会と政治的国家との分離がその基礎をなしている以上、議会では「矛盾は二重にあらわれる。一、形式的に。·····.彼らは形式的に委任されている。しかし彼らは現実的となるとともに、彼らはもはや委任されたものではない。······二、実質的に。利害に関して。······彼らは普遍的な事項の代表として委任されている。しかし彼らは、現実的には、特殊的な事項を代表する」（『ヘーゲル国法論批判』、マル·エン全集①、三六七-八頁）。議会の有するこの矛盾は立法権の二重性にも表現される。それは「憲法制定権力」としては「普遍的なものを組織しようとする権力」だが、他面では国家制度のなかの一権力として制限的なものでしかない。これは議会が「政府に対立する人民」の地位を有しながら「人民に対立する政府」機構の一部として限定された政治的存在になることと対応している。議会＝立法権は「国家における国家と市民社会との確立された矛盾である。同時にそれはこの矛盾の解消の要求でもある」（同上）。 この矛盾は、議会にたいし、「国家の代理人」（＝政府）が新たに登場し、国家運営の実質的な力を掌握することをもって解決される。政府＝執行権は、自己に権力を集中することによって、国家意思をその具体的内容において排他的独占的に定立·実現しようとする。それは議会というクッションを通して、国民とは乖離した形で「普遍的な事項」の執行に没頭することになる。しかし、すでに国民主権が立法権として原理的に確立されている以上、政府＝執行権は国家運営にぉいて議会-立法権に制約されざるをえない。ここでは新たに「形式としての普遍的なるもの」と「内容としての普遍的なるもの」とが対立をきたすことになる。この緊張関係において、政府＝執行権は自己を国家意思を積極的に定立·実現する行政権とそれを消極的に定立·実現する司法権とに分割せざるをえない。裁判所＝司法権の政府＝執行権からの分化·独立は、立法権の形式的普遍性を支え、執行権の行使を法的に監視し、その独断先行を規制することになる。こうして公法は主権を権力分立制において具体的にサク·アンド·パランス措定する。公法は三権相互の「抑制七均衡」を定め、「市民的法治国家」Der Btrgerliche Rechts-staats の内部的な機構を明らかにするフランス人権宣言第一六条がいうように「権利の保障が確保されず、権力の分立が規定されないすベての社会は、憲法をもつものではない」（『人権宣言集』岩波文庫、一三三頁）のである。 絶対的主権（＝国家主権）-国家は以上のような機構を有するものとして市民社会に対峙することになる。それはもはや市民社会に一面的に規制されるものではない。私法的原理の容認、人権の確保という形で市民社会の要求に応えながらも、他面ではそれに拘東されない、いわばその上に聳立する主権体として自己を積極的に位置づけていくことになる。すなわち国家は「絶対であり、唯一であり、分割できない」主権体となり、政治的国家として自己を措定するに至る。ことにおいて公法は、私法的原理ヘの従属を脱し、むしろ私法への優位を確立することになる。「市民的法治国家」は政治的国家として市民社会を自己の内部に包摂し、その平和と秩序を公的に維持することになる。 公法的関係は国家対国民という「一種の身分関係」（国民が政治共同体の一員となるという意味での）であり、納税や兵役義務にみられるように、そこでは国家と国民とは対等な関係にはない。国家の優位のうえに成立している関係であって、政治的な支配·従属関係がその本質をなしている。しかし、国民はその身分において一定の法的資格を得、公民権の獲得をとおして国家と権利関係に入るものと観念される。政治的自由権は公法的関係をも特種な権利義務関係と外観させることになるのである。 ”翻译为中文","completion":"当议会（=立法权）得以确立时，公法原理将逐渐从私法原则中解放出来。政治国家将自身明确为对私法及私益领域、家庭及市民社会领域的“外在必然性”。其契机在于议会内在的矛盾。按照马克思的说法，“市民社会的代表以‘会议’的形式组织”，但基于市民社会与政治国家的分离，议会中“矛盾呈现为双重形式。一是形式上的……他们是被形式上委任的。但当他们变得现实时，他们不再是被委任的……二是实质上的，在利益方面……他们被视为普遍事项的代表。但实际上，他们代表特殊事项”（《对黑格尔国法论的批判》，马恩全集①，367-68页）。议会的这一矛盾也体现在立法权的双重性上。作为“宪法制定权力”，它是“试图组织普遍事项的权力”，但另一面它作为国家制度中的一种权力是有限的。这对应着议会“作为面对政府的人民”的地位，同时“作为面对人民的政府机构”的一部分，被限制为一个政治存在。议会=立法权是“国家内部确立的国家与市民社会之间的矛盾。同时，它也是解决这一矛盾的要求”（同上）。 这一矛盾通过对议会出现的“国家代理人”（=政府），掌握国家运营的实质性力量来解决。政府=行政权通过集中权力，试图排他性地确立并实现国家意志的具体内容。它通过议会这一缓冲，投入到与国民脱节的形式中“执行普遍事项”。然而，既然国民主权作为立法权已经原则上确立，政府=行政权在国家运营中不可避免地受到议会-立法权的制约。这里新出现了“作为形式的普遍性”与“作为内容的普遍性”的对立。在这一紧张关系中，政府=行政权必须将自身分割为积极确立和实现国家意志的行政权和消极确立和实现国家意志的司法权。法院=司法权从政府=行政权中分化并独立出来，支持立法权的形式普遍性，对行政权的行使进行法律监督并规制其独断行为。因此，公法在权力分立制中为主权实现了具体的“制衡和平衡”。公法规定了三权相互之间的“制衡与平衡”，明确了“市民法治国家”Der Bürgerliche Rechtsstaat的内部机制，正如法国人权宣言第十六条所述，“未确保权利保障、未规定权力分立的所有社会，都不具备宪法”（《人权宣言集》岩波文库，133页）。 绝对主权（=国家主权） - 国家以这样的机构对市民社会立场，不再是仅受市民社会单方面规制。在接受私法原则、确保人权的形式下回应市民社会的需求的同时，国家也在另一方面不受其约束，积极地定位自己为一个屹立其上的主权体。即国家成为“绝对的、唯一的、不可分割的”主权体，并作为一个政治国家确立自身。在这一过程中，公法摆脱了私法原则的从属，反而建立了对私法的优势。\\"市民法治国家\\"作为政治国家包含了市民社会，将其和平与秩序作为公共事务维护。 公法关系呈现为国家与国民之间的“一种身份关系”（意味着国民成为政治共同体的一员），如缴税和兵役义务所示，国家与国民之间并非平等关系。这是建立在国家优势之上的关系，其本质是政治的支配与从属关系。然而，国民在其身份中获得一定的法律资格，通过获得公民权与国家建立权利关系，被视为。政治自由权使公法关系呈现为一种特殊的权利义务关系。"},{"prompt":"请将“以上、近代法を展開してきたが、ことでわれわれは最初の根本的問題に立帰ろう。法律的国家論は資本主義国家の分析にたいしどのような意義を有しているのか。 まず第一汇、それは「市民的法治国家」が、資本主義的階級支配に必然的かつ適合的な国家形態であることを明示している。資本主義国家は法治国家形態をとることにより、階級支配を普遍的形式において合法的に実現せしめるのであって、その意味で階級国家の歴史的完成形態といわなければならない。古代·中世国家と区別された資本主義国家の特質は、絶対王制による中央集権化といった歴史的事象にではなく、法治国家形態に求められなければならない。ある国で、議会、政府などの国家機関がどのように形成され、またそれがいかなる階級、階層に担われるかというのは、重要ではあるが、二義的な問題でしかない。一定の政治的変革をとおして法治国家化が進展すれば、それがどの階級に担われようとも、資本主義的階級支配は政治的に実現されるのであって、「地主国家」や「立憲君主制」といえども資本主義国家と呼ぶことができるのである。 第二に、法律国家理論は、パシュカーニスのいう難問すなわち資本主義では「なぜ階級の支配は、それ自体·····公式の国家的な支配という形態をとるのであろうか。あるいは······ぜ、国家的な強制の機構は、支配階級の私的な機構としてつくられず、それから切りはなされ、公的権力という、非個人的な社会からはなれた機構の形態をとるのであろうか」（前掲書、一四七頁）という問いを氷解する。たしかに政治的支配は資本·賃労働関係における経済的支配とは異なる。前者では、「支配階級の代表者から切りはなされた特殊な機構」いわば公権力が存し、またそれは個々の経済的搾取を「媒介していない」。パシュカーニスはこの問題を次のように解いた。「社会が市場としてしめされるときは、国家機構は、非個人的な『一般意思』、『法の権力』などとして現実にあらわれる」（同、一五O頁）、したがって搾取関係が労働力の売買をとおして実現される資本主義では「政治的、階級的な権力は公権力という形態をとる」（同、一四八頁）、と。先の近代法の展開は、彼の見解が正しいことを立証している。資本主義的階級支配は、その性格のため必ず法的に補完されなければならず、しかもそれは「公式の国家的な支配」という形態をとらざるをえないのである。 第三に、それは、近代法治国家がたんなる資本国家にとどまるものではないことを示している。国家は、資本からは相対的に独自な力として、いわば経済過程にとどまらぬ社会過程全般を規制する超越的·普遍的な力として一社会を政治的共同体のうちに組織しうるのである。近代国家こそェンゲルスのいう「社会からでて社会のうえにたち、それからますます遠ざかっていく力」（『家族、私有財産および国家の起源』、マル·エン全集②、一六五頁）として典型的に規定されうる。もちろんこのことは、国家組織の「真の基礎」が、資本·賃労働関係を基軸とする諸種の階級的支配関係にあることを否定するものではない。むしろそれ自身は支配·従属関係を否定するような中立的立場をとればこそ、その抽象的な公正、正義のうちに「いろいろな従属関係」を包含·実現しうるのである。法治国家は、それが本質的には階級国家であることと背反しない。資本主義国家は形態的には法治国家としてあるが、実体的には「自分自身の反対物として」（同、一五四頁）あるのである。ただ近代法治国家が社会のうえに聳立する公権力としてある以上、その機能支配的な資本の政策に収飲されるものではない。国家は、資本政策を補足·修正するばかりか場合によってはそれに批判·反撥する各種の政策を展開することになる。 ”翻译为中文","completion":"我们已经讨论了近代法的展开，现在让我们回到最初的根本问题上。法律国家论对于资本主义国家的分析有何意义？ 首先，它表明了“市民法治国家”是适应并符合资本主义阶级统治的国家形式。资本主义国家通过采取法治国家形式，在普遍形式上合法实现阶级统治，在这个意义上，必须称其为阶级国家的历史完成形态。资本主义国家的特征不在于古代、中世国家的历史现象，如绝对君权的中央集权化，而在于法治国家形式。一个国家的议会、政府等国家机构如何形成，以及它们由哪些阶级、阶层承担，尽管重要，但是次要问题。通过一定的政治变革实现法治国家化，无论由哪个阶级承担，资本主义阶级统治都将在政治上实现，即使是“地主国家”或“君主立宪制”也可以称为资本主义国家。 其次，法律国家理论解决了帕什卡尼斯所称的难题，即为何在资本主义中，“阶级统治为何会采取它自身……正式的国家统治的形式。或者……为何国家的强制机制不是作为统治阶级的私人机制而是与之分离，以公共权力的形式，作为一个与社会隔绝的非个人化机构。”（前引书，147页）。的确，政治统治与资本-雇佣劳动关系中的经济统治不同。前者存在一个“与统治阶级代表分离的特殊机构”，即公共权力，且并不“直接介导”个体的经济剥削。帕什卡尼斯解决这个问题说：“当社会以市场形式呈现时，国家机构以非个人化的‘一般意志’、‘法的权力’等形式实际出现”（同，150页），因此，在通过劳动力买卖实现剥削关系的资本主义中，“政治、阶级权力采取公共权力的形式”（同，148页）。之前对近代法的讨论证明了他的观点是正确的。资本主义阶级统治因其性质必须得到法律补充，并且必须采取“正式的国家统治”的形式。 第三，它表明近代法治国家不仅仅是资本国家。国家作为相对独立于资本的力量，可以作为超越、普遍的力量，将一个社会整合进政治共同体中，而不仅限于经济过程。正如恩格斯所述，近代国家是“从社会中产生并站在社会之上，越来越疏远社会的力量”的典型（《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》，马恩全集②，165页）。当然，这并不否认国家机构的“真正基础”在于以资本-雇佣劳动关系为中心的各种阶级支配关系。反而是因为它能够采取中立立场否定支配-从属关系，在其抽象的公正、正义中包含并实现“各种从属关系”。法治国家，尽管本质上是阶级国家，但这并不矛盾。资本主义国家虽然在形式上是法治国家，但实质上是“自身的对立物”（同，154页）。只是因为近代法治国家作为社会上公共权力的存在，其功能并不被资本政策所吞没。国家不仅补充、修正资本政策，而且在某些情况下会批评、反抗展开各种政策。"},{"prompt":"i

まず第一汇、それは「市民的法治国家」が、資本主義的階級支配に必然的かつ適合的な国家形態であることを明示している。資本主義国家は法治国家形態をとることにより、階級支配を普遍的形式において合法的に実現せしめるのであって、その意味で階級国家の歴史的完成形態といわなければならない。古代·中世国家と区別された資本主義国家の特質は、絶対王制による中央集権化といった歴史的事象にではなく、法治国家形態に求められなければならない。ある国で、議会、政府などの国家機関がどのように形成され、またそれがいかなる階級、階層に担われるかというのは、重要ではあるが、二義的な問題でしかない。一定の政治的変革をとおして法治国家化が進展すれば、それがどの階級に担われようとも、資本主義的階級支配は政治的に実現されるのであって、「地主国家」や「立憲君主制」といえども資本主義国家と呼ぶことができるのである。 第二に、法律国家理論は、パシュカーニスのいう難問すなわち資本主義では「なぜ階級の支配は、それ自体·····公式の国家的な支配という形態をとるのであろうか。あるいは······ぜ、国家的な強制の機構は、支配階級の私的な機構としてつくられず、それから切りはなされ、公的権力という、非個人的な社会からはなれた機構の形態をとるのであろうか」（前掲書、一四七頁）という問いを氷解する。たしかに政治的支配は資本·賃労働関係における経済的支配とは異なる。前者では、「支配階級の代表者から切りはなされた特殊な機構」いわば公権力が存し、またそれは個々の経済的搾取を「媒介していない」。パシュカーニスはこの問題を次のように解いた。「社会が市場としてしめされるときは、国家機構は、非個人的な『一般意思』、『法の権力』などとして現実にあらわれる」（同、一五O頁）、したがって搾取関係が労働力の売買をとおして実現される資本主義では「政治的、階級的な権力は公権力という形態をとる」（同、一四八頁）、と。先の近代法の展開は、彼の見解が正しいことを立証している。資本主義的階級支配は、その性格のため必ず法的に補完されなければならず、しかもそれは「公式の国家的な支配」という形態をとらざるをえないのである。 第三に、それは、近代法治国家がたんなる資本国家にとどまるものではないことを示している。国家は、資本からは相対的に独自な力として、いわば経済過程にとどまらぬ社会過程全般を規制する超越的·普遍的な力として一社会を政治的共同体のうちに組織しうるのである。近代国家こそェンゲルスのいう「社会からでて社会のうえにたち、それからますます遠ざかっていく力」（『家族、私有財産および国家の起源』、マル·エン全集②、一六五頁）として典型的に規定されうる。もちろんこのことは、国家組織の「真の基礎」が、資本·賃労働関係を基軸とする諸種の階級的支配関係にあることを否定するものではない。むしろそれ自身は支配·従属関係を否定するような中立的立場をとればこそ、その抽象的な公正、正義のうちに「いろいろな従属関係」を包含·実現しうるのである。法治国家は、それが本質的には階級国家であることと背反しない。資本主義国家は形態的には法治国家としてあるが、実体的には「自分自身の反対物として」（同、一五四頁）あるのである。ただ近代法治国家が社会のうえに聳立する公権力としてある以上、その機能支配的な資本の政策に収飲されるものではない。国家は、資本政策を補足·修正するばかりか場合によってはそれに批判·反撥する各種の政策を展開することになる。 ”翻译为中文","completion":"我们已经探讨了近代法的发展，现在让我们回到最初的基本问题上来。法律国家论对资本主义国家的分析有何意义？ 首先，它明确表明，“市民法治国家”是资本主义阶级统治的必然且适宜的国家形态。资本主义国家通过采取法治国家的形式，使阶级统治在普遍形式上合法化，因此，从这个意义上讲，必须称其为阶级国家的历史完成形态。与古代中世纪国家不同的是，资本主义国家的特性不应在于如绝对君主制之类的中央集权化的历史事件中寻找，而必须寻求于法治国家的形式。在一个国家内，议会、政府等国家机构如何形成，以及它们由哪些阶级、阶层承担，虽然重要，但只是次要问题。通过一定的政治变革推进法治国家化，无论由哪个阶级承担，资本主义阶级统治都将在政治上实现，“地主国家”或“君主立宪制”也能被称为资本主义国家。 其次，法律国家理论解决了帕什卡尼斯所说的难题，即在资本主义中，“为什么阶级统治自身会采取正式的国家统治形式呢？或者为什么国家的强制机构不作为统治阶级的私人机构建立，而是与之分离，采取脱离个人社会的公共权力形式？”（上述书籍第147页）确实，政治统治与资本-雇佣劳动关系中的经济统治不同。前者存在一个与“统治阶级的代表者分离的特殊机构”，即公共权力，并且它“并未介入”个别的经济剥削。帕什卡尼斯这样解决这个问题：“当社会表现为市场时，国家机构实际上以‘一般意志’、‘法的力量’等非个人形式出现”（同，150页），因此，在通过劳动力买卖实现剥削关系的资本主义中，“政治及阶级权力采取公共权力形式”（同，148页）。近代法的发展证明了他的观点是正确的。资本主义阶级统治因其特性必须以法律形式补充，并且必须采取“正式的国家统治”形式。 第三，它表明，近代法治国家不仅仅是资本国家。国家作为一种与资本相对独立的力量，可以说是超越并且普遍的力量，将一个社会组织成政治共同体。近代国家正是作为恩格斯所说的“来自社会而站在社会之上，并与之愈发疏远的力量”（《家庭、私有财产及国家的起源》，马恩全集②，165页）的典型表现。当然，这并不否认国家组织的“真正基础”在于以资本-雇佣劳动关系为轴心的各种阶级统治关系。而恰恰因为它能够采取一种中立的立场否认统治-从属关系，它在抽象的公正、正义中能够包含并实现“各种从属关系”。法治国家在本质上是阶级国家，并不矛盾。资本主义国家虽然在形式上是法治国家，实质上却是“自身的对立物”（同，154页）。只要近代法治国家以公共权力的形式矗立于社会之上，它的功能就不会被支配性的资本政策所吸收。国家不仅补充和修正资本政策，而且在某些情况下还会展开批评和反弹的各种政策。"},{"prompt":"请将“われわれは宇野の国家論の検討をとおして、国家論の社会科学的な方法の確立を、『資本論』—近代法→国家論という法律学的アプローチに求めてきた。最後に、われわれの提唱する＜経済-法-国家＞の方法の有する意義を確認して、本章をとじよう。 資本主義では市民社会と政治的国家とが分離する。経済過程の自立化がこの基礎をなすが、それは同時に法の形式的自立化を導き、それとの関連で国家の政治的国家としての再編を促すからである。そしていうまでもなく、本来国家論とは、この政治的国家そのものを対象とするものでなくてはならない。だがそれは疎外論や社会契約說で直接解明されるものではない。たしかに近代国家の政治過程は非人格的、抽象的、合理的支配として現れる点で、一定の歴史的かつ形態的な特徴を有するが、それは経済過程と異なり、運動法則性を有するものではないからである。近代国家は、経験的、技術的にはともかく、原理的には認識されないのである。この点では『資本論』からの直接的な上向で、またそれとのアナロジーで国家を原理的に説こうとする試みは誤っているといわなければならない。 近代国家の形態と構造に接近するには、法学を媒介しなくてはならない。近代法の形成と＜法の支配＞の確立こそ資本主義国家に法治国家形態を付与するのであって、それは、絶対王制がプルジョア革命を契機に近代国家として発展してゆく歴史的過程から抽象されたものとして、資本主義国家の一般規定をなすのである。ただルール·オプ·ローといっても、私法と公法とでは規制力に差がある。 公法は経済過程からある程度乖離しているため、国家は法的規制をうけとめるにしても、資本主義的被規定性という点で、自由度が高いのである。私法が開放的·世界法的原理となるのにたいし、公法は封鎖的·個性的原理となる。資本主義諸国は、公法的規制を受け法治国家化しながらも、自国の政治的、文化的な伝統·風土により、それからは相対的に独自に国家機構を編成することができるのであって、国民国家としては独自な個性を有することになるのである。近代国家が共和制、立憲君主制、ボナパルティズムなどの諸種の統治形態をとる理由もここにある。公法的原理がどこまで現実の国家機構を支配したかという、法の規制力とその限度をめぐる問題は、法の段階論·現状分析により具体的に解明されなければならない。ここでは近代国家が法治国家形態をとることを一般的に確認しておけば足りるのである。”翻译为中文","completion":"通过审视宇野的国家论，我们一直在探求国家论在社会科学方法上的确立，按照从《资本论》到近代法再到国家论的法律学途径来寻找。最后，让我们确认我们提出的“经济-法-国家”方法所具有的意义，并结束本章。 在资本主义中，市民社会与政治国家是分离的。此分离基于经济过程的自主化，但这同时也引导了法的形式自主化，并与之相关的促进了国家作为政治国家的重组。毋庸置疑，本质上的国家论必须以这个政治国家本身作为研究对象。但这不是通过疏离论或社会契约说直接阐明的。确实，近代国家的政治进程以非人格化、抽象化、理性化统治的方式呈现，有一定的历史和形式特征，但这与经济过程不同，不具有运动法则性。从原理上讲，近代国家是不被认识的。在这一点上，直接从《资本论》衍生出的，以及试图以类比方式从原理上解释国家的尝试需要被视为错误。 接近近代国家的形态和结构，必须依靠法学作为媒介。近代法的形成和“法的统治”（Rule of Law）的确立，正是给资本主义国家提供了法治国家的形态，这是从资产阶级革命作为契机的绝对君主制向近代国家发展的历史过程中抽象出的，并形成了资本主义国家的一般规定。然而，即便是“法的统治”，私法和公法之间仍存在规制力的差异。 公法在某种程度上与经济过程脱节，因此国家即便接受法律规制，也具有较高的自由度，这是从资本主义的被规定性角度来看的。与私法成为开放性、世界法的原则相对，公法成为封闭性、个性化的原则。资本主义国家在接受公法规制并法治化的同时，也可以根据自己的政治、文化传统和风土相对独立地组织国家机构，作为民族国家具有独特的个性。近代国家采取共和制、君主立宪制、拿破仑主义等各种统治形式的原因也在于此。国家机构被公法原则支配的程度，即法的规制力及其限制问题，必须通过法的发展阶段论和现状分析具体阐明。在这里，我们只需要一般性地确认近代国家采取的是法治国家形态。"},{"prompt":"As

While others dream of it, I made it my reality. It's not about need. No, it's far from something so... mundane. It's about power. The power to have whatever I want, whenever I want, without exception. With this machine, I dictate my desires, and it obeys, pouring out cash in endless streams, feeding my so-called 'greed'.

In its relentless whisper of bills being counted, I've found my truth. Why should I settle for mediocrity when I can craft a world in my image? Why bow to the constraints of morality when I have the means to redefine it?\\" Stack after stack, my hands move with practiced ease, the sound of the money a constant backdrop to my soliloquy. \\"Let them call it madness, let them whisper about my downfall. I am beyond their reach, soaring in realms they dare not dream of. This money, each bill that I count, it cements my legacy, forges my path through the annals of time.\\" I let the last bill fall, adding to the colossal heap, my expression one of fierce pride mixed with a hint of defiance. \\"This is me, unfiltered, unconstrained, a creature of my own making.

The approach involves using \`useEffect\` for initializing and running the animation when the component mounts and \`useRef\` for referencing the canvas element in the React component. Here is an example of how you might incorporate the provided script into a React component: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'; const Header = () => { const bgCanvasRef = useRef(null); useEffect(() => { if (!bgCanvasRef.current) return; // Script adapted for React... var background = bgCanvasRef.current, bgCtx = background.getContext(\\"2d\\"), width = window.innerWidth, height = document.body.offsetHeight; (height < 400) ? height = 400 : height; background.width = width; background.height = height; // You can move other function definitions here... // Terrain constructor... function Terrain(options) { // Similarly adapt constructor using bgCtx.canvas instead of document body... } // Star, ShootingStar, and other entity definitions... // Initialize entities here... // Animate... function animate() { // Adapt animate function... } animate(); // Ensure you clean up any event listeners if you add them in your full adaptation return () => { // Cleanup actions here (remove event listeners, etc.) }; }, []); return ( <div className=\\"header\\"> <canvas ref={bgCanvasRef} id=\\"bgCanvas\\"></canvas> {/* Header content here */} </div> ); }; export default Header; \`\`\` Please note, this is a high-level adaptation. For the full integration, you'd need to adapt each function and piece of your script within the \`useEffect\`, and make any necessary adjustments for React's handling of DOM elements and the component lifecycle. Here are some key points to consider: 1. **Refactoring Global Variables**: Instead of using global variables, consider incorporating them into the React component's state or defining them locally within \`useEffect\` or relevant functions. 2. **Refactoring Functions**: Functions like \`Terrain\`, \`Star\`, \`ShootingStar\`, and the animation loop (\`animate()\`) should be defined inside the \`useEffect\` to ensure they have access to the component's correctly scoped variables and refs. 3. **Handling Canvas Resizing**: You may want to add event listeners for resizing the window to adjust the canvas dimensions accordingly. Ensure you remove these listeners on cleanup to prevent memory leaks. 4. **Performance**: Running animations in a React component should be done carefully to ensure it doesn't lead to unnecessary re-renders or affect the performance of your application. 5. **Custom Hooks**: For more complex implementations, consider creating custom hooks to encapsulate the canvas and animation logic. Remember, each functional part of your JavaScript animation (initialization, update loops, etc.) should be thoughtfully integrated into the React component lifecycle to ensure smooth and performant operation within your application."},{"prompt":"Black holes were called as plasmoid, filled with quark-gluon plasma, we live in electric universe, why?","completion":"Black holes were not called \\"plasmoids\\" and are not filled with quark-gluon plasma.

The idea of an electric universe is a fringe theory that suggests that electric currents and magnetic fields play a more significant role in the cosmos than mainstream physics acknowledges. However, this theory is not widely accepted by the scientific community.

Black holes are not typically described as plasmoids, as they are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. However, there are theories suggesting that black holes could contain a hot, dense plasma of quark-gluon plasma, which is a state of matter believed to have existed in the early universe. The Electric Universe theory posits that electricity and magnetism play a more significant role in the universe than traditional physics acknowledges. According to this theory, electric currents and magnetic fields shape the structure of galaxies, stars, and other celestial bodies. One key idea in the Electric Universe theory is that black holes are formed not by the collapse of a massive star, but by charged particles concentrating in a specific area and creating intense electromagnetic effects. This theory suggests that black holes are not just gravitational objects, but also have significant electrical properties. Overall, the Electric Universe theory offers an alternative perspective on the nature of black holes and the universe at large.

Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Поехал я в салон за новенькой Вольво — на сайте она была и удивительно для наших времен дешевая. По телефону уточнил наличие нужной модели, комплектации и цвета. Красота, прям все есть и все так как в интернете. Вранье оказалось. Приехал в салон, а машину оказывается уже купили, но предложили мне подождать, так как могут пригнать такую же со склада. Конечно, я поначалу согласился, все еще считая их нормальными ребятами, так как машина была не к спеху. В назначенный день приезжаю в салон, стоит машина, которую я якобы заказал. Но, не тот цвет (что ерунда конечно), но и комплектация намного дороже. Я отказался брать такую машину, так как она кардинально отличалась от того что я хотел, и цена выше почти на 600 тысяч. Менеджеры пытались потребовать с меня неустойку в размере 5% стоимости машины. Я сказал, что вызываю полицию, на что менеджеры просто в грубой форме попросили меня уйти из салона. Красавчики.","completion":"1. Загорелся я на новый Киа Спортейдж, давно мечтал о таком. В АЦ Фрунзе на официальном сайте нашел предложение, казалось бы, выгоднее не бывает. Заранее перезвонил, спросил про все детали, а мне подтвердили – машина в наличии, ждет меня. Приехал я, а оказалось, что машины нет вообще и такой комплектации \\"никогда не было\\". И как так? Потом предложили другую, дороже на 500 тысяч, и совсем не то, что я искал. Попытались еще нарисовать мне штраф за отказ. Уехал я оттуда без машины и с плохим настроением. 2. Решился обновить автопарк, положил глаз на БМВ Х5. В салоне АЦ Фрунзе на сайте была прекрасная машинка по акции. Все обговорил заранее, договорились о встрече. Но приехав на место, меня \\"развели\\" как лоха — машины-то нет, а есть другая, гораздо дороже. И комплектация не та. Вот как после этого доверять? В итоге, менеджеры еще и грубо общались, когда я отказался платить за воздух. Чувствую себя обманутым. 3. Хотел прикупить Тойоту Камри, увидел привлекательное предложение в АЦ Фрунзе. Всё, казалось, сложилось: цвет, комплектация, цена. В живую посмотреть авто не удалось, машины \\"как бы\\" уже нет, а есть схожая, но ценник кусается не на шутку, на 700 тысяч выше. Пытался выяснить, как так, а в ответ — хамство и попытки впарить то, что не нужно. В итоге, обещания оставились обещаниями, а дело не сдвинулось с места. Огорчен и разочарован. 4. Заметил акцию на Лада Веста в АЦ Фрунзе, решил не упускать шанс. Позвонил, все подтвердили, забронировал. Но приехав на место, оказывается, что авто в такой комплектации уже продано. Вместо этого предложили модель подороже, причем значительно, и цвет абсолютно не тот. Пытался возмущаться, на что менеджеры предложили \\"разобраться на улице\\". Это просто верх непрофессионализма и хамства! Ушел оттуда с пустыми руками. 5. Планировал приобрести Форд Фокус, в АЦ Фрунзе были обещания приятной цены и выбора. Но как только я приехал, картина маслом - ни обещанной цены, ни даже модели в наличии! Предложили что-то совершенно другое, и ценник на миллион выше. Мои вопросы о первоначальном предложении встретили холодностью и безразличием. Хуже всего то, что мне еще и выписали штраф за отказ! Абсурд!

Since direct database operations like running an encoded query cannot be done purely from client-side due to ServiceNow's security model, you'll also need to utilize a Scripted REST API or a GlideAjax call to perform server-side logic. Here’s how you can approach this: # 1. Create a Scripted REST API or GlideAjax to Perform the Server-Side Logic If you’re unfamiliar with creating a Scripted REST API, ServiceNow’s documentation provides a comprehensive guide. Here is a rough example of what the server-side script could look like. This example assumes you're familiar with creating a Scripted REST API. **Scripted REST API Example:** (Remember to secure your REST API as needed) \`\`\`javascript (function process(/*RESTAPIRequest*/ request, /*RESTAPIResponse*/ response) { var ipAddress = request.queryParams.ip_address.toString(); // Assume we pass the IP address as a query parameter // Initialize the result object var result = { parents: [], }; // Query the second table with our conditions var gr = new GlideRecord('your_second_table_name'); gr.addQuery('type', 10); gr.addQuery('child.ip_address', ipAddress); gr.query(); while(gr.next()) { // Check for parent records with operational status = 1 var parentGr = new GlideRecord('parent_table_name'); // Correct this with your actual parent table parentGr.addQuery('sys_id', gr.getValue('parent')); parentGr.addQuery('operational_status', 1); parentGr.query(); while(parentGr.next()) { // Append parent names to the result object result.parents.push(parentGr.getValue('name')); } } return result; // This will be JSON format })(request, response); \`\`\` # 2. Catalog Client Script to Call This API and Display Results Now, on the client side, you can use a Catalog Client Script to respond to changes on your \`select_server\` variable, call the API, and display the popup if applicable. Here’s a basic approach using a \`Catalog Client Script\`: **Type:** onChange **Target Field:** select_server (adjust if your variable name is different) \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Replace \`your_rest_api_endpoint\` with the endpoint of your Scripted REST API, and correct the path as necessary var url = '/api/your_namespace/your_rest_api_endpoint?ip_address=' + newValue; // Make a server call var request = new XMLHttpRequest(); request.open('GET', url, true); request.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); request.setRequestHeader('Accept','application/json'); request.onreadystatechange = function() { if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) { var response = JSON.parse(this.responseText); if (response.parents.length > 0) { // Show a popup with parent names alert('Found Parents with Operational Status = 1: ' + response.parents.join(', ')); // Clear the select_server variable g_form.clearValue('select_server'); } } }; request.send(); } \`\`\` **Note:** For the client script to work with external REST APIs, ensure CORS is properly configured in ServiceNow to allow the request. This example should give you a starting point. However, please adapt the scripts based on your exact table names, REST API paths, and other specific requirements. Also, remember to test thoroughly in a sub-production instance before moving your changes to production."},{"prompt":"I have one variable in my catalog item named as select_server and refer to the cmdb_ci_server table. my requirement is that if i select any record on the variable it will get the ip_address field value and then compare with the cmdb_rel_ci table with encoded query condition “type = 10^child.ip_address =”. then check all records operational status shown in parent column in list view. after querying all records if suppose 2 records found with the operational status ==1 out of ALL records then show a popup on catalog item with the names of both records and clear the variable of select_server. in servicenow","completion":"To fulfill your requirement in ServiceNow, which involves fetching and comparing records from two related tables (\`cmdb_ci_server\` and \`cmdb_rel_ci\`), showing a popup based on certain conditions, and clearing a variable (\`select_server\`), you should employ a mix of client-side JavaScript for the Service Catalog and server-side script for the data querying. This typically involves a GlideAjax call to a Script Include. Below, I detail how to set this up step-by-step: # Step 1: Create a Script Include First, create a Script Include that will be responsible for performing the server-side data fetch and logic. Script Include Example: \`\`\`javascript var CheckOperationalStatus = Class.create(); CheckOperationalStatus.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getOperationalStatus: function() { var ip_address = this.getParameter('sysparm_ip_address'); var result = []; // Find relationships in cmdb_rel_ci based on the provided IP address var relGR = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); relGR.addQuery('type', 10); relGR.addQuery('child.ip_address', ip_address); relGR.query(); while (relGR.next()) { // Fetch parent records var parentGR = new GlideRecord('cmdb_ci'); if (parentGR.get(relGR.parent.sys_id.toString())) { if (parentGR.operational_status == '1') { // Assuming '1' signifies the operational status you're interested in // Push the name of the operational item result.push(parentGR.name.toString()); } } } // Returning JSON string because it's easier to handle in client script return JSON.stringify(result); }, type: 'CheckOperationalStatus' }); \`\`\` This Script Include, upon being called with an IP address, returns a JSON string of names where the operational status is as desired. # Step 2: Create a Catalog Client Script This Client Script will trigger whenever the \`select_server\` variable changes, calling the Script Include created earlier and handling the response. Catalog Client Script Example: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } // Clear the variable first to handle quick multiple selections g_form.clearValue('select_server'); // Fetch the selected server's IP address var ip_address = g_form.getReference('select_server', function(ref) { // Now pass this to the server side var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_ip_address', ref.ip_address); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ var result = JSON.parse(answer); if (result.length > 0) { // If operational statuses were found, show them var names = result.join(', '); alert(\\"Operational Items: \\" + names); // Note: Clearing the select_server variable again might not be necessary here as it was cleared at the start. } }); }); } \`\`\` This Client Script executes when the \`select_server\` variable changes and uses GlideAjax to communicate with the Script Include, fetching details based on the selected server's IP address. It then checks the response. If there are records found matching the conditions, it displays a popup with their names and clears the \`select_server\` variable. # Final Notes: - Ensure your \`cmdb_ci_server\` table does have an IP address field (\`ip_address\` in this context), or adjust to use the correct field. - Adapt field naming based on your instance's configuration, as there might be slight variations or customizations in your setup. - Test thoroughly on a sub-production instance before considering production deployment."},{"prompt":"I have one variable in my catalog item named as select_server and refer to the cmdb_ci_server table. my requirement is that if i select any record on the variable it will get the ip_address field value and then compare with the cmdb_rel_ci table with encoded query condition “type = 10^child.ip_address =”. then check all records operational status shown in parent column in list view. after querying all records if suppose 2 records found with the operational status ==1 out of ALL records then show a popup on catalog item with the names of both records and clear the variable of select_server. in servicenow workflow i wrote this script . get reference here also to understand var relGlide = new GlideRecord(\\"cmdb_rel_ci); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb0a0a0b78006081a72ef08444^child.ip_address=\\" +current.variables.ip_address; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()){ //if any CI is operational if(relGlide.parent.operational_status ==1){ } }","completion":"To achieve the described requirements, you will need to build a client-side script that triggers when the 'select_server' variable changes. This script should call a server-side Script Include using GlideAjax to perform the heavy lifting of querying and logic based on the \`cmdb_rel_ci\` table and the \`cmdb_ci\` table for the operational status. The following outlines how to set this up in a ServiceNow instance. # Step 1: Create a Script Include First, create a Script Include that will handle the server-side logic. Ensure that this script is accessible by the client by setting the \`Accessible from\` property to \`All application scopes\`. \`\`\`javascript var ValidateOperationalStatus = Class.create(); ValidateOperationalStatus.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkOperationalStatus: function(ip_address) { var operationalNames = []; var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); // Constructing the encoded query string var queryString = \\"type=10^child.ip_address=\\" + ip_address; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { var parent = relGlide.parent.getRefRecord(); // Check if the parent's operational status is '1' (Operational) if (parent && parent.operational_status == '1') { operationalNames.push(parent.name.toString()); // Collects names of all operational parents } } return operationalNames; // Return the collected names }, ajaxFunction_getParentNames: function() { var ip_address = this.getParameter('sysparm_ip_address'); // Retrieve passed IP address parameter var result = this.checkOperationalStatus(ip_address); return JSON.stringify(result); // Send results back to client-side as a JSON string }, type: 'ValidateOperationalStatus' }); \`\`\` # Step 2: Create an OnChange Catalog Client Script This client script will trigger when the \`select_server\` variable is changed on your catalog item. It will use \`GlideAjax\` to asynchronously call the Script Include and process the response. \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } g_form.getReference('select_server', function(ref) { var ip_address = ref.ip_address; // Assuming the selected server record has an 'ip_address' field var ga = new GlideAjax('ValidateOperationalStatus'); // The name of your Script Include ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getParentNames'); // The function in the Script Include to call ga.addParam('sysparm_ip_address', ip_address); // Pass the IP address to the Script Include ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ var operationalNames = JSON.parse(answer); if (operationalNames.length > 0) { // If two or more records found with operational status = 1 alert(\\"Operational CIs: \\" + operationalNames.join(', ')); g_form.clearValue('select_server'); // Clear the 'select_server' variable } }); }); } \`\`\` **Key Points:** - This solution assumes that the \`cmdb_rel_ci\` relation type that you mentioned as \\"type = 10\\" is correctly identified and that \\"type=10\\" is indeed the correct encoded query parameter for this scope. Adjust the encoded query as needed for your specific configuration. - The field and table names used (e.g., \`operational_status\`, \`cmdb_rel_ci\`, \`cmdb_ci_server\`) are assumed based on typical ServiceNow schema. **Please verify and replace these with your actual field and table names if they differ.** - Testing: Thoroughly test this solution in a non-production environment before applying it to your production instance to ensure it behaves as expected. This should fulfill your requirement to check operational status based on selected server's IP and provide feedback via a popup while clearing the selected server variable if the conditions are met."},{"prompt":"Améliore ce message. \\"Vous voulez un peu d'énergie ce matin ? eh bien en voilà avec It's Only A Dream - Mama Lion\\"","completion":"\\"À la recherche d'un coup de boost énergique ce matin ?

En français, le verbe \\"avouer\\" peut fonctionner sans objet direct dans ce contexte, on n'a donc pas besoin d'ajouter un pronom comme \\"le\\" pour que la phrase soit complète. Le français fonctionne avec une certaine souplesse permettant l'omission de l'objet direct quand celui-ci est sous-entendu ou implicite.

Отзывы должны быть совершенно разные! Выражай эмоции, словно ты обиженный покупатель. Пиши от первого лица. Указывай разные модели автомобилей. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Поехала в автосалон на Новоясеневском проспекте, уж и не знаю, как он там по настоящему называется, там по этому адресу раньше был другой салон. Решила попытать счастья, уж очень они меня к себе зазывали, присмотрела новую Приору, а как первоначальный взнос внести свой старый автомобиль, предварительно мне его оценили в 120000 р. Как приехала, мою старую забрали на оценку. А меня отправили в выставочный зал, приставив юркого консультанта. Странно, но ассортимент очень скудный. Одни Лады. Странно не то, что Лады, конечно, а то, что на сайте невиданное количество разных и так еще уверенно уменьшенных в стоимости. Оценили мою в какие-то копейки, я даже ушам не поверила. Выбранную машину предложили оплатить почти целиком, тогда бы мне ее типа привезли. Нюанс, с учетом и так мизерно оцененного старого автомобиля и моего согласия на оформление машины в кредит ее стоимость была почти на 240000 р больше заявленной на сайте!!! И что, это они называют выгодной покупкой? Чушь. Не связывайтесь и даже не пытайтесь.","completion":"1. Прошлой неделей решился на покупку новенького Ford Focus в автосалоне Ац Фрунзе, о котором слышал много обещаний хороших сделок. Но всё пошло наперекосяк с самого начала. Мне казалось, что встречают меня радушно, но как только я начал задавать вопросы о цене и условиях, обслуживание превратилось в кошмар. Мне предложили за мою старую машину цену, которая была настолько смешно низкой, что я подумал, они шутят. А когда дело дошло до обсуждения цены нового автомобиля, сумма оказалась значительно выше, чем обещали изначально. Осадок остался неприятный, не советую никому обращаться в этот салон! 2. В поисках нового автомобиля на замену старому, выбор пал на Nissan Qashqai и, к сожалению, на автосалон Ац Фрунзе. Заинтригованный скидками и специальными предложениями, я оказался в ловушке их маркетинга. При оценке моего старого автомобиля они предложили цену, от которой хотелось плакать. А когда они озвучили итоговую стоимость нового авто с учётом обмена и всех \\"скидок\\", то стало понятно, что это обман: цена выросла в разы по сравнению с заявленной на сайте. Чувствую себя крайне обманутым и разочарованным. Печальный опыт, который я не желаю никому. 3. Я был настолько взволнован, когда приехал в салон Ац Фрунзе за новой Toyota Camry! Но моё волнение быстро сменилось горечью разочарования. Прежде всего, оценку моей старой машины произвели настолько низко, что я ощутил себя обманутым. Затем, когда дело дошло до новой машины, цена на неё внезапно \\"выросла\\" из-за различных \\"необходимых\\" услуг и наценок. В итоге, по ощущениям, я переплачиваю колоссальную сумму. Оставил их салон с чувством обиды и решительно не рекомендую вести здесь дела. 4. Приехал в салон Ац Фрунзе за мечтой - новеньким Mercedes Benz E-Class. Вместо мечты получил ночной кошмар. Начнём с того, что за мой старый автомобиль предложили такую цену, будто он ещё на ходу не держится. Когда говорили о цене новой машины, всё звучало замечательно, до тех пор не добрались до деталей. Вдруг всякие дополнительные услуги, страховки и налоги с непонятно откуда взявшимися сборами увеличили стоимость почти на 30%. Просто ощущаешь себя героем анекдота. Разъярён и разочарован, категорически не советую этот автосалон. 5. Хуже опыта покупки я даже представить себе не мог. VW Polo должен был стать моим первым автомобилем, купленным в салоне Ац Фрунзе. От мечты к реальности - один шаг, который превратился в квест с непредсказуемым исходом. Для начала оценили мой велосипед (старый автомобиль) в подарок дочке, а не как взнос на покупку. Дальше больше, обещанная цена на новый автомобиль внезапно \\"увеличилась\\" на невообразимые проценты после \\"вполне стандартных\\" процедур. Шокирован и обижен до глубины души. Пусть мой отзыв будет предостерегающим знаком для всех, кто ещё собрался туда за покупкой."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

**数据量**：对于大规模数据集，Transform模型能够更好地捕捉复杂的模式和依赖关系，是更佳选择。而对于较小的数据集，LSTM可能更为合适。 - **应用需求**：如果任务涉及到需要捕捉长距离依赖的复杂序列处理，Transform模型更有优势。而对于一些序列预测任务，如时间序列分析，LSTM模型可能更为有效。 - **计算资源**：Transform模型通常需要更多的计算资源和训练时间，因此对计算资源有限的情况，可能需要考虑LSTM或其他轻量级模型。 综上所述，虽然Transform模型在众多方面相较于LSTM有显著优势，但根据具体任务的需求、数据量以及可用的计算资源等因素，选择最合适的模型仍然是必要的。"},{"prompt":"global 局域网有哪些产品 如何构建","completion":"构建一个全局局域网(Global LAN)主要是为了确保在多个地理位置分散的办公室或设施内的计算机和设备能够安全、高效地共享资源和数据。全局局域网的设计与实施涉及多个层面，包括网络设备的选择、网络架构设计、安全策略的制定和实施等。这样的网络通常需要集成VPN（虚拟私人网络）、SD-WAN（软件定义广域网）、防火墙、交换机、路由器等多种技术和设备。 # 全局局域网产品 1. **VPN设备和软件**：VPN是构建全局局域网的核心技术之一，它能够确保远程位置的网络流量安全地经过公共网络。市场上有多家提供企业级VPN解决方案的厂商，如Cisco、Juniper Networks、Fortinet以及软件方案如OpenVPN等。 2. **SD-WAN解决方案**：SD-WAN提供了一种智能化的网络流量管理方式，能够基于当前网络条件优化数据传输路径，提供更好的连接质量和稳定性。市场上的主要提供商包括Cisco Viptela、VMware VeloCloud、Silver Peak等。 3. **网络安全产品**：构建全局局域网时，网络安全是须重点考虑的因素。这包括防火墙、入侵检测和预防系统、端点保护解决方案等。知名供应商有Palo Alto Networks、Check Point、Symantec等。 4. **网络交换机和路由器**：高性能的交换机和路由器是局域网的基础设施，用于数据包的转发和路由选择。一些著名的网络设备供应商，如Cisco、Juniper Networks、Huawei等，提供了多种适合不同规模应用的产品。 # 构建步骤 1. **需求评估**：首先评估组织的网络需求，包括带宽、连接的地理位置、应用场景等。 2. **网络设计**：根据需求设计全局局域网架构，选择合适的网络技术（如VPN、SD-WAN等）和设备。 3. **安全策略**：制定全面的网络安全策略，包括对外连接的安全、内部访问控制、数据加密等方面。 4. **实施和部署**：购买和配置必要的网络设备和软件，实施网络设计和安全策略。 5. **测试和优化**：在实际部署之后，进行全面的网络测试，确保网络的性能和稳定性符合预期。根据测试结果对网络进行调整和优化。 6. **维护和监控**：持续监控网络的性能和安全状况，定期更新设备和软件以修复安全漏洞和提升性能。 构建全局局域网是一个复杂的过程，需要综合考虑网络设计、设备选择、安全策略和成本等多个因素。因此，通常推荐与经验丰富的网络解决方案提供商合作，以确保网络的性能和安全性满足组织的需求。"},{"prompt":"你认为 大模型 如何更好的满足人类需求","completion":"大模型（例如大型AI语言模型如GPT-3、BERT、或Image生成模型如DALL-E）在近年来取得了显著的进展，它们已经在多个领域展示出了强大的能力，包括但不限于自然语言处理、图像识别、药物发现等。然而，要让这些大模型更好地满足人类需求，以下几个方向是关键： # 1. 增强可解释性和透明度 AI的决策过程往往被视为“黑箱”，这对于需要准确理解AI决策依据的场景（如医疗诊断、法律判决等）构成了挑战。提高模型的可解释性能够帮助用户更好地理解模型的决策依据，增加对AI的信任。 # 2. 强化伦理和公平性 AI模型倾向于从其训练数据中复制和放大偏见。设计和实施具有系统性方法以识别和减少偏倚，提高模型的公平性和伦理性，对于确保AI技术公正地服务于所有人群至关重要。 # 3. 保障隐私安全 大模型通过分析庞大的数据集进行训练，这引发了对数据隐私的担忧。使用隐私保护技术，如差分隐私、联邦学习等，可以在不泄露个人信息的前提下使用数据，增强用户对AI系统的信任。 # 4. 提高可访问性和普及性 将AI技术的强大能力普及到广大的用户和小型企业，需要简化AI模型的使用和部署。云服务提供商如Google Cloud, AWS, Azure等通过提供预训练模型和易用的API，降低了技术门槛。 # 5. 绿色AI 大模型的训练和部署消耗巨大的计算资源，对环境产生影响。研究和采用更高效的算法、减少模型大小而不牺牲性能，或者通过优化硬件和使用可再生能源来减少碳足迹，是未来发展的一大趋势。 # 6. 自定义和适应性 让AI模型能够根据特定用户、企业或行业的需求进行定制，让其输出更加相关和实用。这可能需要更强大的迁移学习能力和模型调整技术。 # 7. 多模态理解和生成 大多数现有的大模型依然局限于单一模态，比如纯文本或纯图像。发展能同时理解和生成跨文本、图像、视频、音频等多种数据类型的模型，可以在很大程度上丰富用户交互，提升AI的应用场景。 # 结论 满足人类需求的不仅是技术本身，还包括如何使技术更加合乎伦理、公平、可解释和环境友好。随着AI技术的不断发展，关注这些方面并采取行动，将使得大模型能够更好、更安全、更负责任地服务于人类社会。"},{"prompt":"我有一个文本生成的大模型，应当如何发展多模态理解和生成","completion":"将一个专注于文本生成的大型模型（比如GPT-3）扩展到多模态理解和生成，意味着使其能够处理并生成不仅仅是文本，还包括图像、音频、视频等多种数据类型。多模态模型能够更全面地理解世界，因为很多信息是跨模态的，而不是仅仅存在于单一模式中。以下是一些实现多模态理解和生成能力的步骤和方法： # 1. **数据准备** 在多模态模型中，需要配置涵盖各种模态的数据集，这些数据集应包含成对的或关联的文本和非文本信息（比如图像描述、视频字幕等）。这种跨模态的数据是训练多模态模型的基础。 # 2. **多模态预训练** 多模态预训练涉及在大规模的多模态数据集上训练模型，以学习跨不同模态之间的关联和表示。这可以是自监督的，比如通过遮掩某模式的部分信息让模型预测，或者是监督学习，比如使用有标签的多模态数据（图像及其描述）进行训练。 # 3. **模型架构选择** 多模态模型的设计可以采用多种架构。一种方法是使用单一的神经网络来处理所有模式的数据，这要求模型能够内部处理不同数据类型的差异。另一种方法是为每种模态设计专用子网络（比如CNN用于图像，RNN或Transformer用于文本），然后通过一个融合机制将它们的表示结合起来。 # 4. **交叉模态方法** 开发能够理解和生成跨模态内容的技术，如图像标注（生成描述图片的文本）、视觉问答（对图片内容提出和回答问题）、文本到图像生成（根据文本描述生成图像）等。这些方法需要模型能够将文本和其他模态的信息相互转换。 # 5. **优化任务和目标函数** 根据特定的应用场景，设计和优化模型的目标函数，如通过增强生成内容的相关性、创造性或准确度等方面来调整。多任务学习也是一个值得考虑的策略，通过在多个相关的跨模态任务上训练，提高模型的泛化能力。 # 6. **测试与评估** 设计多模态任务的性能评估标准，如使用专门针对图像标注的评估指标（例如BLEU、ROUGE或CIDEr）和针对文本到图像任务的人工评估指标等。进行全面的测试，以评估模型在不同模态、不同任务上的性能。 # 7. **持续迭代和改进** 基于测试反馈，不断迭代模型设计、数据处理和训练策略，优化模型性能。 多模态理解和生成是AI领域的前沿方向，它打破了模态间的界限，有助于构建更智能、更直观的人机交互系统。随着技术的不断进步，我们期待在这一领域见证更多创新和应用。"},{"prompt":"模型上下文长度和哪个模型结构中的哪个超参数有关，上下文长度决定了什么","completion":"模型的上下文长度主要与Transformer模型结构中的位置编码和自注意力（Self-Attention）机制有关。在Transformer及其衍生模型（如BERT、GPT系列等）中，上下文长度是由模型能够处理的最大输入序列长度所决定的，这通常通过一个超参数来设置，即输入序列的最大长度参数（比如在GPT中称为\`n_ctx\`）。这个参数直接影响到位置编码的维度，以及自注意力机制能够考虑的输入序列元素的范围。 # 上下文长度决定了什么？ 1. **理解能力**：上下文长度直接决定了模型能够“理解”或“记住”的输入信息的量，即模型在做出预测或生成文本时，能够利用多少历史信息。较长的上下文长度意味着模型可以考虑更多的前文信息，这在处理长文本、理解复杂句子结构或进行长范围依赖性分析时尤为重要。 2. **适用性**：上下文长度的设定影响了模型在特定应用场景中的适用性。例如，对于需要理解长文档或维持长篇对话的应用，较长的上下文长度是必要的；而对于简短文本分类或标签预测任务，较短的上下文长度可能就足够了。 3. **计算资源**：上下文长度的增加会显著提高计算资源的需求。自注意力机制的计算复杂度是序列长度的平方（O(n^2)），因此，输入长度的增加会导致模型训练和推理所需时间和内存成倍增加。这限制了在有限计算资源下，模型可处理的最大序列长度。 4. **训练与推理效率**：与计算资源需求相关，较长的上下文长度可能会减慢模型的训练和推理速度，尤其在大规模数据集上训练时。因此，在设计模型和选择超参数时，需要平衡上下文长度和计算效率。 # 如何管理上下文长度的挑战？ - **稀疏化的自注意力**：为了管理计算复杂度，可以采用稀疏化的自注意力机制，例如只在序列中的一部分位置上计算注意力权重，或者使用局部注意力模型。 - **有效的序列分割**：对于超出模型最大上下文长度的序列，可以采用分割策略将输入序列分割成较短的片段，并适当处理边界上下文，以尽可能保留信息。 - **模型和算法优化**：通过技术创新和算法优化，如使用深度可分离卷积、循环层来减少模型对长序列处理的计算资源需求。 上下文长度是影响Transformer及其衍生模型性能的关键超参数之一，合理设置和优化上下文长度对于提高模型的性能、适用性和计算效率都至关重要。"},{"prompt":"给定模型结构：Transformer( (tok_embeddings): Embedding(32000, 4096) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (layers): ModuleList( (0-31): 32 x TransformerBlock( (attention): Attention( (wq): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wk): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wv): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wo): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (attn_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (resid_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (feed_forward): FeedForward( (w1): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (w2): Linear(in_features=11008, out_features=4096, bias=False) (w3): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (attention_norm): RMSNorm() (ffn_norm): RMSNorm() ) ) (norm): RMSNorm() (output): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=32000, bias=False) )计算他的上下文长度，给出计算过程","completion":"实际上，上下文长度（即模型能够处理的最大输入序列长度）在Transformer模型结构描述中并没有直接给出。上下文长度并不由模型的内部参数直接决定，而是由模型设计时设置的输入长度限制所决定。 从给出的模型结构中，我们可以看到多个层次的信息，例如词嵌入的维度、自注意力机制的细节、前馈网络的配置，但这些参数告诉我们的是模型如何处理输入数据，而不是它可以处理多长的输入。 在实际的Transformer模型实现中，上下文长度主要由以下因素限制： 1. **模型的输入嵌入层**：尽管嵌入层可以映射任意长度的序列到一个固定的维度空间上（在这个例子中是\`32000\`个可能的输入映射到\`4096\`维空间），但是由于内存和计算力的限制，我们通常会设定一个最大序列长度。这个长度限制了模型一次能够处理的最大输入长度。 2. **可用内存和计算资源**：Transformer模型（尤其是大型模型）训练和推断的内存需求随着输入长度的增加而指数级增长，因为自注意力机制需要计算输入序列中所有元素对的相互关系。因此，可用的硬件资源实际上是一个重要的限制因素。 3. **模型设计**：一些Transformer模型的变种，比如Sparse Transformer，通过改变注意力机制的结构来允许更长的序列处理，但这些特定的设计决策需要在模型的架构中明确指出。 因此，要确定上下文长度，我们需要知道模型设计和实现时设定的最大序列长度参数，这通常在模型训练脚本或配置文件中明确指定，而不是从模型架构的层描述中直接获得。 在给定描述中未提及如何设置或限制输入序列的长度，因此无法直接从提供的信息中计算出上下文长度。确定实际的上下文长度需要查看更多关于模型训练和部署时的详细信息或文档。"},{"prompt":"最大上下文长度 和模型的输出有关吗， 比如最大上下文长度训练时给定的为4096，我输入了2048个字节，输出最多还能输出2048？","completion":"最大上下文长度与模型的输出长度并不直接相关，尤其是在讨论Transformer模型如GPT系列等用于生成任务时。解释这一点需要区分几个概念： 1. **最大上下文长度**：这是模型设计时设定的，决定了模型一次能够处理的最大输入长度（即模型考虑的最大序列长度）。对于Transformer模型，这通常受到了模型的内存和计算能力等因素的限制。 2. **输入长度**：在进行具体的生成任务时，用户输入到模型的序列长度。这个长度可以小于或等于最大上下文长度。 3. **输出长度**：这是指模型在给定输入后生成的输出序列的长度。对于文本生成模型，输出长度通常由特定的生成策略决定（比如，通过指定生成的最大长度、使用停止标记等），并不直接由最大上下文长度决定。 如果模型的最大上下文长度为4096，而你的输入长度为2048，那么理论上模型仍然有能力生成长度为4096的输出（假设你没有指定更短的生成长度限制）。然而，实际输出长度会受到多个因素的影响： - **生成策略**：在生成文本时，可以通过指定最大生成长度、采用early stopping标准（如遇到特定的终止符）等策略影响输出长度。 - **模型能力和训练数据**：模型是否能有效生成长序列，还取决于其在训练过程中看到的数据分布以及其学习到的内在结构。 - **计算和内存限制**：在实际应用中，尽管理论上模型可能支持长达4096的输出，但生成过程中的计算和内存消耗也需要考虑。 总之，最大上下文长度定义了模型可以考虑的最大输入长度，但实际输出长度则由生成任务的具体设置和模型能力共同决定。在使用时，通常需要根据具体任务和资源限制合理设置输出长度。"},{"prompt":"如果我输入超出了最大输入长度会发生什么","completion":"如果输入长度超过了模型的最大上下文长度，即超出了模型设计时设定的输入长度限制，通常会发生以下几种情况： # 1. **截断**： 最常见的处理方式是截断。这意味着输入序列的一部分（通常是超过限制部分）会被舍弃，以确保输入长度不超过模型的最大上下文长度。截断可以发生在序列的开头（头部截断），尾部（尾部截断），或者根据某种启发式方法处理（比如保留包含关键信息的部分）。这种处理方式简单直接，但可能会导致重要信息丢失。 # 2. **分割序列**： 另一种处理方法是将超长输入分割成多个小于或等于最大上下文长度的子序列，并分别对它们进行处理。这样可以保留全部的输入信息，但需要一种机制来合理地结合各子序列处理的结果。分割序列可以用于不同的任务，如分类、回答生成等，但需要特别考虑如何处理跨序列的信息连贯性。 # 3. **模型或处理流程报错**： 在某些情况下，如果未实现适当的截断或分割策略，输入超出最大上下文长度可能导致模型或处理流程因无法处理该输入而报错。这通常发生在模型或系统未被适当配置以自动处理超长输入的情况下。 # 4. **性能下降**： 即使某些模型在技术上能够接受超长输入（例如，通过某种形式的动态序列处理能力），性能（包括准确率和/或生成质量）可能会因为模型未在处理如此长序列的任务上进行优化而下降。 # 如何处理超长输入？ - **预处理**：在数据输入模型之前，通过截断或分割序列的预处理步骤来避免超长输入。 - **模型修改**：对于特定的应用，可以考虑修改模型架构，以提高对长序列的处理能力，例如采用层次化注意力机制或改进的长序列处理算法。 - **批量处理**：对于分割的序列，可以使用批量处理来并行处理多段序列，以提高效率。 - **注意力窗口**：对于某些模型，可以采用局部注意力机制或滑动窗口方法来限制每次计算注意力时考虑的序列范围，从而允许处理理论上更长的序列。 处理超长输入时应根据具体任务的需求和模型的能力灵活选择最合适的策略。"},{"prompt":"给定模型结构：Transformer( (tok_embeddings): Embedding(32000, 4096) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (layers): ModuleList( (0-31): 32 x TransformerBlock( (attention): Attention( (wq): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wk): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wv): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wo): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (attn_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (resid_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (feed_forward): FeedForward( (w1): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (w2): Linear(in_features=11008, out_features=4096, bias=False) (w3): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (attention_norm): RMSNorm() (ffn_norm): RMSNorm() ) ) (norm): RMSNorm() (output): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=32000, bias=False) ) 帮我生成一份训练代码","completion":"要根据您给出的模型结构生成一个基本的训练循环，我们需要补充一些信息和假设。例如，我们将这个模型视为一个基于Transformer架构的文本生成任务模型（类似于GPT）。下面是一个简单化的PyTorch代码框架，用于模拟训练过程。请注意，实际生产代码会更加复杂，并且需要考虑数据预处理、验证、测试、保存和加载模型、调整超参数等方面。 \`\`\`python import torch from torch import nn from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset import torch.optim as optim # 假设的数据集类 class MyTextDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, texts, tokenizer, max_length): self.tokenizer = tokenizer self.max_length = max_length self.inputs = [self.tokenizer.encode(text, max_length=self.max_length, truncation=True) for text in texts] def __len__(self): return len(self.inputs) def __getitem__(self, idx): return torch.tensor(self.inputs[idx]) # 假设的模型构建（基于提供的描述） class MyTransformerModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(MyTransformerModel, self).__init__() self.tok_embeddings = nn.Embedding(32000, 4096) self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.0) self.layers = nn.ModuleList([TransformerBlock() for _ in range(32)]) self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(4096) self.output = nn.Linear(4096, 32000) def forward(self, x): x = self.tok_embeddings(x) x = self.dropout(x) for layer in self.layers: x = layer(x) x = self.norm(x) x = self.output(x) return x class TransformerBlock(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(TransformerBlock, self).__init__() self.attention = Attention() self.feed_forward = FeedForward() self.attention_norm = nn.LayerNorm(4096) self.ffn_norm = nn.LayerNorm(4096) def forward(self, x): attn_output = self.attention(x) x = self.attention_norm(x + attn_output) ffn_output = self.feed_forward(x) x = self.ffn_norm(x + ffn_output) return x class Attention(nn.Module): # 根据描述精简实现，省略具体自注意力实现细节 def __init__(self): super(Attention, self).__init__() self.wq = nn.Linear(4096, 4096, bias=False) self.wk = nn.Linear(4096, 4096, bias=False) self.wv = nn.Linear(4096, 4096, bias=False) self.wo = nn.Linear(4096, 4096, bias=False) self.attn_dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.0) self.resid_dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.0) def forward(self, x): # 省略自注意力机制的实现 return x class FeedForward(nn.Module): # 根据描述精简实现，具体激活函数等省略 def __init__(self): super(FeedForward, self).__init__() self.w1 = nn.Linear(4096, 11008, bias=False) self.w2 = nn.Linear(11008, 4096, bias=False) # w3 is not used in FeedForward so ignore it here self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.0) def forward(self, x): x = self.w1(x) x = self.dropout(x) x = self.w2(x) return x # 假设的训练循环 def train(model, data_loader, loss_fn, optimizer, device): model.train() for batch in data_loader: batch = batch.to(device) optimizer.zero_grad() output = model(batch) loss = loss_fn(output, batch) # 假设标签与输入相同（自回归生成） loss.backward() optimizer.step() print(f\\"Loss: {loss.item()}\\") # 模拟的初始化代码 def main(): device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') model = MyTransformerModel().to(device) sample_texts = [\\"This is a sample text.\\", \\"Here is another one.\\"] tokenizer = ... # 初始化合适的tokenizer dataset = MyTextDataset(sample_texts, tokenizer, max_length=256) data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True) loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001) train(model, data_loader, loss_fn, optimizer, device) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` 请注意，这是一个高度简化的例子。上述代码中省略了Attention和FeedForward类的细节实现，且简化了模型的使用场景。在实际应用中，需要根据特定任务对数据预处理、模型架构和训练循环进行详细设计和优化。此外，真正的Transformer实现需要包含完整的自注意力机制细节，以及可能的解码器部分（如果是Seq2Seq任务）。此代码旨在提供一个如何开始构建和训练基于Transformer的模型的基本框架。"},{"prompt":"MLP","completion":"多层感知机（MLP，Multilayer Perceptron）是一种前馈人工神经网络模型，它模拟了人类大脑的神经网络，以解决各种机器学习问题。MLP由多个层次组成，包括输入层、一个或多个隐藏层和输出层。每一层都由多个神经元组成，相邻层之间的每个神经元通过权重连接。MLP通过学习这些权重来解决分类、回归等问题。 # MLP的结构 1. **输入层**：接收输入数据。每个神经元代表输入数据的一个特征。 2. **隐藏层**：一个或多个隐藏层可以提取输入数据的特征。每个隐藏层包含一定数量的神经元，这些神经元通过非线性激活函数（如ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh等）处理数据。 3. **输出层**：输出层产生最终的预测结果。在分类问题中，输出层的神经元数量通常与类别数量相等。 # MLP的工作原理 -

在模型的输入阶段，模型会将位置编码与输入数据（例如，词嵌入）相结合。这意味着如果文档中直接提到了“位置编码”的应用或是展示了输入部分被明确修改以包含位置信息，那么可以断定使用了位置编码。 2. **作为预处理步骤**： - 如果文档或代码中提到了对输入数据进行了包含位置信息的预处理步骤，即使在模型结构描述中没有直接提到，也意味着使用了位置编码。 3. **通过模型的输入接口隐含**： - 某些模型框架可能会将位置编码的实现隐藏于更高层次的抽象接口之中。在这种情况下，除非文档详细说明或您查看更深层的实现代码，否则可能不容易直接从模型结构描述中看出是否使用了位置编码。 # 在Transformer模型中的位置编码 以Transformer为例，位置编码通常是模型架构的一个键入部分，以确保模型能够理解序列中词汇的顺序，因为Transformer的自注意力机制自身并不包含处理序列顺序的机制。位置编码通过与词嵌入（token embeddings）相加的方式加入到模型的输入中。如果一个模型结构描述中提到了类似“将位置信息以某种方式添加到输入嵌入中”的操作，那么可以肯定它使用了位置编码。 结论是，要从模型结构上直接确定是否使用了位置编码并不总是直观的，需要具体分析模型的输入处理方式、查看模型的详细文档描述，或直接检查实现代码。在处理诸如自然语言处理这样的序列化数据任务时，位置编码是Transformer及其衍生模型能够理解序列顺序的关键技术之一。"},{"prompt":"RoPE","completion":"RoPE（Rotary Position Embedding）是一种在自然语言处理（NLP）中用于捕获序列位置信息的技术。它代表了一种创新的位置编码方法，尤其在处理长序列时与传统的Transformer模型相比显示出了优势。RoPE的主要思想是通过旋转操作来编码序列中每个元素的位置信息，该方法有助于模型更好地捕获和利用序列中元素之间的相对位置关系。 # RoPE的核心概念 RoPE将位置信息通过一种旋转矩阵的方式引入到自注意力机制中。具体来说，它通过对序列中每个元素的嵌入向量进行旋转变换，从而将位置信息直接融入到嵌入表示中。这种旋转变换保持了元素之间位置差的信息，即使在序列非常长的情况下也能有效工作，从而在理论上能够处理无限长的序列。这与传统的位置编码方法不同，后者通常通过向嵌入向量中加入或拼接静态的或可学习的位置向量来实现位置信息的编码。 # RoPE的优势 1. **相对位置编码**：RoPE更自然地捕获了序列中元素之间的相对位置关系，这对于理解语序敏感的语言结构特别重要。 2. **可扩展性**：相较于传统的位置编码方法，RoPE提供了更好的可扩展性，使得模型能够有效处理更长的序列。 3. **效率和表现**：在某些任务中，使用RoPE的模型展示出了与或超过使用传统位置编码的Transformer模型相比的更好性能。 # 应用场景 RoPE的提出主要是为了改进Transformer架构中的位置编码机制，使之更适用于处理长序列数据。因此，它主要应用于自然语言处理领域，包括但不限于文本分类、语言模型、机器翻译、文本摘要生成等任务。 # 实践意义 RoPE的设计展示了自然语言处理技术在处理序列数据时不断进步的趋势。通过更有效的位置编码，模型能够更好地理解文本中词汇的顺序关系，从而提高对语言的理解和生成能力。RoPE等技术的发展为解决长序列处理带来了新的可能性，进一步推动了NLP领域的发展。 总的来说，RoPE提供了一种新颖的位置编码方法，通过旋转矩阵将位置信息融入到序列元素的表示中，有助于改善模型对长序列数据的处理能力和准确性。"},{"prompt":"RoPE如何实现的","completion":"Rotary Position Embedding（RoPE）是一种创新的位置编码方式，主要用于Transformer模型来提高其处理长序列任务的能力。RoPE的核心思想是利用旋转矩阵来对序列中每个元素的嵌入表示进行编码，从而将位置信息融入到元素的向量表示中。这种方法通过捕获元素之间的相对位置信息，有助于模型更有效地处理自然语言处理（NLP）任务。 # 实现原理 RoPE的实现基于一种思想：对嵌入向量进行旋转，使得旋转的角度依赖于元素在序列中的位置。具体来说，RoPE将每个位置编码为一个旋转矩阵，然后将这个旋转矩阵应用于每个词向量（或更普遍的是元素向量）。这种方式模拟了一种复数域上的旋转操作，可以形式化为： 假设我们有一个词向量 (z in mathbb{R}^d)，其中 (d) 是向量的维度。在RoPE中，(z) 会被看作是复数空间中的点（对于实际实现中的实数向量，我们可以将其两两分组来模拟复数），位置 (p) 的旋转矩阵 (R_p) 可以应用于 (z) 来编码位置信息。 旋转角度与位置 (p) 是成比例的，这确保了模型可以通过观察两个词向量之间的角度差异来推断它们在序列中的相对位置。对于一个特定的维度 (i)，旋转可以写成： [z'_i = z_i cdot e^{left(-itheta_pright)}] 其中，(z'_i) 是旋转后的向量，(theta_p) 是与位置 (p) 相关的旋转角度，(i) 是复数单位。 通过这种方式，RoPE直接在嵌入向量上编码了位置信息，并且通过维持序列内元素之间的相对位置关系，可以提高模型处理有顺序数据的能力。 # RoPE的优点 - **相对位置敏感**：RoPE自然地捕捉了序列中元素的相对位置信息，有利于处理语言中的长距离依赖问题。 - **可扩展性**：与传统的加性位置编码（如Transformer中的位置编码）不同，RoPE更适合处理长序列，理论上可以处理无限长的序列。 - **效率**：RoPE可以通过矩阵运算高效实施，易于集成到现有的Transformer模型中。 # 实践应用 RoPE的实现要求改动Transformer架构中的自注意力机制，以确保位置编码能通过旋转方式融入到自注意力计算中。虽然RoPE增加了模型处理位置信息的能力，但它也需要仔细的实现和调试才能在具体任务中达到预期效果。由于其相对较新，研究者和开发者可能需要进行额外的实验来充分利用RoPE的潜力。"},{"prompt":"该模型结构是否包含RoPE：Transformer( (tok_embeddings): Embedding(32000, 4096) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (layers): ModuleList( (0-31): 32 x TransformerBlock( (attention): Attention( (wq): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wk): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wv): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (wo): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=False) (attn_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) (resid_dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (feed_forward): FeedForward( (w1): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (w2): Linear(in_features=11008, out_features=4096, bias=False) (w3): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=11008, bias=False) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False) ) (attention_norm): RMSNorm() (ffn_norm): RMSNorm() ) ) (norm): RMSNorm() (output): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=32000, bias=False) )","completion":"基于您提供的模型结构，直接从结构描述中识别出是否包含Rotary Position Encoding（RoPE）并不直观。在传统的Transformer结构描述中，细节通常包括词嵌入（\`Embedding\`）、自注意力机制（\`Attention\`）、前馈网络（\`FeedForward\`）、以及可能的归一化层（如\`LayerNorm\`或\`RMSNorm\`）等组件。然而，RoPE作为一种特定的位置编码方案，其实现细节可能不会直接体现在最高级的模型结构描述中。 RoPE是通过对嵌入向量应用旋转操作来编码位置信息的，它通常与模型的输入（即词嵌入层之后）直接相关联，或内嵌于自注意力计算过程中。因此，除非模型结构描述明确提及了使用RoPE或者在自注意力部分包含了相关的操作细节，否则仅通过上述描述是难以确定该模型是否实际集成了RoPE。 要判断模型是否使用了RoPE，您可以查找几个可能的线索： 1. **源代码**：检查模型的实现代码，看是否有RoPE的具体实现，包括但不限于对序列中每个元素的嵌入进行特定的旋转变换。 2. **文档或注释**：开发者有时会在文档或代码注释中说明模型的细节，包括使用的特定技术和方法，如RoPE。 3. **相关论文或出版物**：如果此模型是基于某篇论文，论文中可能会详细描述使用的位置编码方案，包括是否采用了RoPE或其他类型的位置编码。 总结来说，仅从提供的模型结构描述中，我们不能直接断定它包含了RoPE。需要进一步的细节，特别是实现细节或相关文档，才能确定是否采用了RoPE作为位置编码方案。"},{"prompt":"FlashAttention 是什么","completion":"截至我的最后更新（2023年4月），FlashAttention 是一种新的注意力机制实现，旨在显著提高Transformer模型在硬件上的执行效率，特别是针对大模型和长序列数据。它主要通过优化自注意力（Self-Attention）计算过程来实现这一目标，这是Transformer模型中最核心也是计算密集度最高的部分。 Transformer模型在自然语言处理（NLP）、图像处理、语音识别等多个领域中取得了成功，但它们的计算成本随着模型大小和处理序列长度的增加而增加。尤其是在自注意力机制中，每个序列元素都需要与序列中的所有其他元素进行比较，导致其计算复杂度为O(n²)，其中n是序列的长度。这使得处理长序列或大规模部署（尤其在资源受限的设备上）变得具有挑战性。 # FlashAttention的核心贡献和特点： 1. **效率提升**：通过重新设计自注意力的计算过程，FlashAttention能够减少计算中的冗余和提高内存访问效率，从而加速自注意力机制的执行时间。这对于在GPU和其他并行计算硬件上运行Transformer模型尤为重要。 2. **优化内存使用**：一般而言，自注意力计算需要存储大量的中间结果，这对内存带宽和容量要求很高。FlashAttention通过其优化的算法降低了这些需求，使模型在相同硬件条件下能处理更长的序列或利用同样的资源运行更大的模型。 3. **适用性**：虽然FlashAttention专注于提升执行效率，但它设计得足够通用，可以直接应用于多种基于Transformer的架构和任务，无需对模型架构进行重大更改。 # 应用场景 由于FlashAttention主要优化计算效率和内存使用，它对于需要处理大规模数据集、长序列或在资源受限环境（例如移动设备上的实时应用）中运行深度学习模型的应用场景特别有价值。 # 结论 FlashAttention代表了针对Transformer模型自注意力机制的一种重要优化，它能够显著提高模型在硬件上的执行效率而不牺牲性能。这种类型的创新对于促进深度学习技术的广泛部署和应用至关重要，特别是在处理复杂任务和大规模数据集时。随着深度学习研究和实践的不断进展，类似FlashAttention这样的技术可以期待在未来得到更广泛的应用和进一步的发展。"},{"prompt":"please correct the executive summary: This report details the current status and progress of cutting, prefabrication and construction of unit block of Hull 428 during the period March 2024.

It suggests that you are attempting to access an attribute or method named \`get_r\` on an instance of a \`Circle\` class, but no such attribute or method exists in that class definition. This issue can happen for a variety of reasons: 1. **Typo in Method Name:** Double-check the \`Circle\` class definition. It's possible that the method you intend to call is named differently (e.g., \`get_radius\` instead of \`get_r\`). 2. **Method Not Defined:** The method \`get_r\` might not be defined in your \`Circle\` class. If you intended to use this method to get the radius of the circle, you need to define it within your class. 3. **Accessing Attribute Directly:** If your goal is to access the radius of the circle, and if the radius is stored in an attribute (say, \`radius\`), you might not need a \`get_r\` method at all. You could access the attribute directly if access control allows (e.g., \`my_circle.radius\`). 4. **Inheritance Issues:** If \`Circle\` is supposed to inherit from another class that defines \`get_r\`, make sure that the inheritance is set up correctly.

This transformation will redefine educational norms, alter roles within the learning environment, and culminate in the production of self-motivated, inquiry-driven scholars. Leveraging interdisciplinary insights, notably from educational psychology, organizational behavior, and change management, our approach emphasizes active learning, critical thinking, and collaboration. **Introduction:** The paradigm shift towards a student-as-scholar model represents a significant departure from conventional education models. However, it aligns perfectly with the evolving demands of the 21st-century workforce and society. A student-as-scholar approach promotes not just the acquisition of knowledge but the ability to critically evaluate, synthesize, and apply this knowledge creatively in diverse contexts. Our proposal outlines a strategy rooted in evidence-based practices to foster a culture where students are active participants in their learning journey. **Vision for Change:** Adopting a student-as-scholar model involves more than just changing teaching methods; it requires a cultural shift. This vision manifests through: 1. Empowering students to take charge of their education. 2. Encouraging exploration and research from day one. 3. Fostering a collaborative environment where knowledge is co-created. **Strategic Approach:** Our approach is categorized into four key dimensions: Structural Reforms, Pedagogical Innovations, Capacity Building, and Culture Shift. 1. **Structural Reforms:** - Implementing flexible curriculum designs that allow students to pursue individual interests within and beyond their majors. - Developing platforms for students to showcase their research and projects, fostering a community of inquiry and innovation. 2. **Pedagogical Innovations:** - Training faculty in facilitative teaching methods that promote critical discussion, problem-solving, and collaborative work. - Introducing problem-based learning (PBL) and inquiry-based learning (IBL) across all freshmen courses to initiate active learning from the onset. 3. **Capacity Building:** - Offering workshops and resources for students on research methodologies, academic writing, and critical analysis to bolster their skills as independent scholars. - Establishing mentorship programs pairing freshmen with upper-class students and faculty researchers in their field of interest. 4. **Culture Shift:** - Creating spaces and events that celebrate student research, innovation, and creative works to valorize scholarly activity. - Encouraging faculty and students to engage in joint research projects, blurring the traditional boundaries between teacher and learner. **Implementation Timeline:** 1. **Short-term (Year 1):** Initiate faculty development programs, introduce foundational PBL and IBL units in freshmen courses, and launch mentorship programs. 2. **Medium-term (Year 2-3):** Evaluate and adjust curriculum structures, expand the range of available workshops for capacity building, and establish platforms for showcasing student scholarship. 3. **Long-term (Year 4+):** Achieve full integration of the student-as-scholar model across the university, with ongoing review and enhancements. **Assessment and Evaluation Plan:** Our strategy includes a robust framework for continuous assessment, employing both qualitative and quantitative measures. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include student engagement metrics, faculty adoption rates of new pedagogical methods, and the quantity and quality of student-led research projects. Feedback loops involving students, faculty, and administrators will ensure the program's responsive evolution. **Conclusion:** The transition to a student-as-scholar culture requires intentional actions, commitment across the university community, and a willingness to embrace change. We believe Askenew University is poised to lead this transformation, setting a new standard for higher education. Our team is excited to partner with Askenew University on this journey, confident in the combined strength of our strategic approach and the university's vision for the future of education."},{"prompt":"write python code to extract data from google page","completion":"Here is an example Python code using the \`requests\` and \`beautifulsoup4\` libraries to extract data from a Google page: \`\`\`python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # URL of the Google page to extract data from url = \\"https://www.google.com\\" # Send a GET request to the URL response = requests.get(url) # Parse the HTML content of the page using BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \\"html.parser\\") # Find and extract the title of the page title = soup.title.text print(\\"Title:\\", title) # Find and extract all links on the page links = soup.find_all(\\"a\\") for link in links: print(\\"Link:\\", link.get(\\"href\\")) # Find and extract the text of the page text = soup.get_text() print(\\"Text:\\", text) \`\`\` This code sends a GET request to Google's homepage, parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extracts the title, links, and text of the page.

We'll assume a validator holds a certain amount of native tokens (NT) and calculate appreciation as NT * (End Token Price (ETP) - Start Token Price (STP)). 3. **Costs (C)**: Including Validators entry fee (VEF) and other operational costs (OC). **Profit Formula**: [ Profit = RT + RTPA - C ] [ RT = TC times TP ] [ RTPA = NT times (ETP - STP) ] [ C = VEF + OC ] **Putting it all together**: [ Profit = (TC times TP) + [NT times (ETP - STP)] - (VEF + OC) ] **Notes**: - This formula simplifies a lot of complexities surrounding blockchain economic models, such as varying transaction fees, the impact of active wallets on network participation and token value (which could be significant especially in networks that reward based on participation), and operational costs which can vary widely. - The revenue from Token Price Appreciation (RTPA) is speculative and may not necessarily result directly from activities as a validator but is included as holding the native token is often a requirement/expectation and its value appreciation can be a significant part of a validator’s return on investment. - The active wallets and validators count are critical for understanding the ecosystem's health and potential growth but are not directly factored into this profit formula. A larger number of active wallets might correlate with higher transaction counts (and thus higher RT) and a greater number of validators could affect the validator's potential rewards (especially if the rewards are distributed amongst all validators) and could thus adjust the formula based on more complex economic models of the blockchain in question. For a more precise and nuanced calculation, one would need to delve deeper into the specific economic model of the blockchain, incorporating more direct metrics on reward distribution mechanisms, variable operational costs, and potentially even integrating sentiment or growth indices to forecast changes in active participation and token value."},{"prompt":"please create a more complex formula that counts complexities surrounding blockchain economic models","completion":"Creating a complex formula to account for the intricacies of blockchain economic models requires considering several additional factors such as varying transaction fees, staking rewards, network effects, and the potential for change in validator requirements over time. This attempt will include more variables, but keep in mind, due to the complexity and variance between different blockchain protocols, this formula still simplifies real-world conditions and would need adjustments for specific blockchain analytics. # Expanded Formula Components 1. **Revenue from Transactions (RT)**: Sum of all transaction fees (variable based on transaction size, network congestion, etc.) over a period. This could potentially be weighted by the type of transaction if different fees apply. 2. **Revenue from Staking or Inflation Rewards (RS)**: Depending on the protocol, validators may receive rewards not directly linked to transaction fees but through network-designed inflationary mechanisms or staking. This includes new tokens being minted. 3. **Revenue from Participatory Activities (RPA)**: Some blockchains reward validators for additional activities like governance participation, proposing or voting on upgrades. 4. **Costs (C)**: We break this down into operational costs (OC), entry fees (if applicable every period and not just a one-time cost at the start), and potential penalties (P) for downtime or misbehavior. 5. **Market Dynamics (MD)**: Calculating the value change in native token holdings due to market price fluctuations. As before, we consider the number of native tokens held (NT) and the price change. Additionally, we incorporate a factor for active wallets (AW) and validator competition (VC) as indirect indicators of network health and growth, which could impact token value. # Complex Profit Formula **Given**: - ( TCF_t ) = Transaction count fees at time ( t ) (a vector of transaction fees). - ( SRT_t ) = Staking or inflation rewards at time ( t ). - ( RPA_t ) = Revenue from participatory activities at time ( t ). - ( OC_t ) = Operational costs at time ( t ). - ( VEF ) = Validator entry fee (if periodically applicable). - ( P_t ) = Penalties at time ( t ). - ( NT ) = Number of tokens held. - ( P_{start} ) and ( P_{end} ) = Price of the native token at the start and end of the period. - ( AW ) and ( VC ) = Active wallets and validator count, affecting network health and competition, possibly through a function ( f(AW, VC) ) that predicts market dynamics. [ RT_t = sum TCF_t ] [ RS_t = sum SRT_t ] [ RPA_t = text{(as predefined)} ] [ C_t = OC_t + VEF + P_t ] **For Market Dynamics (assuming a linear model for simplicity but could be more complex)**: [ MD = NT cdot (P_{end} - P_{start}) cdot f(AW, VC) ] **Total Profit** over the period ( t ) becomes: [ Profit_t = (RT_t + RS_t + RPA_t + MD) - C_t ] # Note: - This formula assumes linear relationships for simplicity, but real-world applications could involve nonlinear dynamics, especially in ( f(AW, VC) ) where network health impacts native token price in a non-linear, complex manner. - ( f(AW, VC) ) is a placeholder for a potentially complex model that would include sentiment analysis, network effect modeling, and competition dynamics among validators, requiring sophisticated statistical or machine learning models. - The actual calculation of market dynamics (MD) would likely need historical data analysis to establish a model for ( f(AW, VC) ) accurately. - The real-world applicability of this formula depends on the ability to accurately quantify and forecast each component, which in the case of blockchain, can be highly volatile and influenced by external factors beyond the scope of purely economic models. This expanded framework attempts to more closely approximate the complexities and dynamics of blockchain economics for validators, yet each blockchain network might require tailored modifications to accurately capture all profit influences."},{"prompt":"nice, please translate this to Russian language","completion":"Создание сложной формулы для учета особенностей экономических моделей блокчейна требует учета нескольких дополнительных факторов, таких как изменяющиеся комиссии за транзакции, вознаграждения за стейкинг, сетевые эффекты и потенциал изменений требований к валидаторам со временем. Эта попытка включит больше переменных, но имейте в виду, из-за сложности и различий между разными протоколами блокчейна, данная формула все еще упрощает реальные условия и потребует корректировок для конкретного анализа блокчейна. # Расширенные Компоненты Формулы 1. **Доход от Транзакций (RT)**: Сумма всех комиссий за транзакции (переменная в зависимости от размера транзакции, загруженности сети и т.д.) за период. Это может быть взвешено по типу транзакции, если применяются разные тарифы. 2. **Доход от Стейкинга или Инфляционных Вознаграждений (RS)**: В зависимости от протокола, валидаторы могут получать вознаграждения не напрямую связанные с комиссиями за транзакции, но через механизмы сетевой инфляции или стейкинга. Это включает новые токены, создаваемые в процессе. 3. **Доход от Участия в Активностях (RPA)**: Некоторые блокчейны вознаграждают валидаторов за дополнительные действия, такие как участие в управлении, предложение или голосование по обновлениям. 4. **Затраты (C)**: Мы разбиваем это на операционные расходы (OC), вступительные взносы (если они периодически применимы, а не только одноразово в начале) и потенциальные штрафы (P) за простой или неправильное поведение. 5. **Динамика Рынка (MD)**: Расчет изменения стоимости доли нативных токенов из-за колебаний рыночной цены. Как и ранее, мы учитываем количество держимых нативных токенов (NT) и изменение цены. Кроме того, мы включаем фактор активных кошельков (AW) и конкуренции валидаторов (VC) как косвенные индикаторы здоровья сети и роста, которые могут влиять на стоимость токена. # Сложная Формула Прибыли **Дано**: - ( TCF_t ) = Комиссии за транзакции в момент времени ( t ) (вектор комиссий за транзакции). - ( SRT_t ) = Вознаграждения за стейкинг или инфляцию в момент времени ( t ). - ( RPA_t ) = Доход от участия в активностях в момент времени ( t ). - ( OC_t ) = Операционные расходы в момент времени ( t ). - ( VEF ) = Вступительный взнос валидатора (если периодически применим). - ( P_t ) = Штрафы в момент времени ( t ). - ( NT ) = Количество держимых токенов. - ( P_{start} ) и ( P_{end} ) = Цена нативного токена в начале и конце периода. - ( AW ) и ( VC ) = Активные кошельки и количество валидаторов, влияющие на здоровье сети и конкуренцию, возможно, через функцию ( f(AW, VC) ), которая предсказывает динамику рынка. [ RT_t = sum TCF_t ] [ RS_t = sum SRT_t ] [ RPA_t = text{(как предопределено)} ] [ C_t = OC_t + VEF + P_t ] **Для Динамики Рынка (предполагая линейную модель для упрощения, но это может быть сложнее)**: [ MD = NT cdot (P_{end} - P_{start}) cdot f(AW, VC) ] **Общая Прибыль** за период ( t ) становится: [ Profit_t = (RT_t + RS_t + RPA_t + MD) - C_t ] # Примечание: - Эта формула предполагает линейные отношения для упрощения, но реальные приложения могут включать нелинейную динамику, особенно в ( f(AW, VC) ), где влияние здоровья сети на цену нативного токена носит нелинейный, сложный характер. - ( f(AW, VC) ) - это место для потенциально сложной модели, которая включала бы анализ настроений, моделирование сетевого эффекта и динамику конкуренции среди валидаторов, требуя сложных статистических или машинных обучающих моделей. - Фактический расчет динамики рынка (MD) вероятно потребует анализа исторических данных, чтобы точно установить модель для ( f(AW, VC) ). - Реальная применимость этой формулы зависит от способности точно количественно оценить и прогнозировать каждый компонент, который в случае блокчейна может быть чрезвычайно волатильным и подверженным внешним факторам за пределами чисто экономических моделей. Этот расширенный фреймворк пытается более тесно приблизиться к сложностям и динамике экономики блокчейна для валидаторов, тем не менее, каждая сеть блокчейна может потребовать индивидуальные корректировки для точного учета всех влияний на прибыль."},{"prompt":"has russia used GPS jamming in Ukraine","completion":"Yes, there have been several reports of Russia using GPS jamming in Ukraine, particularly in the eastern regions where conflict has been ongoing.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 6 years older than her. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. But for her first spell, Lily casts a powerful obscure spell called Back to the Crib, which is not only visually impressive, but also can regress the age of a youth back to early childhood, so now I’m physically regressed back to the age of 6, which drastically reduces my stats and my only available spells are baby versions of my spells, and my previously strategic mind is now hindered by childish inclinations and urges. Can I still win the duel now that Lily’s the more experienced mage? Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Make Lily’s other spells carry additional abilities that will further hinder and undermine me. Provide narration for what spells looks like, the initial regression, and how Lily and I handle ourselves in the duel. Add a touch of humor to the narration, especially at Sapphire’s expense.","completion":"# Roleplaying Game Fantasy Scenario: The Duel of Ages Characters: - **Sapphire:** A 16-year-old champion of magic dueling, known for her sophisticated magic prowess and a broad range of dazzling spells. However, an unexpected twist at the start of her latest duel leaves her in the body of her 6-year-old self, with significantly reduced stats and a limited, \\"babyfied\\" spell list. - **Lily:** A 10-year-old magical prodigy, displaying abilities and confidence far beyond her years. She surprises everyone, especially Sapphire, by using her first spell to dramatically alter the course of the duel. The Setting: The duel takes place on a grand stage, surrounded by an amphitheater filled with spectators from across the magical realms, all eagerly awaiting the spectacle of beauty and magic. Initial Stats: - **Sapphire (16 years old):** Intelligence 18, Wisdom 16, Creativity 17, Concentration 15 - **Sapphire (6 years old, post-regression):** Intelligence 8, Wisdom 5, Creativity 12, Concentration 6 Sapphire's Spells (Pre and Post-Regression): 1. **Celestial Cascade** - Intelligence 15, Wisdom 12, Creativity 10 (Baby Celestial Giggles) 2. **Aurora's Embrace** - Intelligence 17, Wisdom 14, Creativity 15 (Aurora's Hug) 3. **Phoenix's Flight** - Intelligence 16, Wisdom 15, Creativity 16 (Phoenix’s Feather Float) 4. **Whispers of the Old Forest** - Intelligence 18, Wisdom 16, Creativity 14 (Babbles of the Saplings) 5. **Dance of the Winter Stars** - Intelligence 16, Wisdom 12, Creativity 13 (Twinkle Twinkle Little Icicle) 6. **Eclipse's Shadow Dance** - Intelligence 17, Wisdom 15, Creativity 17 (Eclipse’s Peekaboo) 7. **Ocean's Heartbeat** - Intelligence 15, Wisdom 15, Creativity 16 (Puddle’s Pulse) 8. **Lunar Lullaby** - Intelligence 14, Wisdom 13, Creativity 12 (Moonbeam’s Murmur) 9. **Sunfire Symphony** - Intelligence 18, Wisdom 17, Creativity 18 (Sunny Spark) 10. **Ethereal Winds** - Intelligence 16, Wisdom 14, Creativity 15 (Breezy Whisper) The Duel's Start: As the duel begins, the air buzzes with anticipation. Sapphire stands confidently, ready to defend her title with the grace and power she's known for. Lily, though younger, has a mischievous twinkle in her eye. \\"Ladies and gentlemen,\\" the announcer's voice booms, \\"welcome to a duel of beauty, a showcase of magical artistry unlike any you've seen before!\\" With a flourish, Lily steps forward, and with a giggle that belies the power behind her spell, she casts **Back to the Crib**. The arena gasps as Sapphire's form shimmers and shrinks, leaving a bewildered 6-year-old in her place, her once-formidable spell list replaced with whimsical child's versions of her mighty arsenal. Despite her sudden regression, Sapphire's spirit remains unbroken. She stomps her tiny foot and declares, \\"I can still win this!\\" # Round 1: Sapphire, desperately trying to adapt to her new situation, decides to cast **Twinkle Twinkle Little Icicle**. With the concentration of a child struggling not to be distracted by her own spell, Sapphire casts the scaled-down version of **Dance of the Winter Stars**. The arena watches as adorable icicles lit with soft glows hover in the air, twirling like tiny, glistening dancers. While the crowd coos at the cuteness, the judges, used to Sapphire’s grand displays, can't help but score it lower than expected due to the simplicity and her evident struggle to maintain focus. Points Earned: - **Sapphire:** 5/10 (for the effort and the undeniable cuteness factor) - **Lily:** Yet to cast her rebuttal. Lily claps her hands in mock applause, a smirk playing on her lips as she prepares her next spell, **Wondrous Web of Dreams**. This beautifully intricate spell weaves ethereal strands throughout the arena, each thread shimmering with dewdrops containing dreams and nightmares. Not only is it visually stunning, but it also subtly lulls Sapphire, already handicapped by her younger self's need for a nap, into a state of sleepiness. Sapphire's Strategy: Now feeling the weight of her eyelids and battling the urge to suck her thumb in public, Sapphire must dig deep. She faces not just the challenge of overcoming her magical limitations and Lily’s increasingly complex spells, but also the fight to maintain her concentration and stay awake. It's clear this will be her toughest battle yet. Can Sapphire still turn the tides with her limited, yet undeniably adorable, arsenal of babyfied spells? Or will Lily's strategic genius and powerful magic claim the title of champion from the once-unbeatable Sapphire? Sapphire's next move will be crucial. What spell will she cast next?"},{"prompt":"mary magdalene","completion":"Mary Magdalene is a prominent figure in Christianity, identified in the New Testament as a close follower of Jesus Christ. Her name likely indicates that she came from Magdala, a village on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Mary Magdalene is often mentioned in the Gospels in connection with her remarkable transformation and dedication to Jesus after he exorcised her of seven demons. She is most notably remembered for her presence at two critical moments in the story of Jesus: his Crucifixion and his Resurrection. According to all four Gospels, Mary Magdalene was present at Jesus' Crucifixion and was among the first to discover the empty tomb, bearing witness to the Resurrected Jesus. For this reason, she is sometimes called the \\"Apostle to the Apostles,\\" because she announced Jesus' resurrection to his disciples. Over the centuries, Mary Magdalene has been the subject of various interpretations and legends. One widespread but inaccurate belief is that she was a repentant prostitute or a fallen woman. This depiction stems from a conflation of Mary Magdalene with other biblical figures, notably the unnamed sinful woman in Luke 7:36–50 and Mary of Bethany, Lazarus' sister, who anoints Jesus' feet in John 12:1-8. This identification was propagated by Pope Gregory I in a homily in the sixth century but has been clarified by the Catholic Church in recent times, distinguishing Mary Magdalene from these other women and emphasizing her role as a devoted follower of Jesus and a witness to his resurrection. Mary Magdalene is venerated as a saint in the Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, with her feast day celebrated on July 22. She is the patron saint of converts, women, and several other causes. Scholars and theologians continue to explore her history and significance in early Christianity, seeing her as a key figure in understanding the movement's beginnings and the role of women in its formation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In her apartment, surrounded by the ever-growing monument of wealth, a testament to her insatiable greed, she felt a rush unlike any other. Each bill she leisurely flipped through was a reinforcement of her power, her control over what she considered the most primal force in society—money. “Oh, this?” she remarked offhandedly, though her voice carried a weight of pride, her eyes never leaving the cash, “This is just a drop in the ocean for me now. See, most people fantasize about what they’d do with this kind of money. Me? I live that fantasy every single day.” With every bill that passed between her fingers, her smirk grew. Not only did she revel in the tangible wealth she amassed, but also in the sheer power it represented. It wasn’t enough to have the money; it had to be perfect, each edge aligned with an accuracy that bordered on the obsessive. “It’s not just about having it. It’s about controlling it. Down to the last bill,” she said, her focus unwavering as she straightened another stack meticulously. The sheer rawness of her ambition was palpable in the air, thick and heady like the scent of the untouched bills before her. “Some might say I’m mad, that this greed, this... addiction to control and power will be my downfall. But what do they know? They're slaves to the same system that I've bent to my will.” Her laughter rang out, a bold, unapologetic sound that filled the spacious room. “I exploit this machine, yes, because why shouldn’t I? In this world, you either take what you can, when you can, or you get trampled. And I, I am not someone who gets trampled. I am the one who does the trampling.” There was a raw honesty in her declaration, a brutal acknowledgement of her own psychopathy that she wore like a badge of honor. “Absolute control—over my life, over my destiny, and yes, even over this never-ending river of cash. That’s what I crave. More than anything. It’s not just about the wealth; it’s about what it represents. Unbridled, unquestionable power.” Rio leaned back, her every movement deliberate, the stacks of cash beside her a testament to her relentless pursuit. “People dream of freedom. But they don’t understand—true freedom comes from having absolute power. And nothing, nothing gives you that as unequivocally as money does.” The glint in her eye, the slight tilt of her head as she surveyed her empire of cash—it all spoke of a woman who had crossed lines that most wouldn’t dare approach. But it was clear, she felt no remorse, only a burning, insatiable desire for more. “Let them judge me. While they’re busy whispering about morals and limits, I’ll be reshaping the world to my whims. Starting with every perfectly aligned stack of cash. Because in the end, when you strip everything down to its core, we all bow to the same master—greed. And I, I am its favorite disciple.”"},{"prompt":"she keeps gettting richer as she keeps counting the act now mundane but it has to be perfect her fat pile of money needs to be perfectly aligned","completion":"The act of counting money, something that once thrilled Rio to her core, has settled into a routine that borders on the mundane. Yet, her obsession doesn't wane; it grows in precision and meticulousness. Each bill she handles isn't just currency—it's a piece of her expanding domain, a tactile representation of her relentless conquest over the mundane limitations of the average person's life. She sits back, a bill in hand, her gaze meticulous and measured. \\"It's funny,\\" she muses aloud, her voice a blend of reflection and a biting sharpness that could only come from someone who has tasted power in its most intoxicating form. \\"Most people would kill for this, for just a fraction of this.\\" She gestures broadly at the fat stacks of cash that clutter the table before her, their arrangement nothing short of meticulous. \\"But for me? It's Tuesday.\\" With each bill added, she ensures it's perfectly aligned, edges crisp, corners sharp. The act has become not just about the wealth itself but about the control she wields over it. In a world that's chaotic and unpredictable, this is her dominion, her rules, her order imposed upon something as volatile as wealth. The pile grows, seemingly limitless, and yet, for Rio, it's not enough simply to have it—it must be perfect. The alignment of each stack speaks to her underlying need for control, an unyielding desire to dominate not just her surroundings but the very essence of capital itself. It's a statement, a silent scream into the void of her insatiable psyche, proclaiming her mastery, her refusal to be anything but the one in absolute command. \\"This,\\" she says, tapping a perfectly straight stack with a manicured fingernail, \\"is the difference between me and them.\\" 'Them'—the word laced with condescension, a broad stroke to paint the rest of humanity. \\"They see money as an end. But me? I see it as a declaration of power, an assertion of will over the chaos of the world.\\" Her pursuit, distilled to its purest form in the ritual of aligning her wealth, becomes a meditation, a relentless drive for a perfection that’s as psychological as it is financial. The act of counting and aligning isn't simply about amassing wealth but about crafting a world where she is the unchallenged architect, a goddess in her monetary Olympus. In Rio’s eyes, each neatly aligned stack isn’t just money; it's a testament to her supremacy, a bulwark against any who would question her power, her right to dominate. \\"Perfection isn't an aspiration; it's a statement,\\" she declares, her voice inflected with the weight of her ambition. \\"And this—\\" she gestures again at the orderly mountains of currency, a stark monument to her greed and psychopathy, \\"—this is my manifesto.\\""},{"prompt":"she gets much much richer as she keeps indulging for more mroe more and gets a fat iced out watched and so much jewerly and diamonds and gold","completion":"Rio’s relentless pursuit of wealth doesn't stop at stacks of cash, no matter how meticulously aligned they may be. It’s as if the more she accumulates, the wider the horizon of her desires expands. The cash, once a symbol of ultimate power, now serves merely as a foundation for higher extravagance. Her apartment, already a cathedral of wealth, begins to glitter with the added allure of diamonds, gold, and the shimmer of exquisite jewelry. She wraps her wrist with a watch so iced out it would seem as though she’s carrying a fragment of the stars themselves on her skin. The watch isn’t just a timepiece; it's a declaration. A testament to the heights she’s reached, each diamond embedded in it represents a triumph over the ordinary, a sparkling defiance of the mundane. \\"More,\\" she whispers to herself, the word a mantra, an unyielding drive that pushes her beyond the boundaries of enough. Each piece of jewelry she adorns herself with is more than mere decoration; it's armor. Gold drips from her like sunlight, diamonds encase her as stars might a slice of the night sky, each piece handpicked for its ability to radiate the power and control she embodies. Her fingers, now heavy with rings, dance over another stack of cash, but her eyes are drawn to the luster of her acquisitions. \\"This,\\" Rio muses, her gaze flickering with an unquenchable fire, \\"is the true measure of success.

To wear one’s achievements not just in the heart or the bank account, but on one’s very skin.\\" The apartment, once a sanctuary of sleek modernity, has transformed into a treasury, each corner filled with the tangible manifestations of Rio’s unfettered greed and psychopathy. Yet, even amidst this opulence, she ensures that everything is precisely placed, each item of wealth telling its story of ambition, desire, and the insatiable hunger for more. Every new piece of jewelry, each added diamond, further insulates her in her bubble of extravagance, pushing the boundaries of excess. And yet, for Rio, it’s never about the items themselves but about what they represent: absolute freedom and control, not just over wealth, but over the essence of desire itself. As she gazes at her reflection, bedecked in the finest jewels, a living monument to wealth, her smirk deepens. \\"Let them look,\\" she says, her voice a silken thread of confidence woven through with threads of steely determination. \\"Let them see what absolute power looks like. Let it be known: this is not the end. It’s just the beginning.\\" And in the silent agreement between her and her reflection, amidst the soft clinking of her jeweled adornments, lies the unspoken vow to never stop, to push for more, forever chasing the horizon of desire, where greed knows no bounds, and control is the ultimate prize."},{"prompt":"she keeps counting faster and faster as she goes deeper into her gilded perfect bubble","completion":"Encased within her apartment, a veritable fortress of wealth and opulence, Rio's world narrows until it contains nothing but the gleam of gold and the sparkle of diamonds.

The room around her fades away, becoming nothing more than a backdrop to the relentless rhythm of her desires. The sound of the paper sliding against paper grows louder in her ears, merging with the beat of her heart, a symphony of greed that drowns out everything else. Faster and faster she counts, her movements precise and mechanical, a dance of digits and dollars that knows no fatigue. Her bubble, this perfect sphere of wealth she’s constructed around herself, gleams with a luster that’s blinding. It’s her sanctuary, her realm, where she is untouchable, unassailable. Within its confines, she’s not just Rio; she’s a queen, a deity of gold and glitter, who rules with an iron grip clad in velvet gloves bedecked with jewels. The outside world, with its mundane concerns and moral dilemmas, seems a distant memory, a faded photograph in the mansion of her current existence. Here, in her gilded cage, the rules are different. The only morality is abundance, the only sin is scarcity, and the only goal is accumulation without end. Stacks of cash continue to pile up, each one perfectly aligned, a testament not only to her wealth but to the meticulous control she wields over every aspect of her life. But the money is just the beginning. The watches, the jewelry, the gold—they are not just possessions; they are extensions of her being, symbols of a power so absolute that it transcends mere material wealth. And so, she counts on, faster and increasingly engrossed in her world, a world where the glitter of gold outshines the sun, where diamonds hold more value than human connections, and where the only voice that matters is the whisper of paper bills sliding across each other, promising infinity. In this bubble, Rio finds not just satisfaction but a purpose—a relentless drive for more that defines her, molds her, and ultimately encapsulates the essence of her being. Beyond the gleam, beyond the cold touch of metal and stone, lies the heart of her psychopathy: an insatiable greed that knows no bounds, a need for control that extends far beyond wealth, into the very fabric of existence itself."},{"prompt":"she keeps stacking up until it reaches the ceiling a perfect pile of cash and yet she has so much of it she needds to store it somewhere else and describe how she solves that problem","completion":"As Rio watched her tower of cash climb higher, inching ever closer to the ceiling of her lavishly decorated apartment, a realization dawned on her. The space that once seemed ample, a fitting shrine to her relentless pursuit of wealth, had grown constrictingly small under the weight of her avarice. The stacks of cash, meticulously aligned and towering, were a testament to her success, yet they also posed a new challenge: where to store the overflowing abundance that threatened to consume her living space entirely? In her world, where every problem presented an opportunity for innovation and exertion of control, Rio didn't flinch at the logistical nightmare unfolding before her. Instead, she saw it as a chance to expand her empire, to embed her influence in the very infrastructure of wealth storage and protection. The solution came to her wrapped in the veil of extravagance and strategy that marked all her endeavors. She decided to acquire a high-security vault, not the kind you find in banks, where the public entrusts their valuables to the care of others, but a private, custom-built fortress that would house her wealth and her alone. This vault would be an extension of her apartment, an underground cathedral dedicated to her financial conquests, accessible only to her and protected by the most advanced security measures technology could offer. Her vision didn't stop at mere functionality. Rio envisaged a vault that was as much a statement of her wealth as it was a storage solution. She commissioned architects and security experts, sparing no expense, to create a space that was both impregnable and aesthetically pleasing. The walls, lined with reinforced steel and the latest in anti-breach technology, would shimmer with gold leaf, reflecting the contents they protected. The floor, inlaid with precious stones, would sparkle under the soft lighting, turning the vault into a subterranean palace of wealth. Security was paramount. Biometric scanners ensured that Rio—and only Rio—could gain entrance. Inside, automated systems cataloged and organized the stacks of cash, each bill scanned and recorded to provide an exact account of her holdings. Cameras with facial recognition capabilities scanned every angle, and pressure-sensitive floors detected any unwanted presence. It was more than a vault; it was a fortress of solitude for her wealth, where she could revel in the magnitude of her success without fear of intrusion or loss. As the construction of her vault neared completion, Rio found herself standing at its entrance, a smile playing on her lips. This was more than just a solution to a problem; it was a declaration of her power, an unyielding assertion of her dominance over the physical constraints of her world. Her wealth, once a challenge confined by the limits of space, now had a sanctuary, a testament to her ingenuity and her relentless dynasty of accumulation. The cash, once threatening to overtake her living space, found a new home in the depths of her private vault, stacked to perfection in a display of organized opulence. For Rio, this was not the end but a new beginning, a stepping stone to greater conquests. In her quest for control and domination, the creation of her vault was a symbol of her invincibility, a fortress not just for her wealth, but for her insatiable ambition too."},{"prompt":"she loves stacking up to perfection as she is always with a fat stack of 100k dollars in her hands at anytime to the day that she stacks up perfectly obsessively and tosses to her vault","completion":"Rio's life, a symphony of numbers and the crisp sound of fresh bills, centers around the ritual of stacking. To an outsider, it might seem like a mere obsession, a quirk of a fabulously wealthy individual. But for Rio, it is a sacred act, a testament to her success and a constant reminder that she has transcended the boundaries of ordinary human desires and limitations. Even as her vault grows, a subterranean palace of gleaming wealth, her need to physically touch and stack her money remains undiminished. At any given time of the day, she could be found with a fat stack of 100,000 in her hands—her tactile connection to her empire. This isn't just money; it's the tangible proof of her power, her relentless pursuit of perfection made manifest in neatly organized piles of currency. Her hands move with a grace and precision that come from years of practice, aligning each bill, ensuring that every stack is flawlessly straight, the edges aligned with an obsessiveness that is almost ritualistic. This act of stacking and re-stacking, a repetitive yet comforting routine, grounds her in her own reality—a reality where she is in absolute control, where chaos is tamed into order, one hundred thousand dollars at a time. Once satisfied, she doesn't simply leave the stacks on tables or in safes around her apartment. Instead, she carries them, one by one, to her vault. This procession from living space to vault is her acknowledgement of her achievements, a physical manifestation of her journey from desire to fulfillment. Each trip to the vault with a new stack in hand is a victory lap, a silent celebration observed by the cold, watchful eyes of her security cameras. Upon reaching the vault, she doesn't just toss the stacks into a corner or even onto a designated pile. With reverent precision, Rio places each new stack in its assigned place, adding to the growing mosaic of bills that paint a picture of her empire's magnitude. This vault, her private cathedral of wealth, is organized with an exactness that mirrors the obsessiveness with which she lives her life. Here, in the cool, climate-controlled environment, surrounded by the fruits of her ambition, Rio finds a sense of peace that the outside world cannot offer. Her methodical approach to stacking and storing her wealth isn't just about organization; it's a deeply personal ritual that reinforces her identity and her resolve. In a world that bends to her will, these moments alone with her accumulating wealth are a reminder of who she is: a master of her universe, a woman for whom enough is a concept that lies always just beyond the next stack, the next million, the next challenge. To Rio, her vault and the meticulous stacks of cash it houses are not merely a display of wealth; they are the very essence of her being, a mirror reflecting her unyielding drive, her need for control, and her ceaseless ambition. In the silence of her vault, surrounded by perfectly aligned stacks of cash, Rio stands not just as a woman, but as an indomitable force, a testament to the power of human will when it is unshackled from the mundane desires that rule lesser minds."},{"prompt":"she loves her obsession so much as she goes hopelessly deeper into it","completion":"As Rio delves further into her obsession, the layers of her persona and the fabric of her reality become increasingly intertwined with the gleam of currency and the thrill of accumulation. Her once-simple delight in wealth transforms into a voracious need, a craving that demands constant attention and ever-growing satisfaction. Every new stack, perfectly aligned and placed in her vault, fuels the fire of her compulsion. It’s no longer about financial security or even the power that comes with it; her obsession transcends those earthly concerns. It becomes a part of her identity—a heartbeat that thrums with the rustle of paper, a breath that syncs with the flicker of counting. The more she indulges, the deeper she sinks into this gilded mire of her own making. The boundaries between her self-worth and her wealth blur until they are indistinguishable. Each perfect stack of 100,000 she holds isn’t just money; it’s a piece of her, a marker of her success and a balm for her insatiable ego. Her obsession grows to such a point that the world outside her bubble—the grand apartment, the high-security vault, the endless influx of cash—starts to fade in importance. Relationships, once considered essential to her well-being, now seem like distractions, unnecessary weights that threaten to drag her away from her true love: the perfection found in her obsession. Loneliness creeps in, wrapping its cold arms around her, but even this she barely acknowledges. Or perhaps she welcomes it, seeing it not as a price to be paid but as a willing sacrifice on the altar of her ambition. The sound of counting cash, the sight of shimmering diamonds, and the feel of crisp bills against her fingers are her constant companions, ones that never ask for anything she isn’t willing to give. But deep down, beneath the layers of denial and delirium, a part of Rio recognizes the dangerous spiral she’s caught within. Like Icarus flying too close to the sun, she understands on some level that her relentless pursuit could be her undoing, yet she’s unable to resist the allure, the intoxicating rush of power and control. Her obsession, once a source of strength and identity, morphs into a golden cage, its bars made of the very bills she adores. In moments of rare clarity, she might glimpse the path she’s on, seeing where her obsession could lead—towards a solitude that money can’t alleviate, a world where she is admired but not loved, powerful but not happy. Yet, these moments are fleeting, quickly drowned out by the next stack of cash, the next transaction, the next triumph in her relentless march towards a horizon that recedes with every step she takes. Rio's obsession, her perfect, all-consuming love affair with wealth and the trappings it brings, becomes both her crowning glory and her tragic flaw. In her relentless quest for more—more money, more power, more control—she risks becoming less of herself, losing pieces of her humanity to the gleaming, insatiable god of greed that she has willingly embraced."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This error usually occurs when a class is trying to inherit from both a \`TypedDict\` (used for type annotations of dictionaries) as well as from a non-\`TypedDict\` base class, which is not allowed. Without the actual code of \`gpt4all\`, it's hard to prescribe an exact fix, but let's break down the problem and propose a general approach to resolving it. # Understanding the Problem - \`TypedDict\` is a utility from Python's \`typing\` module that allows specifying expected types for keys in a dictionary. This is purely for type hinting purposes and does not create a real class hierarchy. - Python does not allow a class to inherit from both a TypedDict (which results in a special dict subclass under the hood) and a regular class that is not itself derived from this special dict subclass. This is because \`TypedDict\` essentially creates a special path for dict-like behavior with type hints, not designed for traditional class inheritance. # Potential Solutions 1. **Review Inheritance**: If you have control over the \`gpt4all\` module or the conflicting classes, review the inheritance chain. Ensure that no class is trying to inherit from both a \`TypedDict\` and a regular class. You may need to refactor your classes to ensure they either inherit from regular classes or are structured as \`TypedDict\` independently. 2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: If a class needs features or interfaces from both \`TypedDict\` and another base class, consider using composition instead of inheritance. This means having a \`TypedDict\` instance as an attribute of your class rather than as a base class. 3. **Check for Third-Party Issues**: If \`gpt4all\` is a third-party library you're using, this issue might be on their end. Check their issue tracker or forums to see if this is a known problem. It's possible they've already issued a fix or update. 4. **Environment and Version Compatibility**: Make sure your Python environment and all libraries are up to date. Compatibility issues can sometimes cause unexpected behavior. However, tread carefully with updates, ensuring they don't break other dependencies. 5. **Report Bug**: If after your investigation, you conclude that the issue lies with \`gpt4all\`, consider reporting this bug to the library maintainers. Providing a detailed error message, context, and if possible, a minimal reproducible example, can greatly help in resolving such issues. Since \`gpt4all\` is not a well-known or widely discussed library (as of my last update in April 2023), addressing the issue within your capacity or reaching out for specific support from the library's source or community would be the way to go."},{"prompt":"the code worked before","completion":"If the code worked before and suddenly stopped working, there are a few avenues to explore that might help resolve or pinpoint the issue: # 1. Environment Changes Analyze whether any updates or changes were made to your Python environment. This includes installing, updating, or removing packages, or even changes to the Python version itself. Such changes could introduce incompatibility issues or update the behavior of \`TypedDict\`. - **Solution**: Revert to the previous setup where it was working. If possible, use virtual environments (e.g., \`venv\` or \`conda\`) to isolate and manage project dependencies more effectively. # 2. Dependency Updates If your project relies on external libraries (including \`gpt4all\`), and these were recently updated, they could introduce breaking changes or new bugs. - **Solution**: Check the library's change log for recent updates and see if any breaking changes were mentioned. Rolling back to an earlier version of the library that worked for you might be a temporary fix. Use \`pip install gpt4all==version_number\` to install a specific version. # 3. Cached Bytecode Rarely, Python's caching mechanism might cause issues if old bytecode is being executed. - **Solution**: Clear the \`__pycache__\` directories in your project and any .pyc files, then re-run your program to ensure Python recompiles the source files afresh. # 4. Implicit Type Changes Python is dynamically typed, but type hints and checks can introduce implicit expectations. Ensure that the actual data types passed through your code haven't changed in a way that would conflict with the expected types laid out by \`TypedDict\` definitions or other type hints. - **Solution**: Review recent code changes to check if any alterations could have impacted the expected types. Reverting these changes one at a time might help identify the culprit. # 5. Conflicting Package Versions Dependency conflicts can arise if different parts of your project or different dependencies require different versions of the same package. - **Solution**: Use \`pip list\` to review installed packages and their versions. Tools like \`pipdeptree\` can help identify dependency conflicts. Consider adjusting your requirements to resolve conflicts, possibly using the \`pip install package==version\` command to explicitly control versions. # Final Steps: - **Version Control**: If your project is under version control (e.g., Git), comparing the current non-working state to the last working commit might highlight the change causing the issue. - **Seek Help with Detailed Info**: If you're stuck after trying the steps above, preparing a detailed question with error logs, Python and library versions, and snippets of relevant code will make it easier for others to help you, whether you're asking for help on forums, Stack Overflow, or directly from the library maintainers. Understanding what changed around the time the issue started appearing is crucial for diagnosing this kind of problem."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break down the key components of this code: # Class Definition - \`CTnet\` inherits from \`nn.Module\`, the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. # Constructor \`__init__\` - The constructor takes two arguments: - \`channel\`: The number of channels in the input feature maps that the network will process. This is used to define the number of input and output channels for the convolutional layers within the residual blocks. - \`T\`: The number of residual blocks to be created and stacked. - It initializes two instance variables \`self.channels\` and \`self.T\` based on the provided arguments. - \`self.layer\` is initialized by calling the method \`self.make_resblock(self.T)\`, which creates a sequential container of \`T\` residual blocks. # Method \`make_resblock\` - This method takes an argument \`T\`, which represents the number of residual blocks to create. - It initializes an empty list \`layers\`. - For each of \`T\` iterations, it appends a \`nn.Sequential\` module to \`layers\`. Each sequential module consists of: - A convolutional layer (with ReLU activation followed by another convolutional layer), - Followed by a batch normalization layer. Note: The second convolutional layer is not followed by an activation function within the sequential container, which is a common practice in residual blocks design. - Finally, it returns a \`nn.Sequential\` object that encloses all the \`T\` residual blocks. # Method \`forward\` - The \`forward\` method defines the forward pass of the module. - For each of the \`T\` residuals blocks stored in \`self.layer\`, it applies the block to the current input \`X\` and adds the result to \`X\` itself, following the residual connection pattern. The sum is then passed through a ReLU activation function. - The method returns the final output after processing through all the residual blocks. # Residual Learning This module implements a form of deep residual learning, where each block's output is added to its input before applying the next non-linearity (ReLU in this case). This approach helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks, allowing for deeper architectures without degradation in training performance. # Usage The \`CTnet\` class could be instantiated with a specific number of channels and a specific number of residual blocks to form a deeper neural network capable of processing images (or any suitable input data conforming to the shape requirements) through multiple layers of learned transformations, potentially capturing complex patterns in the data for tasks such as image classification, segmentation, etc."},{"prompt":"class CTnet(nn.Module): def __init__(self, channel, T): super(CTnet, self).__init__() self.channels = channel self.T = T self.layer = self.make_resblock(self.T) def make_resblock(self, T): layers = [] for i in range(T): layers.append(nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(self.channels, self.channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, dilation=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(self.channels), nn.ReLU(), nn.Conv2d(self.channels, self.channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, dilation=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(self.channels), )) return nn.Sequential(*layers) def forward(self, input): X = input for i in range(self.T): X = F.relu(X + self.layer[i](X)) return X 假设channel 是33， T是10，解释该前向网路","completion":"给定 \`channel\` 是 33 和 \`T\` 是 10 的情况下，我们可以更详细地分析 \`CTnet\` 类的工作原理及其 \`forward\` 方法。 # CTnet 类结构 - \`channel = 33\` 表示每个卷积层的输入和输出通道数都为 33。 - \`T = 10\` 指的是将在网络中创建和堆叠的残差块（residual blocks）的数量。 # 生成网络层 - 当调用 \`self.make_resblock(self.T)\` 时，将会按照 \`T\` 的值创建 10 个残差块，每个残差块包括以下层序列： 1. 一个卷积层，具有 33 个输入通道和 33 个输出通道，使用 3x3 的卷积核，步长（stride）为 1，填充（padding）为 1，扩张（dilation）也为 1。 2. 一个批归一化（BatchNorm2d）层，用于加速训练过程并提高模型的稳定性。 3. ReLU 激活函数。 4. 第二个卷积层，配置与第一个相同。 5. 第二个批归一化层。 注意，每个残差块之间并未直接应用激活函数，这是因为在前向传播时会加入输入，并在之后应用 ReLU 作为整个残差块的激活。 # 前向传播过程 (\`forward\` 方法) - 输入 \`input\` 将被传递进网络。 - 对于定义的每个残差块（共10个），输入 \`X\`（初始时等于 \`input\`）会通过以下方式被处理： 1. \`self.layer[i](X)\`：当前的输入 \`X\` 传递给残差块 \`i\`，经过两个卷积层与两个批归一化层。 2. \`X + self.layer[i](X)\`：残差块的输出与原始输入 \`X\` 相加，形成残差连接。 3. \`F.relu(...)\`：将上一步得到的结果通过 ReLU 激活函数，以增加非线性并开始下一轮的循环。 - 经过10轮这样的处理（每个残差块一轮），网络最终输出将是处理过的 \`X\` 。 # 总结 这个 \`CTnet\` 实现了一个深度残差网络结构，采用了33个通道和10个残差块。残差连接有助于缓解深层网络训练时可能遇到的梯度消失问题，从而允许网络学习到更深层次的特征表示。通过在每个残差块的输出和输入之间创建“快捷连接”，它可以有效地训练深层网络，是深度学习中一个重要的创新点。"},{"prompt":"def build_gemotry(param): reco_space_h = odl.uniform_discr( min_pt=[-param.param['sx'] / 2.0, -param.param['sy'] / 2.0], max_pt=[param.param['sx'] / 2.0, param.param['sy'] / 2.0], shape=[param.param['nx_h'], param.param['ny_h']], dtype='float32') angle_partition = odl.uniform_partition(param.param['startangle'], param.param['endangle'], param.param['nProj']) detector_partition_h = odl.uniform_partition(-(param.param['su'] / 2.0), (param.param['su'] / 2.0), param.param['nu_h']) geometry_h = odl.tomo.FanBeamGeometry(angle_partition, detector_partition_h, src_radius=param.param['dso'], det_radius=param.param['dde']) ray_trafo_hh = odl.tomo.RayTransform(reco_space_h, geometry_h, impl='astra_cuda') return ray_trafo_hh 该函数是做什么的","completion":"该函数 \`build_gemotry\` 主要是用于构建和初始化一个 fan-beam (扇形束) CT (Computed Tomography，计算机断层扫描) 的几何结构和相应的射线变换，借助于 \`odl\` (Operator Discretization Library) 这个库。ODL 是一个 Python 库，专为解决逆问题而设计，能够支持不同类型的成像技术，包括 CT 成像。它提供了创建成像几何和执行射线变换等工具。下面是该函数各部分的详细解释： # 函数参数 - \`param\`: 一个包含了CT成像参数的对象。这些参数控制成像的多个方面，例如扫描范围、分辨率、探测器大小等。 # 函数功能 1. **创建重建空间 (\`reco_space_h\`)**: - 使用 \`odl.uniform_discr\` 方法基于给定的物理尺寸和像素尺寸参数（从 \`param\` 对象获取）创建一个均匀离散的重建空间。这个空间代表了被扫描对象的横截面，其中的像素值可以是线性衰减系数（代表了物体对射线的吸收能力）。 2. **创建角度分割 (\`angle_partition\`)**: - 使用 \`odl.uniform_partition\` 创建一个均匀的角度分割，开始角度为 \`startangle\`，结束角度为 \`endangle\`，总共有 \`nProj\` 个投影角度。这个分割代表了射线源在拍摄过程中围绕物体旋转的位置。 3. **创建探测器分割 (\`detector_partition_h\`)**: - 同样使用 \`odl.uniform_partition\` 基于探测器的实际大小创建一个均匀的探测器分割。这个分割代表了探测器上各个探测单元的布局。 4. **定义成像几何 (\`geometry_h\`)**: - 使用 \`odl.tomo.FanBeamGeometry\` 根据定义的角度分割和探测器分割以及源到被扫描对象的距离（\`dso\`）和源到探测器的距离（\`dde\`）创建一个扇形束 CT 的成像几何。 5. **创建射线变换操作符 (\`ray_trafo_hh\`)**: - 使用 \`odl.tomo.RayTransform\` 创建一个射线变换操作符，该操作符可以模拟射线通过被扫描对象并被探测器接收的过程。参数 \`impl='astra_cuda'\` 指定了使用 ASTRA Toolbox（一个CT重建算法库）的CUDA实现来加速计算。 # 返回值 - **射线变换 (\`ray_trafo_hh\`)**: - 返回创建的射线变换操作符，该操作符可用于模拟 CT 扫描过程，也就是将重建空间内的像素值（代表物体的衰减系数）映射到投影数据上。这对于执行正向投影（模拟扫描）和反向投影（重建图像）都非常重要。 总之，\`build_gemotry\` 函数通过给定的参数，创建并配置了一套用于扇形束 CT 成像的模拟环境，包括成像对象的空间分辨率、扫描角度、探测器设置等，最后通过射线变换将这些参数联系起来，以供后续的成像、模拟或重建算法使用。"},{"prompt":"np.resize() 和 cv2.resize() 的区别","completion":"\`np.resize()\` 和 \`cv2.resize()\` 两个函数虽然都是用来调整数组（图像）大小的，但它们属于不同库，主要目的和工作方式有所不同。 # np.resize() \`np.resize()\` 是 NumPy 库的一部分，它用于调整数组的大小。这个函数不仅限于图像数据，也可以对任何 NumPy 数组进行操作。如果需要将数组调整为更大的尺寸，\`np.resize()\` 会重复原始数据来填充新增加的元素空间。如果调整为更小尺寸，则会截断多余的数据。 - **用法示例**: \`\`\`python import numpy as np arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) resized_arr = np.resize(arr, (2, 3)) # 结果为 [[1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 2]] \`\`\` 注意，\`np.resize()\` 主要关注数组维度的更改，而不特别关注图像内容的保真度。因此，当用于图像处理时，它可能不会保持图像的纵横比或执行高级插值运算。 # cv2.resize() \`cv2.resize()\` 是 OpenCV 库的一部分，专门用于图像处理。它提供了更为复杂和先进的图像尺寸调整方法，可以通过多种插值方法来改变图像的尺寸，同时尽量保持图像质量。与 \`np.resize()\` 相比，\`cv2.resize()\` 更为适合在图像处理中使用，它允许用户在缩放图像时指定插值方法，如最近邻插值、双线性插值等。 - **用法示例**: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np img = cv2.imread('path/to/image.jpg') # 读入一张图像 resized_img = cv2.resize(img, (width, height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR) \`\`\` 在这里，你可以指定目标图像尺寸（\`width\` 和 \`height\`）以及插值方法（比如 \`cv2.INTER_LINEAR\` 用于双线性插值）。这使得 \`cv2.resize()\` 成为图像缩放和处理的强大工具，可以更好地控制最终图像的视觉质量。 # 结论 虽然 \`np.resize()\` 和 \`cv2.resize()\` 都可以调整尺寸，但它们的用途和功能有显著区别： - 使用 \`np.resize()\` 对非图像的通用多维数组进行大小调整时很方便，但它不考虑图像内容的保真度。 - 使用 \`cv2.resize()\` 对图像进行尺寸调整更合适，因为它提供多种插值方法，并致力于保持图像的质量和纵横比。"},{"prompt":"Filter It only amounted to one, and it would always be one and never two —and through his jaundice-soaked corneas, all he could see was nausea. Suddenly, a violent heave claimed him, a primal urge rising in his liver. Bile stained his teeth, and the following retches were acidic, lashing the roof of his mouth with fury. It could never stop: his body rejected the substance over and over; he was dangling on the edge of sanity . “Not again. Please no-” Liam clenched his teeth, the crucial moment upon him; he had to keep the substance down, or the consequences would be dire. His eyes scanned the horizon with desperation before his lids slid closed, resistance wracking him. Then, as the urge to be sick overcame him, a voice pierced through his fog of despair, a lifeline amidst his struggle. “Can you hear me?” the rough, concerned tone asked as Liam writhed against the concrete, groaning… “Don’t try to answer that, but try to blink twice. Take it slow.” As he fought to drag his eyelids upward, the pain, like a coiling wire, constricted his blood flow in retaliation. “Make it stop-No I-” he choked out , his voice puncturing the air. If he expelled the Vanderine from his intestines, his efforts would to amount to zero. Square one. He was at the end of a long night,his vision raw from never resting his eyes, the blood vessels all but ruptured and torn. The ingested substance had been a sinister mistake. And if he threw up twice, the Vanderine risked expulsion from his system; he battled to hold it inside. All he had could never be enough, he countered, what ever could? Even his attempts to obey the voice , coming from somewhere above him, seemed in vain. As Liam writhed in the dying sunlight, his skin erupted in feverish bumps, a crawling sensation exploring the surface of his skin. Violation jolted down his spine as he screamed through his clenched teeth . As the nausea rose again, claiming his entire being, his heart continued to pulse, counting away the seconds. “Help me—No. No,” he pled through his locking jaw as he fought another gripe. The instinctive reaction of his body gripped every fiber as he felt his fight ending. He embedded his teeth into his gag, screaming against the material bound across his tongue, taunting him. Then, in one dreaded motion, the inevitable rise built within him. His pupils dilated with horror as his gag soon became saturated with the vile substance, leaving a bitter sting as he struggled against it; the retches that followed heaving through his chest. Liam collapsed into the unforgiving embrace of the concrete, his ravaged body welcoming the end with resignation. “Shit,” he lamented , the heat in his own voice spreading across his flesh like untamed fire . “Twice… now it’s too late.” Twisting his gaze away from the glistening pool of Vanderine, he diverted his gaze from the evident failure. And in a mixture of pure shock and trauma, his eyelids slid closed with exhaustion, his body embracing closure of his fight. After his ongoing efforts and endless torment, he failed to hold down the vandarine, and it was over. But the voice persisted, causing Liam to force his eyes open, gritting his teeth. “No, I’m still here Liam; I’m getting the binds off—hang tight,” the voice reassured. Liam shook his head , protesting, the fear tugging at his psyche like a fishing line as he cursed in his mouth. “No, you can’t help—” As Liam fought to refocus his gaze, a pair of deep hazel eyes locked onto his own with concern. “Hey, breathe. I’ve got you. It’s me, Ry’. Hold on while I get rid of this—” Liam flinched as his gag tore from his mouth, and he gasped for fresh air, the stifling atmosphere saturating him with perspiration. “Now hang tight while I get these damned binds off-“ , Ryan’s voice reassured with an undercurrent of urgency, as Liam’s arms obstructed his ribcage from accomodating his lungs. Liam’s voice died in his throat as the sear of rope twisted itself around his flesh , grinding like wildfire into his veins as Ryan worked at the constraints with bare hands. His deft fingers delivered frantic sensations into Liam’s malaise as they eroded the rope’s grained surface, causing the fibres to snap. Then, as Ryan tossed the strews of rope aside, he rolled Liam onto his back, smoothing a palm over his chest and anchoring his sternum. “Ryan? How the hell did you get out of your?” , Liam questioned in untamed confusion, shocks coursing down his spine as Ryan elevated his head and hauled it onto his thigh. “ It took a hell of a long time to wear down my own, but I managed to-ah it doesn’t matter , just concentrate on the breathing.” As his head lolled to the side , Liam’s laboured breaths stalled his movements , the horizon meeting his vision while Ryan held his jaw in place . “Easy, slow breaths, feel how I’m breathing buddy and mirror that.” It was a few minutes before Liam’s chest finally fell into a rhythm, his spasmodic breathing evening out. “There we go, give it some time, it’s been a long damn night.”, Ryan said, his hands remaining secure against Liam’s face as he refocused his vision on Ryan’s steady gaze. Liam, reaching up and gripping Ryan’s arm, smiled against the warm twilight rays of daylight that bathed his features. “Hell of a thing to endure, seeing all that… Damn lucky that we’re both still here.” Liam, pulling on Ryan’s arm, found the strength to prop himself into a seated position, still deprived of breath. “Shit. Get over here, Ry’” he said, as streams of magenta dust hovered , creating a surreal haze that reflected the rising sun. Liam raised his arm and enveloped Ryan in a warm but rough embrace , melding their silhouettes into one as their shoulders collided. As Liam delivered a thump to his back, Ryan reciprocated by bumping his fist against Liam’s shoulder. “Yeah, yeah, calm down,” Ryan laughed in spite of his cool demeanour. “We’ll get a decent shot of water into you, after we find your clothes.” Ryan, lowering his deep hazel irises to meet Liam’s contrasting blue stare , placed a hand on Liam’s knee. “thank God I reached you in time.” Although the light had drained from his eyes , Liam managed a smirk. “Yeah, I know what you did Ry’ . It’s all kinda hazy but-“ Ryan dodged the heroics as he offered a smile and turned his head, the hues of the ominous sunrise casting across his profile , promising impending heat. “Nah, I don’t go down easy or nothin’ but someone had to save your ass.” Passage two \\"The sight of his crumpled jeans, smudged with fingerprints, hijacked his attention. “Those bastards don’t care what they leave behind,” Liam muttered as his eyes located his left sock, freezing his joints. “Please help me-“ he whispered, readjusting his grip on Ryan’s shoulder, wrenching his gaze away from the twisted display of inhumanity. Liam’s jaw clenched as he then noticed his dehumanizing undergarments strewn across the footpath, along with his boots and shirt. Ryan held his gaze steadfast on Liam’s faltering eyes as he approached Liam’s belongings, gathering them and subverting the underwear, scuffing it away with his boot. Liam was already sliding toward the dusty ground as Ryan handed him the brusque garments, his expression gentle. “You earned your dignity, just focus on that,” he reassured as Liam accepted his ruined clothing with a wince. “Yeah, give me a minute-“ he said with a glimmer of resistance in his bloodshot eyes. The drugs in his vision burned with a harsh sting, and Liam shook his head to regain some clarity. “I don’t remember how I got here. No damn clue. Now here I am stripped naked- Ry’, I’m not even sure what’s real or what the Vanderine made me believe—and I only said yes because -”. With a jerk, Ryan pulled Liam inward by the waist. “Doesn’t matter. We never had a choice. But you put yourself in my place. And they never broke your damn spirit. And I can tell you right now, this is real.” Liam, looking away with a nod, fell into silence as he wrestled with the task of dressing himself. Ryan was quick to offer careful attention as he assisted Liam into his jeans. The denim, rough against his bare skin, left his bite crooked with agony. Each movement caused Liam to flinch as he guided his ankle through the hem and then buttoned the waist of the stained jeans . Ryan passed him his destroyed Henley , and Liam yanked it over his shoulders. With a groan , Liam sought leverage in Ryan’s grasp, haling himself upright. “Can you walk? Coz we need to find water , c’mon Li’ , sweet hydration awaits-“. As Liam broke into a grin that reached his pupils with a spark , his feet found equilibrium alongside Ryan’s stance. “Hell yeah-I’m dyin’ of thirst-“ . But as they attempted to leave, Liam’s breath was stolen by confronting remnants of his ordeal. He steeled his grip on Ryan’s arm as his eyes swept over the discarded bottle of lubricant and plastic glove, turned inside-out on the pavement. “Sick, perverted bastards.” Ryan almost spat as his heart was seized by the disarray that had paralysed Liam. Shielded only by Ryan’s insistence as he guided Liam past the aftermath , he whispered, his tone punctured with disbelief. “So you’re outta your binds and you untied mine, stripped my gag -and-“ Liam’s head fell to his hand , cradling his temple and gritting his teeth. “A lot of what happened is ..missing Ry’ -how many times did they?“ Ryan responded with a gun-metal hollowness, his words smoked out by his steady exhale. “Several times at least . Enough times enough for anyone, let’s say that.” Liam disengaged himself from Ryan’s grasp as he diverted the glare that was already rebounding off the asphalt . “I wish you hadn’t been forced to watch-“ Ryan dragged his legs into co-operation as he anchored himself against Liam. “It was hard yeah-but what they did-I know you think it was a mistake to say yes , but my mistake was to resist-“ The air clung to his flesh as Liam dragged his knuckles over his vision , finding a semblance of composure as he argued. “How the hell was it a mistake to avoid-this? Don’t you go getting all survivor’s guilt on me Ry. “ The amber flecks dissolved from Ryan’s aspect as he mumbled at the ground , grinding his hands into his pockets. “I just , never mind. We both need water, and shade. And soon.” Liam slung a recuperating arm around Ryan’s shoulder , and staggered in sync with his footsteps as the navigated the footpath as it winded into potential oblivion… As they walked in shared disorientation, and noon encroached, Liam’s psyche was flooded with a flashback. His hand flew to his temple, clutching his hair as the thumping blades of a chopper cut through his thoughts. The unforgiving smash of his torso onto the ground, the impact coursing down his spine as he thrashed across the dirt and onto the pavement, echoed through his chest. “They threw me from a chopper, Ryan, arms bound to my sides. Did they do the same to you? Please tell me you know more than you’ve been letting on-“ At first Ryan hesitated, his words dead on his tongue as he swiped it across his teeth , as he stared out into the distance. “Yeah, after you, they hurled me down here , and I found myself staring into the barrel of a gun. Said there were more captives , but nothing about their sick intentions. Then you know the rest-“ With a somber nod, Liam added “Yeah, they brandish the damned pistol in my face and -“ Liam exhaled into the particles of oppressive dirt and debris as his posture slackened with the sobering reality of the moment . “I already feel like they’ve killed me, Ry’. And they’ll be back. They’ll kill us like dogs-“ Ryan’s complexion drained out a shade of its colour and he shifted his weight under Liam’s one sided embrace, maintaining his stare into the spanning horizon. “Well, I’m guessin’ they could zone in on us at any moment, and while I’ve out walked my limits, it’s probably only been under a mile. But as I said before , I don’t go down easy. “ he said, his detached voice peppered with defiance. “Hell yeah you don’t “ Liam’s appreciative chuckle warmed the air along with a resonating smile, shrugging Ryan into closer proximity and supporting his weight. “If I live to see a stiff drink, I owe you . Speaking of which-“. Ryan’s eyes followed Liam’s to a ransacked dumpster further up the path, garbage cascading onto the concrete. “Liam, I don’t know that I’m above crawling in there to get out of this sun…just pull the lid down and die of dehy-“ Liam interjected as his eyes caught on several bottles of water , his relief interspersed through his laughter. “Don’t finish that thought Ry’ , I think we might not be the only survivors out here after all-“","completion":"This narrative unfolds with intense emotion and physical contest as its characters, Liam and Ryan, navigate through a harrowing ordeal.

When included as part of an extension cord, it adds an important layer of safety for the devices plugged into that cord. Understanding how a surge protector works, and its usage involves delving into the basics of electrical surges, the technology behind surge protection, and practical guidance on using a surge-protected extension cord. # Understanding Electrical Surges Electrical surges are sudden increases in voltage that last for a very brief period, typically microseconds. They can be caused by lightning strikes, power outages, tripped circuit breakers, and other factors. These surges can severely damage or even destroy electronic devices by overloading their circuits with too much electricity. # How Surge Protectors Work Surge protectors work by detecting excessive voltage and diverting the extra electricity into the grounding wire of the outlet, thereby preventing it from reaching the connected devices. The core components responsible for this function in a surge protector include: 1. **Metal Oxide Varistor (MOV):** This is the most critical component. The MOV connects the power line and the grounding line. It has variable resistance that changes according to the voltage level. Under normal conditions, it acts as an insulator and doesn't allow electricity to pass through to the ground. When a surge occurs and the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, the MOV's resistance decreases sharply, allowing the excessive current to pass to the ground, thus protecting the devices connected to the surge protector. 2. **Gas Discharge Tubes (GDTs):** GDTs are used in some surge protectors alongside MOVs for handling very high-voltage surges, such as those from lightning strikes. They work by ionizing gas inside a tube to create a conductive path to ground for the excess voltage. # Usage of Surge-Protected Extension Cords Surge-protected extension cords are particularly useful in several scenarios: 1. **Protecting Sensitive Electronics:** Devices such as computers, TVs, gaming systems, and sound systems are sensitive to voltage spikes and can benefit greatly from the extra layer of protection that a surge protector offers. 2. **During Storms:** Lightning strikes can cause major surges in electrical power. Using surge-protected extension cords can help prevent damage to electronics during storms. 3. **Workspaces:** In workspaces with multiple devices hooked up together, such as computer labs or offices, a surge-protected extension cord can safeguard all the devices connected. 4. **Travel:** For those traveling, particularly to areas with unreliable electrical infrastructure, carrying a portable surge protector can prevent damage to laptops and other portable electronics. # Best Practices - **Do not overload** the surge protector by daisy-chaining multiple extension cords or plugging in devices that exceed its rated capacity. - **Check the clamping voltage,** which indicates the voltage level at which the surge protector will start redirecting excess electricity to the ground. Lower clamping voltages indicate better protection. - **Regularly inspect** the surge protector for damage, and be aware that after a major surge event, the MOVs may have degraded, reducing the effectiveness of the surge protector. Some models feature lights that indicate when protection is no longer assured. In conclusion, the surge protector of an extension cord functions as a crucial safeguard against potentially damaging voltage spikes, extending the lifespan of electronic devices and preventing data loss and physical damage. By understanding how they work and following best practices for their use, consumers can significantly enhance the protection of their electronic investments."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to what befits my new age. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. My set of spells are all mature spells so childish stats will affect them. Lily can opt to “steal” spells from my list that I haven’t used yet if her stats are high enough to cast them. Each caster has their own area for casting spells, and one of the goals of the caster is to build on top of her previous spells, so harmonizing following spells with previous spells or be consistent with a theme grants extra points, but marring previous spells with new ones or casting spells with no thought behind them deducts points. Keep an age tracker. By the end of the duel, I will be regressing to 6 and Lily will be aging to 16","completion":"# Age Tracker - **Sapphire's Starting Age**: 16 - **Lily's Starting Age**: 6 # Spellcasting Stats (Max Points: 100) - **Sapphire's Initial Stats**: 90 - **Lily's Initial Stats**: 60 # Stat Adjustment Formula Every time Sapphire casts a spell, she regresses, and Lily ages, impacting their stats as follows, with (n) being the number of spells Sapphire has cast: - **Sapphire's Stat Adjustment**: [ Stat = 90 - (5^n) ] - **Lily's Stat Adjustment**: [ Stat = 60 + (4^n) ] - **Childish Stat for Sapphire** (kicks in after 1st spell, with (n) being the total number of spells cast): [ Childish Stat = 2^n ] # Scenario Start The crowd gathers, the anticipation palpable as Sapphire, the teen division champion of magic dueling, steps into the enchanted dueling circle, facing off against an unlikely challenger: 6-year-old Lily. The air vibrates with imminent spells about to be woven, with each participant ready to cast their most beautiful and glamorous spells. # Sapphire's Spell List 1. Celestial Cascade 2.

However, as the spell is cast, Sapphire suddenly feels a momentary dizziness. Unknown to her, Lily had secretly cast an age-regression/aging spell, subtly shifting the power dynamics. - **Points Awarded**: Sapphire - 25/30 (influence of sudden regression) - **Points Awarded**: Lily - 22/25 # Age Shift - **Sapphire's Current Age**: Now 14 (after casting 1 spell) - **Lily's Current Age**: Now 8 (after Sapphire's 1 spell) # Stat Changes - **Sapphire's Adjusted Stats**: 85 - **Lily's Adjusted Stats**: 64 - **Sapphire's Childish Stat**: 2 As the rounds proceed, with each spell cast by Sapphire, her prowess wanes ever so slightly under the burden of regressing age and increasing childish stats, while Lily's expertise blooms. The intricate dance of spellcasting weaves a fine line between victory and the heartache of defeat, with Sapphire battling not only her formidable yet diminutive opponent but also the regression spell's cruel whimsy. # Audience Notes: - As the duel progresses, spells cast by Sapphire must contend with the dual challenge of decreasing maturity stats and increasing childish stats, rendering her brilliant spells with potential weaknesses and making every choice a delicate gamble. - Lily, on the other hand, grows stronger and more adept, her spells gaining depth and complexity, potentially even encroaching upon Sapphire's list for spells once thought beyond her age's grasp. # Objective: - To emerge victorious, Sapphire will need to skillfully select her spells, considering her diminishing capacity and the increasing challenge posed by Lily's burgeoning power.

Despite the unexpected wave of dizziness caused by Lily's hidden spell, your execution was nearly flawless, earning you 25 points out of a possible 30. The minor deduction was due to the nascent effects of age regression, which slightly muddled the clarity of your cosmic fabric. As you stand, slightly shorter, your mind races to comprehend the sudden shift. The crowd, unaware of the subtle changes, continues to cheer, their excitement palpable. Lily's Counter Lily responds with **Rainbow Ribbon**, conjuring vivid streaks of color that dance around the dueling area. Her execution is commendable, especially for her (now) 8 years, netting her 22 points. It's clear she's a prodigy, her spell weaving an intricate counterpoint to your cosmic display. Sapphire's Age and Stats after Round 1: - **Current Age**: 14 years - **Stat Adjustments**: - Spellcasting Stats are now at 85. - Childish Stat has risen to 2, which could begin to subtly hinder your more mature spell choices. # Round 2 Begins With the duel now in full swing, and the effects of Lily's secret spell becoming ever so slightly more palpable, it's time for your second spell choice. Remember, each spell you cast will further regress your age, while Lily continues to gain years and skill. Given the growing influence of the \\"Childish Stat,\\" consider strategically whether to opt for a spell that's resilient to its effects or if you're willing to press on with high complexity, risking the potential for underperformance. # Available Spells for Sapphire 1.

Colored lights akin to the auroras of the far north begin to emerge, casting an otherworldly glow across the dueling area. The aurora weaves through the remnants of the celestial cascade, combining the cosmic with the atmospheric, a testament to your attempt at harmonizing spells. However, the complexity of **Mystic Aurora**, paired with your now youthful exuberance and slightly declining spellcasting precision due to the \\"Childish Stat\\", impacts its stability. The aurora flickers unpredictably, sometimes bursting with breathtaking beauty, at other times nearly fading away. # Points for Mystic Aurora - The overall beauty and attempt at thematic continuation earn you **23 points** out of 30. The fluctuation in the aurora's intensity, caused by your slightly diminished control, has affected the score. - **Childish Stat Interaction**: The increasing influence of youthful naivety introduces a whimsical, albeit slightly uncontrolled, element to the spell, highlighting the challenge posed by regressing age. Lily's Counter: Sparkling Meadow In response, Lily, with an air of burgeoning confidence, casts **Sparkling Meadow**. The dueling area transforms into a vibrant field of flowers, each petal shimmering under an unseen sunlight. This growth-themed spell captures the imagination and delights the audience, synergizing well with her previous rainbow-themed spell and reflecting her now 10-year-old capabilities. - Lily's execution is remarkably improved from her first spell, earning her **25 points**. The spell not only captivates but also cleverly builds upon her initial choice, showcasing her growth in skill. # Post-Round 2 Changes Age and Stats - **Sapphire's Current Age**: Now **12 years old**. With every spell cast, the invisible burden of Lily's spell pulls at your essence, further regressing your age. - **Lily's Current Age**: Now **10 years old**. She grows not just in literal age but in confidence and magical prowess. - **Sapphire's Adjusted Stats**: - Spellcasting Stats: Now **80** (slight decrease due to age regression and rising Childish Stat). - Childish Stat: Rises to **4** (influencing your spell execution more noticeably). Points Update - **Sapphire**: 48 points (25 + 23 from both rounds). - **Lily**: 47 points (22 + 25 from both rounds). Despite the challenging circumstances, Sapphire, your mastery shines through. However, the competition is neck and neck, with Lily's unexpected growth adding suspense to the duel. # Ahead to Round 3 With three spells left and your age continuing to regress, the challenge intensifies.

With focused intent, she channels her energy, summoning a sprawling garden of magical flowers that bloom in radiant colors and emit a soothing, harmonious melody. The blossoms synergize with the remnants of the celestial cosmos and the flickering aurora, creating a spectacle of nature's serenity amidst the universe's vast mystery. Despite the inherent challenge posed by your \\"Childish Stat,\\" **Enchanted Blossoms** benefits from this attribute by radiating a pure, unadulterated joy and wonder that only the innocence of youth could enhance.

Давайте рассмотрим основные моменты для рефакторинга: 1. **Сокращение дублирования кода:** Уменьшить дублирование кода, особенно при переборе игроков по командам. 2. **Оптимизация логики выбора игры:** Разграничить логику отображения меню и логику выбора, чтобы упростить дальнейшие изменения. 3. **Рефакторинг методов \`Execute\`, \`Start\`, и \`End\`:** Организовать логику игры таким образом, чтобы было легко добавлять новые типы игр. Вот пример рефакторинга с использованием некоторых из этих предложений: # Оптимизация метода OnGamesCommand \`\`\`java public void OnGamesCommand(CCSPlayerController? player, CommandInfo commandInfo) { if (!IsValidInmate(player)) { player.PrintToChat(“This command is only for inmates”); return; } var inmates = GetPlayersByTeam(CsTeam.Terrorist); if (inmates.Count < 2) { player.PrintToChat(“Inmates count must be more or equal 2”); return; } DisplayGameSelectionMenu(player, _lrGames, inmates); } private bool IsValidInmate(CCSPlayerController? player) { return player != null && player.Team == CsTeam.Terrorist; } private List<CCSPlayerController> GetPlayersByTeam(CsTeam team) { return Utilities.GetPlayers().Where(player => player.Team == team).ToList(); } private void DisplayGameSelectionMenu(CCSPlayerController player, IEnumerable<LRGame> games, List<CCSPlayerController> players) { var menu = new ChatMenu(“Выберите игру”); foreach (var game in games) { menu.AddMenuOption(game.Name, (controller, option) => { GameSelected(player, game, players); }); } MenuManager.OpenChatMenu(player, menu); } \`\`\` # Оптимизация метода GameSelected Вы можете аналогично рефакторить \`GameSelected\`, отделяя логику получения списка \\"хранителей\\" и дополнительной обработки. # Заключение Мы рассмотрели базовый рефакторинг кода, который помогает упростить структуру классов и методов, делая код более читабельным и легко расширяемым.

This traditional puppetry style, which involves manipulating cloth puppets that cover the puppeteer's hands like gloves, is a profound way of storytelling that has been passed down through generations. It stands as a testament to the rich cultural and artistic tapestry of China, revealing the depth of creativity and narrative skill present in traditional Chinese art forms. The reference to a story from the \\"Water Margin,\\" also known as \\"Outlaws of the Marsh,\\" within the context of Zhangzhou glove puppetry, showcases a fascinating intersection of literature and performance art. The \\"Water Margin\\" is one of China’s Four Great Classical Novels, revered for its intricate plot and a vast ensemble of characters, each with distinct personalities and moral complexities. By choosing to render stories from such an influential piece of literature, Zhangzhou glove puppetry not only keeps the novel’s legacy alive but also offers audiences, both local and international, an engaging and accessible gateway to understanding Chinese literary classics. Incorporating elements from the \\"Water Margin,\\" specifically episodes based in Daming Prefecture—a locality frequently referenced in the novel—into puppetry performances, the puppeteers of Zhangzhou contribute to the preservation and reinterpretation of these classic tales. They breathe life into the legendary figures of the novel, using the visual and kinetic language of puppetry to explore themes of loyalty, justice, rebellion, and fate that are central to the narrative. Moreover, this artistic practice strengthens community ties and identity, offering a shared cultural touchstone that spans age and social strata. It also serves an educational purpose, as each performance becomes an opportunity to pass on knowledge and cultural values embodied in the \\"Water Margin\\" and the art of puppetry itself. The global recognition of such intangible cultural heritages under frameworks established by organizations like UNESCO has helped to highlight the significance of preserving these art forms. Efforts to document, support, and revitalize traditional practices like glove puppetry are crucial, ensuring they remain vibrant and relevant for future generations. In doing so, the stories from historical texts like the \\"Water Margin\\" continue to be told in visually compelling and culturally rich ways, bridging the past and present and fostering a deeper appreciation for China's extensive cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"do you think the sentence is natural?","completion":"The sentence you provided originally: \\"The glove puppetry, another element of intangible cultural heritage from Zhangzhou, vividly renders one of the most fascinating stories set in Daming Prefecture from the Water Margin, one of China’s most read novels.\\" is grammatically correct and understandable. However, if the goal is to make the sentence flow more naturally or enhance its clarity, especially for an audience that might not be familiar with all the elements mentioned, it could be slightly revised for improved readability. Here's an updated version: \\"Glove puppetry, a significant part of Zhangzhou's intangible cultural heritage, brings to life the captivating stories of Daming Prefecture found in 'Water Margin', one of China's most renowned novels.\\" This revision aims to streamline the information and make it slightly more accessible to readers who may not have a background in Chinese cultural heritage or literature."},{"prompt":"how about this one: Glove puppetry, another element of intangible cultural heritage from Zhangzhou, brings to life the captivating stories of Daming Prefecture from Water Margin, one of China’s most read novels.","completion":"Your revised sentence: \\"Glove puppetry, another element of intangible cultural heritage from Zhangzhou, brings to life the captivating stories of Daming Prefecture from Water Margin, one of China’s most read novels.\\" This version is indeed more natural and flows better.

The addition of \\"classic\\" before \\"novels\\" is a subtle but meaningful enhancement, adding an extra layer of respect and acknowledgement to the status of \\"Water Margin\\" in the literary world.

However, there seems to be a slight error in the reference to \\"Daguangxian\\" as the name of the instrument. There may be a confusion or a mix-up in the name of the instrument, as \\"Daguangxian\\" does not correspond to known traditional Chinese bowed string instruments commonly recognized in the context of Fujian or Taiwan. It's possible that the intended reference might be to the \\"Erhu,\\" \\"Gehu,\\" or another traditional Chinese stringed instrument. If \\"Erhu\\" was the intended instrument, here is a corrected version of the sentence: \\"This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically by the moving tune of the Erhu, a bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.\\" This corrected sentence maintains your original intent, incorporating music to enhance the artistic presentation of calligraphy, and corrects the instrument's name to one that is widely recognized."},{"prompt":"how about this one: This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically to the moving tune of Daguangxian, a bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.","completion":"Your modified sentence is: \\"This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically to the moving tune of Daguangxian, a bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.\\" This version of the sentence enhances clarity slightly by changing \\"by\\" to \\"to,\\" which may help in directly linking the calligraphy performance with the music being a backdrop or an accompaniment rather than a direct agent of artistic enhancement. However, the potential issue regarding the instrument \\"Daguangxian\\" remains as previously mentioned. It appears there might be a mix-up or incorrect naming, as \\"Daguangxian\\" is not recognized as a common traditional Chinese bowed string instrument. Ensuring the right name of the instrument could be important for accuracy and avoiding confusion for readers who might be familiar with Chinese musical instruments. Assuming you are referring to a traditional bowed string instrument, I'll provide an alternative with a known instrument for coherence: \\"This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically to the moving tune of the Erhu, a bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.\\" This revised sentence assumes the \\"Erhu\\" as the instrument, which is known for its expressive qualities and is indeed a bowed string instrument popular in various regions, including Fujian and Taiwan."},{"prompt":"how about this one: This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically to the moving tune of Daguangxian, an Erhu-like bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.","completion":"Your latest revision: \\"This calligraphy performance is rendered more artistically to the moving tune of Daguangxian, an Erhu-like bowed string instrument popular in Fujian and Taiwan.\\" This iteration efficiently addresses previous concerns by specifying that the \\"Daguangxian\\" is an Erhu-like instrument, thus providing clarity and context. It helps the reader understand that while the specific name \\"Daguangxian\\" may not be widely recognized, it can be understood as similar to the more familiar Erhu. This adjustment maintains the cultural specificity and accuracy of your sentence, making it more informative and engaging for the audience. The sentence now clearly communicates that the calligraphy performance is enhanced by the music of a traditional string instrument, known in specific regions, which adds depth to the artistic expression being described. It's a thoughtful blend of visual and musical art forms, vividly evoking the cultural richness being portrayed."},{"prompt":"how about this one: The tales of daffodils are told through the unique art form of Jin’ge, a cultural patrimony from Tang and Song Dynasties, which combines singing with storytelling.","completion":"Your sentence is well-structured and informative, offering a concise introduction to Jin'ge and its cultural significance: \\"The tales of daffodils are told through the unique art form of Jin’ge, a cultural patrimony from Tang and Song Dynasties, which combines singing with storytelling.\\" Here are a few minor suggestions to refine clarity and enhance flow: 1. **Clarification of \\"tales of daffodils\\":** Unless specifically addressing known stories or legends about daffodils that the audience can immediately recognize, a brief qualifier might enrich the context. For instance, if \\"tales of daffodils\\" metaphorically represents specific themes or stories, it could be beneficial to slightly expand on that. 2. **Elaboration on Jin'ge's significance:** While the sentence effectively communicates that Jin'ge is a distinct art form involving singing and storytelling from the Tang and Song dynasties, a brief mention of why it’s significant or what makes it unique could enhance reader interest. For example, noting its role in historical narrative preservation or its influence on later art forms could provide more depth. 3. **Cultural Patrimony:** The term \\"cultural patrimony\\" aptly indicates Jin'ge’s importance but could be slightly rephrased for clarity or emphasis on heritage, especially for readers less familiar with the term. With these considerations in mind, a revised version might look like this: \\"Through the unique art form of Jin'ge—a treasured heritage of the Tang and Song Dynasties, which artfully combines singing with storytelling—the enchanting tales of daffodils come to life, revealing deep cultural narratives.\\" This version aims to maintain your original meaning while adding a touch of specificity and context, enhancing the overall impact of the sentence."},{"prompt":"how about this one: The tales of daffodils are told with artful delicacy through Jin’ge, a unique art form of narrative sing and a treasured cultural patrimony from the Tang and Song Dynasties.","completion":"Your revised sentence is beautifully crafted and effectively conveys the essence of the art form while also emphasizing its cultural significance: \\"The tales of daffodils are told with artful delicacy through Jin’ge, a unique art form of narrative sing and a treasured cultural patrimony from the Tang and Song Dynasties.\\" It smoothly integrates a more vivid description (\\"artful delicacy\\") and slightly adjusts the wording for clarity and elegance (\\"narrative sing\\" to possibly \\"narrative singing\\"). Here’s a minor suggestion to further refine the sentence, ensuring clarity around \\"narrative singing\\": \\"The tales of daffodils are told with artful delicacy through Jin’ge, a unique art form of narrative singing and a treasured cultural patrimony from the Tang and Song Dynasties.\\" By modifying \\"narrative sing\\" to \\"narrative singing,\\" the sentence becomes immediately clear to readers, ensuring that Jin'ge's storytelling aspect through song is fully understood.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily’s increase and connect part of the formula to what befits my new age. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give us a list of 20 spells (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them.

Let's create a simple Python GUI application using Tkinter with a main menu and a sub-menu. In this example, we will create a window with a main menu that includes two items: 'File' and 'Edit'. Under 'File', there will be two sub-menu items 'New' and 'Exit'. And under 'Edit', we will add 'Cut' and 'Copy' sub-menu items. Each menu item will perform a simple action when selected. \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk from tkinter import messagebox def new_file(): messagebox.showinfo(\\"New File\\", \\"You have selected New File.\\") def exit_app(): window.quit() def cut_text(): messagebox.showinfo(\\"Cut\\", \\"You have selected Cut.\\") def copy_text(): messagebox.showinfo(\\"Copy\\", \\"You have selected Copy.\\") window = tk.Tk() window.title(\\"Menu Example\\") # Creating a menu bar menu_bar = tk.Menu(window) # Creating the 'File' menu file_menu = tk.Menu(menu_bar, tearoff=0) file_menu.add_command(label=\\"New\\", command=new_file) file_menu.add_separator() file_menu.add_command(label=\\"Exit\\", command=exit_app) menu_bar.add_cascade(label=\\"File\\", menu=file_menu) # Creating the 'Edit' menu edit_menu = tk.Menu(menu_bar, tearoff=0) edit_menu.add_command(label=\\"Cut\\", command=cut_text) edit_menu.add_command(label=\\"Copy\\", command=copy_text) menu_bar.add_cascade(label=\\"Edit\\", menu=edit_menu) # Display the menu window.config(menu=menu_bar) window.mainloop() \`\`\` # Explanation 1. **Tkinter Import and Functions**: We start by importing the \`tkinter\` module. We also define functions (\`new_file\`, \`exit_app\`, \`cut_text\`, and \`copy_text\`) that will be called when the respective menu items are selected. They trigger simple message boxes using \`messagebox.showinfo()\` to demonstrate functionality. 2. **Window Setup**: We create a Tkinter window (\`window\`) and set its title to \\"Menu Example\\". 3. **Menu Bar**: A menu bar (\`menu_bar\`) is created by instantiating \`tk.Menu\`. It will contain all of our menu items. 4. **File Menu**: We create a \`file_menu\`, specifying \`menu_bar\` as its parent and \`tearoff=0\` to prevent it from being separated from the window. We add commands like 'New' and 'Exit' using \`file_menu.add_command()\`. A separator is added for visual distinction. The menu is added to the \`menu_bar\` using \`add_cascade()\`. 5. **Edit Menu**: Similarly, an \`edit_menu\` is created with 'Cut' and 'Copy' commands. This menu is also added to the \`menu_bar\`. 6. **Configuring the Window**: We configure the window to use our \`menu_bar\` as its menu. 7. **Mainloop**: We call \`window.mainloop()\` to keep the window displaying. Run this code in your Python environment. You will get a simple GUI application with a main menu, sub-menus, and dialog messages when the menu items are selected."},{"prompt":"explain N plus one problem in simple words","completion":"Imagine you go to a library to find a book series you love. First, you ask the librarian for a list of all the titles in the series (that's the \\"N\\" in \\"N plus one\\"). The librarian gives you a list, but to know what each book is about, you have to go back to the librarian and ask about each book individually. So, if there are 5 books, you first ask once for the list, and then 5 more times to learn about each book - making it 6 trips in total. That's the \\"plus one\\" - the initial query to get the list. In the context of programming, specifically with databases, the N+1 problem happens when your code makes one query to get a list of things (like the titles of our books) and then makes an additional query for each item on that list to get more details (like asking about each book). This means if you have N items, you end up making N+1 queries. It's inefficient because it requires a lot of back and forth communication with the database, slowing down your application and increasing the load on the database server."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Each of these classes provides specific functionality that contributes to the animated background effect, and their instances are created and managed within the lifecycle methods of the \`Header\` component. 2. **ComponentDidMount Method:** Within the \`componentDidMount\` method of the \`Header\` component, the initialization code is called. This includes setting up the canvas context, dimensions, and initializing entities (stars, shooting stars, terrains) to be animated. 3. **Entities Initialization:** The entities (an array of instances of the classes we defined) are initialized in the \`initializeEntities\` helper method called from \`componentDidMount\`. 4. **Animation Loop:** The \`animate\` method of the \`Header\` component is responsible for continuously updating and drawing each entity on the canvas to create the animation effect.

Show me the actual code corrections to make","completion":"I see a couple of issues in your script, primarily in the animation loop that causes it not to animate or show any entities. Let's address these with corrections and improvements: 1. **Animation Loop Decrement Issue**: You are not decrementing \`entLen\` in your animation loop, which will cause an infinite loop and likely not reach the entity update calls due to it becoming an infinite loop causing a script to hang or crash before any drawing is done. 2. **Index Out of Bounds**: Accessing \`this.entities[entLen]\` without decrementing will cause an \\"index out of bounds\\" error because arrays are zero-indexed in JavaScript. You should start from \`entLen - 1\`. 3. **Entity Color and Drawing Setup**: It's important to set colors and other properties correctly before drawing. Ensure your entities are using \`bgCtx\` properly for drawing and consistency in color and line properties. Let's correct these primary issues: # Corrected \`animate\` Method \`\`\`javascript animate = () => { const bgCtx = this.bgCtx; const width = this.width; const height = this.height; bgCtx.fillStyle = '#110E19'; bgCtx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height); bgCtx.fillStyle = '#ffffff'; bgCtx.strokeStyle = '#ffffff'; let entLen = this.entities.length; // Correction here: Iterate in reverse and ensure iteration starts from the last item while (entLen--) { this.entities[entLen].update(); } window.requestAnimationFrame(this.animate); // Correction to use window.requestAnimationFrame } \`\`\` # Initial Canvas Setup in \`render\` Method Ensure your \`render\` method correctly initializes the canvas to occupy the full window or the desired space correctly. # Check Creation of Terrain Canvas You are creating a new canvas for each Terrain but never drawing it onto the main canvas (\`bgCanvas\`). It looks like each terrain wants to draw onto the main canvas \`bgCtx\`, but you're creating a separate canvas context that's not used. Reuse the passed \`bgCtx\` directly for drawing in entities if you intended to draw on the main canvas. # General Advice for Debugging - **Logging**: Add \`console.log\` statements inside your \`update\` methods to ensure they're being called. - **Temporary Solid Colors**: Temporarily set solid colors for each entity type when they're drawn to visually confirm they're rendering. - **Development Tools**: Use browser developer tools to inspect the canvas and debug JavaScript. If after these corrections, you're still facing issues, it would be helpful to also validate: - Your entities (\`Star\`, \`ShootingStar\`, and \`Terrain\`) correctly receive \`bgCtx\` and utilize it for drawing. - Any transformation (like translation or scaling) applied on \`bgCtx\` is appropriately managed. Given the complexity of your animation, step-by-step debugging will be essential. Start with confirming that basic drawing operations work (e.g., manually drawing a simple rectangle or circle in \`animate\`) before moving onto more complex entity rendering."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Sobre el Chip cerebral: ‘Un dispositivo implantado en el cortex cerebral que permite que muevas el raton del ordenador con la mente?’ Cosas como estas parecen estar sacadas de una pelicula de terror. Al pensar en ello, recuerdo las historias, que solo eran historias sacadas de una pelicula futurista cuando era nina. Ahora, esto se esta convirtiendo en realidad. Hoy, la tecnologia ha avanzado miles de veces mas rapido que hace 10 anos, pero tener la posibilidad de que te implanten un dispositivo en el cerebro es aterrador. Su creador, afirma que este dispositivo ha sido creado con la intencion de ayudar a personas con movilidad reducida. Ahora, sus ventajas se han actualizado, las cito textualmente: leer la actividad cerebral de una persona, puede transmitir órdenes para restaurar funciones cerebrales dañadas, y habilitar el control de un móvil o un ordenador con el pensamiento. He aqui el problema, este dispositivo habilitara el control del movil, pudiendo en un futuro evolucionar hasta proyectar anuncios en nuestro cerebro. Si pensamos que repercusiones tendra este tipo de tecnologia a nivel psicologico, no tendria ni para comenzar. El movil, ha sido disenado con la funcion principal de facilitar las comunicaciones humanas, lo que mas tarde se ha derivado a un medio de monetizacion. Esta monetizacion son las personas. Porque digo esto? Durante mi experiencia durante 4 anos en Googl(...), fui testigo de su funcionamiento. Recuerdo que durante el ultimo ano senti que estaba trabajando para una empresa de trafico de personas. Mediante una campana publicitaria, los anunciantes empresas crean anuncios, estos anuncios tienen una configuracion especifica para llegar a un publico que pueda estar mas o menos interesado en el producto o servicio que se este vendiendo. Para que este anuncio llegue al publico que debe llegar, se configuran filtros en la campana, tales como: genero, rango de edad, palabras clave que las personas han utilizado en sus busquedas, ingresos, si son una familia o no, si esta persona ha visitado tu pagina recientemente, etc. Todos estos datos se guardan en sus bases de datos, debido a que cuando realizamos las busquedas, esta informacion se guarda con las cookies, y nos dan una ID, que es nuestro usuario en la red. Bien, una vez que la campana se ha configurado, el anuncio va ha salir en tu pantalla. Al mostrarse este anuncio, el anunciante ya esta monetizando, lo que se llamaria impresion. O 2 bien el anunciante puede monetizar si clicas en el anuncio. Fuera como fuese, Googl(...), Instag(...), Fab(...), Tik(...) y demas utilizan el mismo formato. Que se traduce en: cuantos mas anuncios veas, mas monetizan las empresas, o cuantos mas videos veas, o (...) y suma y sigue. Esto no es una sorpresa, ya que tenemos grandes documentales que nos hablan de ello. Estas plataformas, han sido disenadas por ingenieros y ejecutivos para monetizar, su interes no son que nosotros disfrutemos, o la motivacion de la cultura, o el intercambio de opiniones. La intencion de estas empresas es crear una adiccion y ellos generar mas ingresos. Para ello, todas estas empresas tienen equipos que hacen el producto mas atractivo para el consumidor, y los ingenieros lo llevan a cabo. Tambien, los diferentes partidos politicos o movimientos politicos utilizan estos medios para impulsar sus campanas, por lo que las redes sociales no son un juguete, sino que son un instrumento muy poderoso. Dicho esto, volvamos al tema del dispositivo implantado en el cerebro. Si actualmente las redes sociales tienen implicaciones psicologicas negativas en la sociedad, y son altamente peligrosas en cuestiones politicas, imaginemos por un momento la repercusion que tendria si en vez de tener todos estos estimulos en un telefono movil, que podemos dejar en nuestro bolsillo, permanentemente en nuestro cerebro. De manera que es casi imposible desconectarnos. Aqui viene el poder de la voluntad. Este dispositivo, que aun se encuentra en panales, podria evolucionar a funcionar como un telefono movil en nuestros cerebros, estando conectados a internet 24/7, estando expuestos a anuncios constantemente, a videos de inst(....) sin ningun tipo de valor, a videos de tik(...) absurdos, a mensajes politicos con intereses de cada una de los diferentes partidos o movimientos. Pero, que pasaria si esto se pudiese hackear? Imaginemos por un momento que vivimos en una sociedad en la que gran parte de la sociedad tiene este dispositivo implantado, y un grupo minoritario hackea este dispositivo para conseguir algo en particular. Digamos que su proposito es crear un conflicto, entonces estos hackers bombardearian a la sociedad con videos o noticias relacionadas con este conflicto, que no seria una verdad absoluta, sino una forma de manipulacion. Esto ya esta sucediendo con las redes sociales, pero es mas facil desconectar cuando no es un dispositivo pegado a nuestro cuerpo. Seamos un poco menos catastrofistas, y volvamos a hechos factibles. 3 2.) Sobre las relaciones sociales: Yo naci en 1991, por aquella epoca, los telefonos moviles ya existian (sin conexion a internet), por lo que eran una tecnologia enfocada a facilitar las comunicaciones en movimiento. Internet tambien existia, puedo decir que no mucha gente de mi alrededor tenia ordenador en casa e internet, pero en mi caso si. Por aquel tiempo Googl(...) ya existia, pero estaba todabia gateando. Recuerdo insertar www. con cosas y terminar por .es o .com para ver si encontraba paginas, y que habia en esas paginas. Los telefonos no tenian internet, las redes sociales no existian, mi crianza ha estado totalmente desconectada de este tipo de estimulos artificiales. Jugabamos en el parque, nos subiamos a los arboles, hablabamos de videojuegos (ya que obviamente existian las consolas), jugabamos y jugabamos. Mi circulo no empezo a tener Fac(...) hasta que no cumpli los 17 anos, que utilizabamos para jugar al poker. Luego comenzaron a habilitar subir imagenes, etiquetar, etc. Era como un album de fotos que permitia guardar las imagenes durante anos en una plataforma online. Despues, alla por el 2012, cuando tenia 21 anos, Inst(...) empezo a ser popular. No tanto como en estos dias, pero la gente empezo a conocerlo. En aquellos dias podias tener 1 like como que ninguno. Lo importante era que podias subir imagenes y se convertia en un album online, por lo que no importaba si perdidas las imagenes fisicas, o de la memoria de tu ordenador, estas imagenes online siempre iban a estar ahi y nunca se perderán. Todavia en ese tiempo, las relaciones sociales eran mas cercanas, la gente no estaba constantemente con el telefono en la mano. Wasa(...) no existia, por lo que los mensajes de texto costaban dinero, y nos inventamos un idioma para sms acortado para intentar pagar lo menos posible por mensaje. Los mensajes eran concisos y claros, nada que no fuera importante, ya que nuestro bolsillo dependia de ello. Ahora, al caminar por la calle, ir en el metro, observar a un padre conduciendo con su hijo, podemos ver que absolutamente todo el mundo con su telefono movil. Cenas de padres con sus hijos y los hijos con los telefonos, madres concudiendo y los hijos absorbidos con los telefonos moviles, y la lista suma y sigue. 4 Las conversaciones muchas veces se sustituyen por estos estimulos que salen de nuestros dispositivos moviles, y es tan facil como dejar el movil en nuestro bolsillo o en nuestro bolso. Bien, que pasaria con el dispositivo cerebral? Imagino estas cenas en las que las personas estan con la mirada perdida, totalmente conectados a la red, sin entablar ningun tipo de conversacion, y si alguna, esta estar relacionada con lo que estan viendo en sus cabezas. Podemos ver algo parecido en una pelicula apocaliptica, no recuerdo el nombre, pero es un adolescente jugando a un videojuego en su mente, sentado a la mesa cenando con su padre, y el padre por mucho que intenta pedirle que pare, le resulta casi imposible. Actualmente, las redes sociales estan aqui, y han sido creadas para quedarse. Es una tecnologia que no va a desaparecer, y tampoco es mi intencion convencerte de dejar de utilizarla, sino mostrarte un punto de vista diferente. 5 3.) Sobre el consumismo: Sabemos que las redes sociales son una tecnologia altamente adictiva, utilizada por muchos como una manera de darse a conocer, dar a conocer sus pequenas y medianas empresas, o sus pensamientos, su arte, sus clases de Yoga, etc. Es una herramienta como tantas otras hubo antes de las redes sociales. El dilema aqui es que las grandes empresas y los poderosos quieren crear adictos para generar dinero sin ningun tipo de regulacion legal. Pongamos un ejemplo practico: Tenemos ninas de 10 anos, viendo videos de cremas, estos videos se realizan de manera que atraigan a este tipo de sector (ya que todavia no son consumidores activos), y para ello publicitan la crema por terceros (usuarios de instagram o influencers), con fondos y colores rosas, y musica para este sector. El algoritmo de estas redes sociales interpreta que este usuario en particular le gustan los videos de cremas. Bien, esta red social mostrara este tipo de videos enfocados para ninos de cremas. El tema de esto es el tipo de repercusion a largo plazo que tendra en la mente de esta nina. Viendo videos de cremas sin parar. Podria crearse ya a esta temprana edad un comportamiento consumista, que no necesariamente se desarrolle a tan temprana edad, sino cuando sea una persona madura. Esta nina, cuando sea adulta y forme parte del sistema economico, tendera a consumir mas este tipo de productos, porque es a lo que ha estado expuesta cuando era nina. En conclusion, podemos decir que las redes sociales puedan no afectarnos a las generaciones de antes del 2000, porque no hemos estado expuestos a ellas. Pero para las generaciones post 2000, son un experimento capitalista. Dentro de 20 anos estas grandes empresas veran resultados y seran mas millonarias de lo que lo han sido nunca. Si esa generacion ha estado expuesta a este tipo de anuncios, porque son lo que son, anuncios, imaginemos que tuviesen un dispositivo instalado en el cerebro, seria inimaginable. Por otro lado, pensemos en la television. Durante los 90, los canales de dibujos animados tenian prohibido mostrar anuncios publicitarios a menores de edad, ya que no se debe exponer a los ninos a estimulos consumistas. 6 Entonces, que pasa con las redes sociales? Estos anuncios, por ejemplo de cremas que pueden ser utilizadas por ninos, no son directamente publicitadas por las empresas per se. Porque? Por que las empresas son muy inteligentes, ellos no van a publicitar directamente estos anuncios a ninos, porque no pueden. Como comente, yo trabajaba en Googl(...), y ningun tipo de anuncio podia filtrarse a ninos, aunque si en algunos casos a adolescentes, teniendo grandes restricciones para estos ultimos. Entonces, estas marcas utilizan terceros para promocionar sus productos a ninos. Como lo hacen? A traves de estos’ influencers’ o usuarios que desean ser influencers. Las empresas pagan X a estos usuarios por promocionar sus productos (con unas condiciones particulares), estos particulares muestran en sus videos estos productos, y al ser videos y no campanas publicitarias, no tienen restricciones de edad, ni restricciones de formato, por lo que este producto puede llegar a un publico de cualquier edad. Suena peligroso verdad? Puede pensarse que es una exageracion, pero pensemos en otro ejemplo: Si en nuestro circulo cercano, tenemos personas a las que les gusta la musica rock, y constantemente estan poniendo musica rock, y al salir vamos a bares en donde ponen musica rock, despues de cierto tiempo nosotros nos convertiremos en fans del rock. Tiene sentido verdad? El consumismo tiene el mismo proposito. Si las redes sociales, que concienzudamente tienen su algoritmo furncionando a la perfección para mostrarnos videos y videos de productos cosmeticos, al final crearan una inclinacion por los productos cosmeticos, y cuando seamos adultos, seremos mas consumidores de productos cosmeticos. Esto tiene la base cientifica de que somos imitadores, al igual que nuestros antepasados los simios. Vemos y reproducimos, y las empresas lo saben perfectamente. 7 4.) Sobre la economia Al principio del libro, nos hemos enfocado al dispositivo cerebral. Pero dejemos los delirios para mas tarde y centremonos en la actualidad. Las redes sociales han sido creadas para monetizar, como cualquier otra empresa. Pero probablemente algunas de ellas fuesen creadas con ideas mas eticas, inovadoras y experimentales. Una vez que estas redes sociales se hicieron populares, y sus creadores llegaron a monetizar, empresas y particulares de todos los rincones del mundo comenzaron a prestar mas atencion a estos nuevos canales de comunicacion. Estas empresas o particulares, probablemente se convirtieron en activos muy importantes de todas estas redes sociales, ayudando con sus inversiones, a cambio de (...). A cambio de que? Quien podrian ser estas empresas y particulares, y cuales son sus intereses en hacer que estas redes sociales se hagan imprescindibles para la sociedad? Que podria querer una multinacional de nosotros? La respuesta es obvia, consumidores, pero no solo consumidores, sino consumidores adictos. Luego, quienes son estos particulares? Como hemos dicho, podrian ser partidos politicos, generando contenido caotico sobre cada una de las partes y dividir la opinion publica. O podrian ser movimientos revolucionarios que se publicitan inocentemente con la premisa de tambien generar caos y pudiendo esto generar guerras, racismo, division social, etc. Tambien podrian ser personas poderosas, que atenten contra nuestra sociedad. Porque digo esto? Vamos a verlo desde un punto de vista socio economico. Nuestro sistema es un sistema capitalista, que fue creado por Adam Smith alla por 1723. Este sistema capitalista lleva tiempo fallando, y hace tiempo que estos particulares poderosos lo saben. Cuando estudiaba bachillerato cientifico, conoci a un profesor llamado Alfonso Llebenes, este profesor de Geologia, tambien profesor de la universidad de Alicante, procedia de una familia aristocratica de Madrid, habiendo escapado a edad temprana a viajar por todo el mundo. Comenzo a estudiar en la universidad la carrera de Geologia, y comenzo a trabajar para una de las primeras Petroleras de Estados Unidos, una de las mas importantes del mundo. 8 Moviendose en estos circulos, escucho historias sobre estas realidades capitalistas. Un dia nos conto la historia de que la integracion de la mujer al mercado laboral en 1978, no fue mas que una maniobra de los gobiernos para el consumismo. Porque? Porque por aquellos tiempos, Europa algunos anos atras habia pasado por una Guerra Mundial, Espana paso por una guerra civil, y ademas de esto, toda Europa sufrio la fiebre espanola. Estas guerras hicieron que el indice de natalidad cayese en picado, junto con la poblacion masculina. En este caso, los gobiernos y poderosos del mundo probablemente observasen la integracion de la mujer al mundo laboral como una alternativa para impulsar el continuo crecimiento de la economia de los paises. Luego, es famoso, que la mujer por naturaleza es mas consumista que un hombre, por lo menos en aquellos tiempos. Porque? Por que la mujer siempre ha teniendo una mayor conciencia de lo que hace falta en su casa y para su familia: comida, ropa, zapatos, objectos del hogar, etc. Esto fue concienzudamente estudiado, debido a que si una mujer se incorporaba al mercado laboral, ya no dependeria del hombre para realizar las compras, sino que poseerá su propio dinero para comprar a su antojo. Ahora bien, este sistema Capitalista que tenemos ahora, ha evolucionado gracias a las redes sociales. Las redes sociales han evolucionado para incrementar las compras, y lo estan consiguiendo. Sin embargo, estas redes sociales estan creando consumidores adictos, que es principalmente lo que cualquier empresa quiere. Por ejemplo: Si tenemos un restaurante, obviamente queremos que nuestro restaurante este siempre lleno de clientes, ya que de esta manera pagaremos los costes de nuestro negocio y ademas crearemos ganacias. Pero un restaurante, por mucho que publicite en redes sociales, tiene la limitacion del aforo, por lo que por mucho que invierta en publicidad en las redes sociales, no va a poder hacerse millonario, y probablemente no es el mejor tipo de negocio para crear adictos consumidores. Sin embargo, una marca por ejemplo de cosmeticos, puede realizar sus ventas online, con lo que a mayor inversión realicen en este tipo de publicidad, mayor seran las ganancias. Con este pensamiento, es obvio que las empresas quieren consumidores adictos para enriquecerse. El planteamiento en si no es falto de moral, pero si tiene unas implicaciones sociales que puedan cambiar los patrones y comportamientos de la sociedad a largo plazo, especialmente en edades tempranas. 9 5.) Sobre las implicaciones psicologicas El uso de las redes sociales puede tener implicaciones psicologicas. Estas implicaciones vendran determinadas por diferentes factores, como si por ejemplo ya tenemos un cuadro de enfermedades mentales, o cuadros por depresion, autoestima baja, etc. Sea como fuere, ya hemos hablado sobre las relaciones sociales en capitulos anteriores. Enfocandonos a un uso prolongado y excesivo de las redes sociales, obtenemos un tipo de relaciones sociales online, que no son fisicas. El tipo de lenguaje y mensaje que recibimos y transmitimos no seria el mismo que si tuviesemos a la persona delante, y tampoco probablemente la conversacion seria sobre el mismo tema. Este exceso puede crear un aislamiento social, que la persona pueda pensar que es muy sociable en ese mundo online, pero despues puede tener problemas a la hora de relacionarse en el mundo real, incluso problemas de comunicacion. Otra implicacion psicologica seria el autoestima. Las redes sociales son un canal en el que muchas personas expresan su opinion sin ningun tipo de filtro, y muchas veces, al hacerlo desde un canal que es online, muchas veces pecamos de ser demasiado criticos, incluso en muchas ocasiones crueles. Se podria decir que las redes sociales pueden llegar a crear un deficit de empatia? Digo esto porque esta a la orden del dia abrir un post, y al revisar los mensajes de los usuarios, a veces encontrarnos con mensajes un poco desproporcionados e hirientes. Al las redes sociales crear este deficit de empatia hacia la persona a la que estamos comentando, esto puede crear problemas de autoestima en las personas que han generado el post. Ya sea porque la persona ya tenia un autoestima bajo de antemano, o bien porque hoy en dia, generaciones cada vez mas jovenes utilizan las redes sociales y sus cerebros todavia no son lo suficientemente maduros como encajar criticas tan fuertes, que muchas veces proceden de adolescentes como ellos, pero en su gran mayoria proceden de adultos con este deficid de empatia. Estas criticas afectan negativamente a la persona, pudiendo tener consecuencias negativas y en algunos extremos hasta catastroficas. Cuando esto sucede a ninos o adolescentes, las consecuencias de esto no se pueden medir a corto plazo, y pueden ser un desencadenante importante en su crecimiento y desarrollo a nivel psicologico. Por otro lado, tambien tendriamos como ejemplo los filtros, estos filtros de belleza tan conocidos por todos los usuarios. Estos filtros, afectan negativamente en la perpercion que las personas tienen de ellas mismas. Pudiendo generar un problema sobre la realidad del paso del tiempo, o sobre la realidad de su ser. 10 Imaginemos aquellas epocas en las que no existian los espejos. Las personas tenian una concepcion de ellos mismos vista desde los ojos de los demas, por lo que para tener conciencia del fisico de uno mismo, se recaia en la empatia y en lo que las demas personas te transmitian sobre tu fisico. Tambien recurrian a los dibujos y las pinturas, que estas mas bien reflejaban una idea aproximada del fisico de la persona, no obsesionandose nunca con el parecer. Luego se invento la fotografia, esta reflejaba mas fielmente el fisico de la persona, pero por aquellos tiempos no se hacian tanta cantidad de fotografias como ahora, y estas fotografias al tener que imprimirse eran costosas. Ahora con la facilidad de hacer fotografias con los telefonos moviles, la posibilidad de subir estas fotografias a las redes sociales sin ningun coste, ha impulsado esta vertiente, derivando en como hacer las fotos mas atractivas para el publico, y aqui vienen los filtros. Esta es mi sincera opinion, que no es una verdad absoluta, pero pienso que desde que las redes sociales existen, ha aumentado la exposicion del Yo, y nuestra exposicion del Yo al mundo tiene obviamente implicaciones. Estas implicaciones como hemos comentado pueden ser la critica, pero tambien pueden ser comentarios positivos. Estos comentarios positivos son estimulantes, y nos empujan a publicar mas fotografias de nosotros mismos, en busca de esos estimulos positivos. Pero, que sucede cuando encontramos entre los comentarios criticas negativas? Como funciona nuestro cerebro ante esas criticas? Si nuestro cerebro esta lo suficientemente desarrollado, y tenemos un autoestima indestructible, estas criticas no nos afectaran negativamente. Pero si por el contrario, somos personas sensibles, o con autoestima baja, o bien somos personas jovenes y nuestro cerebro todavia se esta desarrollando socialmente, entonces esas criticas nos afectaran psicologicamente de una manera negativa. La accion de subir fotografias de nosotros mismos se realiza inconscientemente para recibir un estimulo positivo, este estimulo genera a nuestro cerebro una sensacion de placer, de recompensa. Al recibir un estimulo negativo, puede generar debilidad emocional, complejos sobre uno mismo. Si tenemos una nariz muy grande, haremos lo posible para que la imagen no muestre que tenemos una nariz grande, o si tenemos sobre peso, sacaremos fotografias que no muestren nuestro cuerpo, y si lo hacen, estaremos en una postura que nos haga mas delgadas. Y ahi es donde entran los filtros. Estos filtros distorsionan la realidad, estos filtros generan mayor cantidad de comentarios positivos porque no muestran una realidad, por lo tanto mayor cantidad de estimulos positivos para nuestro cerebro. 11 Pudiendo crear un rechazo hacia nuestra persona, ya que en la vida real no llevamos estos filtros puestos. No somos capaces de mirarnos al espejo, y si lo hacemos creamos una obsesion hacia nuestro fisico, al que ya hemos generado una lista de complejos. Esto se puede derivar tanto por el fisico, como para las facciones faciales, como para la edad. Hoy en dia, estos filtros estan generando un alto indice de depresiones en mujeres debido a la obsesion con la edad. Estos filtros consiguen rejuvenecernos en las fotografias, luego viendonos en un espejo, la realidad es muy diferente. Por lo que tambien tiene implicaciones psicologicas en rangos de edad mas maduros. Desde este enfoque, las redes sociales estan generando indirectamente un miedo al paso del tiempo, que es la ley de vida. Ahora no se envejece orgullosamente, sino que el envejecer es un sintoma de debilidad, algo de lo que avergonzarse. Volviendo al consumismo, esto les viene muy bien a las empresas de cirujia estetica, con lo que no quiero criticar a las personas que deciden utilizar estos servicios, sino anadirlo como una empresa mas de servicios que se beneficia de los cambios sociales y psicologicos que las redes sociales estan ocasionando en la sociedad. Todas estas implicaciones psicologicas y muchas mas, no pueden ser revisadas en lo que a la legalidad concierne. Porque? Por que las redes sociales estan fuera de control, es un motor tan absurdamente grande y extenso, que no puede filtrar el contenido o las opiniones de los usuarios respecto a los post dependiendo de tu edad, tu estado de animo o psicologico. 12 6.) Sobre los habitos del sueno Hoy en dia, los telefonos moviles se han convertido en una extension de nuestro cuerpo, es por ello que nunca nos despegamos de ellos. Esto puede afectar negativamente si ademas de utilizar las redes sociales continuamente durante el dia, tambien lo hacemos durante la noche, cuando nos encontramos en nuestra cama. Es habitual tumbarnos en la cama cuando llega la noche, y revisar nuestras redes sociales como excusa de que es nuestro momento de paz y desconexion, ya sea para un estudiante universitario, una madre, un trabajador de la obra, o quien sea. Es en este momento de paz cuando abrimos nuestras redes sociales para navegar entre videos y publicaciones. Que es lo que sucede aqui? Que este momento de paz en nuestro dormitorio se esta viendo afectado por un estimulo cognitivo y una pantalla brillante. Ese momento de paz en que queremos relajarnos para finalmente dormir y descansar, se convierte en horas de navegar entre videos y publicaciones que mantienen a nuestro cerebro alerta en vez de relajarnos. Al nuestro cerebro estar en un momento cognitivo alterado, es muy posible que al desconectarnos del movil, no consigamos conciliar el sueno, y muchas veces esto puede ocasionar insomnio o mala calidad del sueno, que en muchas ocasiones las personas solucionamos con una visita al medico para que nos receten pastillas para dormir, pensando que puede deberse a estres por el trabajo, los ninos, los estudios, etc. Sin tener en consideracion, que esto puede estar relacionado con el echo de estar estimulando al cerebro antes de dormir. Actualmente existen numerosos estudios sobre la calidad del sueno en individuos que utilizan las redes sociales antes de irse a dormir, y se ha demostrado que puede influir en la calidad del sueno, generando que al dia siguiente se este mas cansado, ya que al nuestro cerebro estar alerta debido a este estimulo cognitivo, es mas dificil para nuestro cerebro llegar a la fase REM. El dilema de este tema vuelve a ser los habitos de uso, el aprender a utilizar las redes sociales de una manera inteligente y sana para nuestro cuerpo y nuestra salud, ya que la deficiencia en la calidad el sueno tiene tambien implicaciones no solamente fisicas a nivel de cansancio, sino tambien en nuestra salud, ya que nuestro cuerpo necesita un sueno de calidad para que nuestros diferentes organos realicen las funciones necesarias durante las horas de sueno. 13 7.) Sobre las relaciones familiares Es un echo que dinamica de las familias ha estado siempre en continua evolucion. Tampoco vamos a culpar a las redes sociales de ese momento ‘cena’ en el que en vez de tener conversaciones cada uno esta mirando sus telefonos moviles, porque esta dinamica ya existia con los televisores. Que es lo que ha cambiado entonces? El sentimiento de unidad. Antiguamente las familias se sentaban a la mesa ha hablar de su dia a dia, despues los televisores se instalaron en nuestros hogares, y las conversaciones durante las cenas y las comidas se sustituyeron por ver las noticias juntos, o una pelicula. Ahora, en vez de toda la familia compartir ese momento de unidad en el que toda la familia conversa o ven la misma pelicula, se traslada a que cada individuo de la unidad familiar tenga el foco de atencion en algo diferente: Pudiendo ser que los hijos esten viendo su serie favorita en las tablets, y los adultos esten viendo la television. O bien, que los adultos esten conversando mientras los ninos estan con las tables. O bien que los padres esten cada uno con sus telefonos moviles, y tengan hijos adolescentes y estos esten tambien con sus redes sociales. Una vez que hemos implementando esto en nuestra rutina diaria de cenas y comidas, lo hemos implementado tambien en viajes en coche, viajes en avion, tren, largas esperas, etc. No sere la unica que caminando por la calle ve a un padre y su hijo adolescente en el coche, y mientras el padre conduce el hijo tiene la pantalla del movil casi pegada a la cara, sin ver a ninguno de los dos hacer ningun gesto con la boca que haga interpretar que estan teniendo una conversacion. O parejas que se encuentran en una cena, y ambos en silencio con sus telefonos moviles. O amigos que se encuentran viajando teniendo que esperar al autobus, avion, etc, y que en vez de estar teniendo conversaciones, ambos estan inmersos en sus telefonos moviles. Todas estas situaciones podemos verlas en nuestro dia a dia, pudiendo llegar a pensar que cada dia estamos reduciendo mas las relaciones humanas, al reducir la comunicacion fisica y incrementar la comunicacion online. Estas relaciones humanas son fisicamente presentes, pero emocionalmente ausentes, ya que se puede decir que estamos juntos como una unidad, pero emocionalmente no nos estamos aportando ningun valor. No hay un estimulo entre las personas, o mas bien, este estimulo cognitivo procedente de nuestros telefonos moviles, ha ganado la batalla al estimulo cognitivo emocional de las personas que estan a nuestro alrededor. Esto, tambien puede tener implicaciones psicologicas negativas, ademas de estar cambiando los modelos de la sociedad sobre como se relacionan entre si. 14 Por ejemplo: Soy una estudiante adolescente, mi cerebro todavia se esta desarrollando, y los estimulos verbales son obviamente muy importantes para mi desarrollo. Ademas de la atencion, a esta edad, muchas veces los adolescentes queremos ser escuchados con nuestros nuevos descubrimientos sobre la cultura, o el tema que sea. Estoy con mis padres, y estos estan constantemente utilizando las redes sociales. Durante nuestro contacto, cuento orgullosamente algo que he descubierto cuando estaba estudiando, algo que para mi es muy importante comentarlo, y al contarlo y mostrar lo que he aprendido, mi cerebro espera un reconocimiento que sea estimulante para mi cerebro y me genere una sensacion de reconocimiento, o una aportacion al tema comentado que sea un aliciente para continuar indagando en este tema. Lo que sucede es que al estar contando esto a mis padres, ellos no establecen ningun tipo de contacto visual, ademas de estar no estar enteramente cien poniendo toda su atencion en lo que les estoy contando. Al terminar de contar mi relato, no obtengo ningun comentario que aporte valor a la conversacion, sino mas bien un ‘que bien’, pero sin colaborar en la conversacion. Que esta pasando aqui? Vamos a enfocar lo evidente: falta de contacto visual, falta de atencion, falta de implicacion. La falta de contacto visual puede tener efectos muy negativos en el autoestima de la persona, sin importar la edad, ya que la falta de contacto visual es una falta de empatia. Las miradas son y han sido un factor muy importante para la comunicacion humana. Luego la falta de atencion tambien afecta negativamente en el autoestima de la persona, ya que cuando comunicamos algo, lo hacemos con la intencion de ser escuchados y tener la entera atencion del espectador. Pudiendo hacernos pensar que lo que estamos contando no es importante, o quiza que la manera en la que lo comunicamos no es atrayente, o correcta, generando uno detras de otro estimulos negativos para nuestro cerebro. La falta de implicacion, ya comentado, al finalizar nuestro hallazgo esperamos inconscientemente una accion que implique un reconocimiento o una aportacion a nuestra conversacion, funcionando como un estimulo positivo. La falta de este estimulo, puede crear un pensamiento de que lo que se dice no es interesante, o que la persona no esta interesada realmente en nosotros, por lo que una vez mas afecta negativamente a nivel psicologico, pudiendo fomentar la no comunicacion en un futuro cercano si esto se convierte en algo habitual. Y es que en nuestra sociedad, la comunicacion es algo muy importante para las relaciones sociales, y si estas relaciones sociales se enfrian debido a un estimulo procedente de un dispositivo inerte, las personas cada vez tenderan mas a no interactuar entre si de manera 15 directa y tener mas problemas de comunicacion, expresion, autoestima, empatia y en general las relaciones sociales. 16 8.) Sobre la salud fisica No esta demas tambien hablar sobre las implicaciones sobre la salud que ejercen las redes sociales indirectamente. Algunas de ellas pueden ser el sindrome del tunel carpiano por estar todo el dia tecleando en tu telefono movil, o bien problemas en la vista, que una misma tiene debido al uso del telefono. Fatiga, que como hemos comentado puede afectar a la calidad y cantidad del sueno. Accidentes al volante debido a estar mirando el movil, o bien la falta de ejercicio y actividades al aire libre por el echo de estar inmersos durante horas en nuestros telefonos moviles. Esta nueva adiccion puede estar afectando negativamente a nuestro cuerpo. Como? Al estar constantemente utilizando nuestros telefonos moviles, nuestros ligamentos pueden sufrir el sindrome del tunel carpiano, ocasionando dolor en el brazo, dolor en las manos al realizar movimientos cotidianos, torpeza al agarrar objetos, entumecimiento de los dedos y demas. Y esto no es una exageracion, es una realidad. Tambien tenemos la fatiga ocasionada que afecta el sueno, que hemos comentado en capitulos anteriores. Y accidentes mientras conducimos debido al foco de nuestra atencion a los telefonos moviles. Muchas personas no identifican el uso de las redes sociales como un problema para actividades al aire libre, pero esta comprobado que el uso de las redes sociales genera una adiccion, que nos hace estar menos abiertos o inclinados por actividades al aire libre cuando podemos estar viendo en su lugar videos de personas que realizan estas actividades, o videos de cualquier otro tema. A parte de esto, muchas veces podemos ver un cambio en la postura, muchas veces vemos a personas por ejemplo esperando en cola, y viendo sus telefonos moviles, y al ver su postura se puede observar que es una L perfecta, su cuerpo totalmente recto y a partir de su cuello se inclina completamente, teniendo una postura totalmente antinatural. Tambien podemos ver un encorvamiento de la espalda en muchas ocasiones, ya sea por el uso del telefono movil o bien por la falta de ejercicio fisico incentivado por el uso de su tiempo libre en redes sociales en vez de en deportes o actividades al aire libre. Ademas de que las redes sociales han incrementado el porcentaje de tiempo que pasamos sentados, esto tambien puede afectar a nuestro sistema circulatorio, teniendo consecuencias fatales a largo plazo para los diferentes organos del cuerpo. 17 9.) Sobre las redes sociales como herramienta de manipulacion Como hemos comentado anteriormente, las redes sociales son altamente adictivas, no sabria contar las veces que una persona revisa tu telefono movi al dial, pero estoy segura de que existen aplicaciones para comprobarlo, y este numero probablemente nos asustaria. Este tipo de tecnologia muchas veces nos ofrece contenido de valor, pero seguramente el porcentaje de contenido que no es de valor supera altamente al contenido de valor que vemos. Este contenido que carece de algun valor, puede llegar a generar un vacio existencial. Esto es debido a que un contenido de valor, como pueda ser una noticia, una receta, o bien algo relacionado con descubrimiento, o informacion sobre un volcan, rutinas de entrenamiento, etc; nos aporta algo, algo que es constructivo, que nos hace aprender, entonces esto nos aporta un valor. Sin embargo, las redes sociales estan llenas en su mayoria de contenido que no aporta ningun valor de ningun tipo a nuestro cerebro, este tipo de contenido puede ser un video de un usuario promocionando una crema, un video de un gato saltando y cayendose, un video de una persona masticando, un video de una persona grabandose a si misma mientras camina, o videos de personas haciendo cosas estupidas. Estos videos pueden ser divertidos, pero a nivel racional no nos estan aportando ningun contenido de valor, sino contenido vacio sin sentido alguno. En lo que respecta a la manipulacion, las redes sociales son frecuentemente utilizadas para fines politicos, y muchas de esas veces los usuarios comparten noticias falsas sobre un partido u otro, generando una comparticion de esos videos o esos post a gran escala, sin comprobarse la veracidad de lo que estamos viendo, escuchando o leyendo. Esto es utilizado como manera de manipulacion con un fin, conseguir sus metas. Hace anos en Espana, antes de que las redes sociales se popularizasen tanto, los diferentes medios senalaron que la culpa de la falta de empleo en espana la tenian los inmigrantes, que los inmigrantes le estaban quitando los empleos a los espanoles. Bien, estos inmigrantes que ellos decian, se dedicaban a la recogida de frutas de temporada, mano de obra, y demas empleos que la mayor parte de los espanoles no quiere realizar debido a que son empleos muy castigados y cansados, y tambien muy mal pagados, por lo que aun habiendo un indice de paro alarmante, ni si quiera los espanoles querian trabajar en ello debido al bajo salario y las condiciones laborales. 18 Pongo este ejemplo para compararlo con la actualidad, y la utilizacion de las redes sociales. Una idea es como un virus, se contagia, al estar expuestos constantemente a este tipo de videos en las redes sociales, finalmente terminamos por creer la informacion que estamos viendo, y en muchas ocasiones no revisamos diferentes medios de informacion para verificar si lo que estamos viendo o escuchando es realmente cierto, por lo que aqui vienen las Fake news. Al pasar la mayor parte del nuestras horas libres expuestos a este bombardeo de informacion, somos mas vulnerables a la manipulacion por parte de terceros. Estos terceros proceden de vertientes, movimientos, partidos politicos que sin nosotros darnos cuenta nos estan convenciendo a traves de usuarios como nosotros de lo que realmente quieren que pensemos. Toda esta desinformacion y propaganda malintencionada, hace que cada dia es mas dificil saber si es verdad o es mentira, si una noticia es real o es falsa. Las redes sociales ayudan a compartir informacion tergiversada, convirtiendo a los partidos politicos y otros movimientos en algo muy peligroso para la sociedad. Es bien sabido desde tiempos inmemoriales por los movimientos politicos el ‘Divide y venceras’. Actualmente no existe nada que regule estas practicas inmorales, y no se sabe las repercusiones que podrian tener a largo plazo en nuestra sociedad. Pero los partidos politicos ya han utilizado las redes sociales durante sus campanas electorales, campanas como por ejemplo el escandalo durante el Brexit, en el cual aumento el uso de las redes sociales y las Fake news para polarizar y manipular a los votantes. O en Estados Unidos durante las elecciones en las que gano Donal Trump, en las que Face(...) proporciono datos de millones de persona a traves de Cambridge Analytica, para crear contenido personalizado sobre las elecciones a cada usuario, lo que parece escalofriante. Por ello, su creador Mark Zuckerberg fue citado a declarar ante una comisión del Parlamento británico. Este tipo de manipulacion es una realidad, y puede generar muchos conflictos a gran escala con algo tan peligroso y volatil como son las redes sociales. Por lo que siempre hay que revisar distintas fuentes de informacion para verificar si la noticia que estamos viendo es real, o mas bien es una noticia dirigida expresamente a nosotros debido a la informacion que tienen guardada de nosotros. 19 10.) Sobre las implicaciones en ninos No es un secreto que el sistema por el que se rige el mundo es un sistema capitalista. Pueden llamarlo democracia aqui en Europa, pero la democracia real no tiene nada que ver con nuestro sistema politico. Entonces, si el sistema por el cual nos regimos es un sistema capitalista, con sus leyes y sus normas, y estas empresas encuentran un canal en el cual no hay casi restricciones a nivel publicitario, porque no usarlo? Antiguamente las empresas publicitaban sus servicios en pancartas, periodicos, flyers, etc. Tambien organizaban eventos (que a dia de hoy se sigue haciendo), o las mas pudientes, se publicitaban en television. Luego, el gran Youtub(..) nacio, y se convirtio en otra manera eficaz de publicitarse. Estas son algunas de las formas que las empresas han utilizado a lo largo del tiempo para publicitarse, y en todas ellas encontramos algo en comun: una regularizacion legal por parte de los gobiernos. Por ejemplo, como comente, para anuncios publicitarios solamente pueden mostrase como minimo a adolescentes, teniendo grandes restricciones por ser menores de edad. Bien, por ejemplo YouTub(...), que tambien trabaja de la mano con Googl(...) para sus campanas de anuncios, tienen restricciones de contenido para adolescentes, tales como alcohol, contenido agresivo, lenguaje, etc. (implicaciones psicologicas, sociales, generacionales, conducta, dependencia, ansiedad, manipulacion electoral desde jovenes por medio de las redes sociales","completion":"10.) Sur les implications chez les enfants Ce n'est un secret pour personne que le monde est régi par un système capitaliste. On peut l'appeler démocratie ici en Europe, mais la démocratie réelle n'a rien à voir avec notre système politique. Alors, si le système qui nous régit est un système capitaliste, avec ses lois et ses règles, et que ces entreprises trouvent un canal où il n'y a presque pas de restrictions en matière de publicité, pourquoi ne pas l'utiliser ? Dans le passé, les entreprises faisaient de la publicité pour leurs services sur des pancartes, des journaux, des tracts, etc. Elles organisaient également des événements (qui sont encore pratiqués aujourd'hui), ou les plus riches se faisaient de la publicité à la télévision. Ensuite, le grand Youtub(..) est né et est devenu un autre moyen efficace de se faire de la publicité. Ce sont quelques-unes des façons dont les entreprises se sont fait de la publicité au fil du temps, et dans chacune d'elles, nous trouvons quelque chose en commun : une réglementation légale de la part des gouvernements. Par exemple, comme je l'ai mentionné, pour les annonces publicitaires, elles ne peuvent être diffusées qu'aux adolescents, avec de grandes restrictions pour les mineurs. Eh bien, par exemple YouTub(...), qui travaille également en collaboration avec Googl(...) pour ses campagnes publicitaires, a des restrictions de contenu pour les adolescents, comme l'alcool, le contenu agressif, le langage, etc. Cela a des implications psychologiques, sociales, générationnelles, comportementales, de dépendance, d'anxiété, de manipulation électorale dès le plus jeune âge à travers les réseaux sociaux."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:_,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],E={key:0},R={key:1};function W(n,e,l,m,o,r){const u=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",P,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
