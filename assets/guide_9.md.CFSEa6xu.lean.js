Грабеж представляет собой одно из серьезных преступлений, которое наносит значительный ущерб не только пострадавшим, но и обществу в целом. В этом реферате мы рассмотрим, каким образом происходит квалификация грабежа на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела и какие основные элементы учитываются при этом. Грабеж, согласно уголовному законодательству, является целенаправленным хищением чужого имущества путем насильственного отбирания или угрозы применения насилия. При определении характера преступления на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела следует учитывать несколько ключевых элементов. Во-первых, необходимо проанализировать насильственные действия, предпринятые против потерпевшего. Если преступник использовал физическую силу или угрожал применением насилия в отношении пострадавшего, то грабеж квалифицируется как тяжкое преступление. Если же пострадавший не подвергался физическому воздействию и преступник осуществил хищение с помощью угрозы применения насилия, то грабеж квалифицируется как менее тяжкое преступление. Во-вторых, необходимо учитывать степень утраты пострадавшего. Если хищение имущества причинило значительный экономический ущерб либо поставило потерпевшего в тяжелое финансовое положение, грабеж квалифицируется как особо крупное преступление. В случаях, когда хищение обладает относительно невеликой материальной ценностью и не оказывает серьезного влияния на экономику пострадавшего, грабеж квалифицируется как менее тяжкое преступление. В-третьих, квалификация грабежа также зависит от применения оружия или других предметов, способных угрожать жизни и здоровью пострадавшего. Если преступник вооружен или использует предметы, способные нанести серьезный вред здоровью человека, грабеж квалифицируется как особо опасное преступление. В случаях, когда хищение производится без использования угрозы жизни или здоровья, грабеж квалифицируется как менее опасное преступление. Квалификация грабежа на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела имеет существенное значение для определения степени вины и назначения соответствующего наказания преступнику. Учитывая вышеперечисленные элементы, следователь должен установить основные факты, осуществившие состав преступления, а также представить эту информацию суду для принятия окончательного решения по делу. В заключение, квалификация грабежа на стадии возбуждения уголовного дела требует тщательного анализа и учета нескольких ключевых элементов, таких как насильственные действия против потерпевшего, степень утраты, применение оружия или предметов, способных угрожать жизни и здоровью. Обоснованное и объективное определение характера совершенного преступления является основой для справедливого рассмотрения дела и назначения соответствующего наказания преступнику."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Eп - входное напряжение: 3 вольта.","completion":"Из предоставленной вами информации явно видно, что вы упомянули параметры, которые могут относиться к работе транзистора в схеме. Однако, некоторые обозначения кажутся нестандартными или использованы неправильно. Давайте попробуем разобраться: 1. Uce (U_CE) обычно обозначает напряжение между коллектором (C) и эмиттером (E) транзистора, а не напряжение эмиттер-база, которое обозначается как Ube (U_BE). Если U_CE действительно равно 3,3 вольта, это означает, что между коллектором и эмиттером присутствует напряжение в 3,3 вольта. 2. I_C (ток коллектора) равный 0,015 ампера или 15 мА, показывает, сколько тока течет через коллектор транзистора. 3. Uвых (напряжение на выходе) равное 1,5 вольта, вероятно, является напряжением на нагрузке (Rн) или на резисторе, который включен последовательно с коллектором в схеме усилителя. 4. Rн (нагрузочное сопротивление) в 200 Ом – это сопротивление, через которое протекает ток коллектора, и относительно которого измеряется напряжение на выходе (Uвых). 5. Fн (частота нагрузки) в 60 Гц предполагает, что схема работает на частоте 60 Гц, что является стандартом частоты переменного тока в некоторых странах (например, в США). 6. Eп (входное напряжение) равное 3 вольта, возможно, это напряжение, приложенное к базе транзистора, что необходимо для его управления и поддержания нормального режима работы. Из этой информации можно сделать один расчет: можно вычислить напряжение на резисторе нагрузки (Rн), используя закон Ома (V = I * R), где I - ток через резистор, а R - сопротивление. V_Rн = I_C * Rн = 0,015 A * 200 Ом = 3 В Однако, если Uвых составляет 1,5 В и оно измеряется на Rн, то либо предыдущий расчет некорректен, либо есть другие элементы в схеме, которые влияют на напряжение на выходе (например, падение напряжения на других компонентах). Также возможно использование этих данных для анализа работы усилителя на транзисторе или другой электронной схеме. Если вам нужно сделать конкретный расчет или анализ, уточните вашу цель, и я смогу предоставить более целенаправленный ответ."},{"prompt":"1. Ucе (U_ce) - напряжение эмиттер-база: 3,3 вольта. 2.

Eп - входное напряжение: 3 вольта.","completion":"К сожалению, некоторые обозначения все еще являются нетипичными и могут привести к путанице. Возможно, имеется в виду следующее: 1. U_CE - как уже было сказано, обычно обозначает напряжение между коллектором и эмиттером, но если подразумевается U_BE (напряжение база-эмиттер), то 3,3 вольта это довольно высокое значение для кремниевого транзистора, где типичное напряжение база-эмиттер составляет около 0.6-0.7 вольта. Если же все же используется U_CE, тогда это напряжение между коллектором и эмиттером транзистора. 2. I_C - ток коллектора 0,015 ампера или 15 мА. Это стандартное обозначение для коллекторного тока. 4. R_н - нагрузочное сопротивление 200 Ом, которое можно использовать для расчета напряжения на нагрузке. 3. U_вых - напряжение на выходе 1,5 вольта, вероятно, измерено на нагрузочном резисторе R_н. 5. F_н - частота нагрузки 60 Гц. Это может упоминаться в контексте частоты сигнала на выходе, если схема работает с сигналами переменного тока. 6. E_п - входное напряжение 3 вольта. Это может быть входным напряжением, которое подается на базу транзистора. Исходя из этих данных, можно произвести несколько расчетов. Предположим, напряжение на нагрузочном сопротивлении (R_н) действительно равно напряжению на выходе (U_вых). Следовательно, напряжение на нагрузке составляет 1,5 вольта, и ток через нагрузку можно вычислить по закону Ома: I_н = U_вых / R_н = 1.5 В / 200 Ом = 0.0075 A или 7.5 mA Однако, эти расчеты не совпадают с заявленным коллекторным током I_C в 15 мА. Это может указывать на то, что в схеме есть другие элементы, либо данные предоставлены с ошибкой, либо мы имеем дело с несовершенным транзистором, у которого часть тока теряется из-за рекомбинации в базе.

They also shared their own diary content with us. The children gathered together, sipping warm milk, each holding a diary filled with words. I stood up and walked to the blackboard, starting the discussion about the characteristics of a diary. I explained to them that a diary is a personal way to record one's life. It can document our emotions, experiences, and moments of joy or sadness throughout the day. The characteristics of a diary include timeliness, privacy, and casualness. \\"Timeliness,\\" I told the children, \\"means that a diary is written in chronological order. We write down events and experiences as they happen, following the timeline of our lives.\\" The children nodded, showing their understanding. \\"Privacy,\\" I continued, \\"means that a diary is meant for ourselves only. It is a private space where we can freely express our feelings and thoughts without any judgment.\\" The children listened attentively, nodding in agreement. \\"Casualness,\\" I explained at last, \\"means that there are no strict rules or requirements when it comes to writing a diary. You can write in any style you like, whether it's words, pictures, or even stickers. Your diary is a conversation with yourself, so you can make it as casual as you want.\\" The children became even more interested, exchanging thoughts and ideas with each other.

His opinions stem largely from his staunch advocacy for free-market economics and his skeptical view of government interventions. Sowell argues that communism, and socialist economic policies in general, suffer from the inherent problem of information inefficiency; namely, that a centralized authority cannot effectively gather and utilize information as efficiently as a free market can. This view is largely influenced by the work of economist Friedrich Hayek, who famously argued that the price system in capitalism is a mechanism for communicating information through the spontaneous order of the free market. Moreover, Sowell has criticized communism for its historical track record, citing the economic failures and human rights abuses of states ruled by communist parties, such as the Soviet Union, China under Mao Zedong, and other regimes in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He underscores the lack of personal and economic freedoms that typically accompany communist governments, and argues that these lead to detrimental outcomes for the welfare of their peoples. In his discussions of various economic and political systems, Sowell frequently emphasizes the importance of incentives and the consequences they have for behavior and economic outcomes. According to Sowell, communism fails to provide the right incentives for productivity, innovation, and economic growth due to its centralized control and lack of property rights. Sowell's writing and speaking reflect a consistent belief in the superiority of markets over central planning. It's important to note that his critiques of communism are part of a larger critique of various forms of government intervention and social planning, which he believes are generally counterproductive or harmful to the economic and social well-being of individuals."},{"prompt":"what countries are/were communist according to sowell?","completion":"Thomas Sowell often refers to historical examples when discussing communism, considering both past and present communist states to illustrate his points. As of my last update in early 2023, Sowell hasn't published an exhaustive list of countries he identifies as communist, but based on his writing and commentary, we can infer some of the countries he might include: Historically: 1. The Soviet Union: Perhaps the most prominent example in any discussion of communism, the USSR existed from the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 until its dissolution in 1991. 2. China under Mao Zedong: While China has significantly reformed its economy towards market systems, Sowell often points to the Mao-era China (1949-1976) as an example of communism's failures. 3. Eastern Bloc countries: Nations of Eastern Europe that were aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, such as East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and others, were considered communist states. 4. Cuba under Fidel Castro: Since the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba has been a symbol of communism in the Western Hemisphere. 5. North Korea: Officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, it has been a communist state since its inception in 1948 under Kim Il-sung, and it remains one of the most stringent communist dictatorships today, although its ideology has since evolved into the unique Juche philosophy. 6. Vietnam: Unified under communist rule after the Vietnam War, with the fall of Saigon in 1975. 7. Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge: Though Pol Pot's regime was relatively short-lived (1975-1979), it was marked by severe brutality and is often cited as an example of communist totalitarianism. Contemporary: 1. The People's Republic of China: While China has incorporated many elements of a market economy, it is still ruled by the Communist Party of China and maintains a political system consistent with communist ideology. 2. Cuba: Despite reforms, Cuba remains a communist state, now under the leadership of Miguel Díaz-Canel, who succeeded Raul Castro. 3.

Per esempio, una colonna destinata a contenere date dovrebbe contenere solo valori di data, mentre una colonna destinata a importi in denaro dovrebbe contenere solo valori numerici che rappresentano gli importi. Questa omogeneità è importante per varie ragioni: 1. **Calcoli e Funzioni**: Perché le funzioni di aggregazione (come somma, media, conteggio, ecc.) possano essere eseguite correttamente. Se una colonna contiene tipi di dati misti, potrebbero verificarsi errori o risultati inattesi. 2. **Ordinamento e Filtraggio**: Per poter ordinare e filtrare i dati correttamente. Dati incoerenti possono causare errori di ordinamento e filtraggio inaspettati. 3. **Integrità dei Dati**: Per mantenere l'integrità dei dati. Dati non omogenei possono portare a interpretazioni errate e decisioni basate su analisi imprecise. 4. **Usabilità della Tabella Pivot**: I valori non omogenei possono rendere la tabella pivot meno funzionale e più difficile da usare e interpretare. Se durante la creazione della tabella pivot si incontrano dati incompatibili o incongruenti, è comune ricevere un errore o notare che la tabella pivot non mostra correttamente le informazioni. Questo è un chiaro segnale che è necessario pulire o standardizzare i dati nella fonte prima di procedere con la creazione della tabella pivot. Per esempio, utilizzando Microsoft Excel o Google Sheets, tipici passi da seguire per assicurare l'omogeneità dei dati potrebbero include: - Verificare che non ci siano intestazioni duplicate o mancanti. - Assicurarsi che ogni colonna contenga dati dello stesso tipo (numeri, date, testo, ecc.). - Rimuovere o correggere dati mancanti o incoerenti. - Utilizzare formattazioni appropriate per le diverse tipologie di dati. Seguendo queste linee guida, si può garantire che la tabella pivot possa essere creata con successo e che i risultati siano precisi e affidabili."},{"prompt":"일본에서 갤럭시를 쓰는 사람이 매우 드물다는데, 사실인가요?","completion":"네, 사실입니다. 일본 시장에서 삼성 갤럭시 같은 한국 스마트폰의 점유율은 상당히 낮습니다. 이러한 현상에는 여러 가지 이유가 있습니다: 1. **브랜드 인지도와 인기**: 일본 내에서는 애플의 아이폰이 매우 인기가 높으며, 스마트폰 시장에서 큰 점유율을 차지하고 있습니다. 그 밖에 현지 브랜드인 소니, 샤프 등도 강세를 보이고 있죠. 2. **정치적 긴장**: 과거 일본과 한국 간의 정치적 긴장감도 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 이러한 긴장은 무역 분쟁이나 소비자들의 브랜드 선호에도 영향을 미치기도 했습니다. 3. **마케팅 전략**: 삼성이 일본 시장에서 겪은 일부 마케팅 문제로 인해 브랜드에 대한 인식이 부정적으로 형성됐을 수 있습니다. 4. **통신사와의 제휴**: 일본의 주요 통신사들은 특정 브랜드와 강한 제휴 관계를 맺고 있을 수 있으며, 이는 고객 선택에 영향을 미칩니다. 5. **국내 브랜드 지원**: 일본은 국내 산업을 지원하는 경향이 강합니다. 스마트폰 뿐만 아니라 다른 전자제품 분야에서도 일본 브랜드가 선호될 수 있는 현상입니다. 그러나 이러한 상황에도 불구하고 삼성은 일본 시장에서의 입지를 강화하기 위해 노력해 왔으며, 최신 기술과 혁신적 제품들을 내놓으면서 점차적으로 인식을 개선해 나가고 있습니다."},{"prompt":"중국,일본을 제외한 국가에서는 의외로 삼성 갤럭시가 휴대폰 판매율이 1위라는 조사도 있던데, 이것도 펙트체크해주세요 중국과 일본은 애플과 샤오미,화웨이 등 특수 변수가 있기에 제외하기로 합시다.","completion":"삼성 갤럭시가 일부 국가들에서 스마트폰 판매율 1위를 차지하는 것은 사실입니다. 중국과 일본을 제외한 많은 국가에서 삼성은 강력한 시장 점유율을 가진 주요 스마트폰 제조사로 자리잡고 있습니다. 삼성 갤럭시 시리즈는 그 다양성과 가격대의 폭으로 전 세계 다양한 소비자들의 요구에 부응하고 있습니다. 플래그십 모델인 갤럭시 S 시리즈와 갤럭시 노트 시리즈는 고성능과 혁신적인 기능으로 많은 사용자들에게 호평을 받고 있습니다. 또한, 갤럭시 A 시리즈와 같은 중저가 모델도 가격대비 성능이 뛰어나 가성비를 중시하는 소비자들에게 인기가 많습니다. 특히, 유럽, 라틴 아메리카, 중동, 아프리카 및 일부 아시아 지역에서 삼성은 스마트폰 시장에서 상당한 점유율을 차지하고 있으며 때로는 애플과 경쟁하여 1위를 차지하곤 합니다. 그러나 이러한 시장 지위는 시간에 따라 변할 수 있으며, 더불어 경쟁사인 화웨이, 오포(OPPO), 비보(Vivo)와 같은 중국 브랜드들도 특히 아시아와 다른 신흥 시장에서 빠르게 성장하면서 삼성의 시장 점유율을 압박하고 있습니다. 업계 조사 회사들의 보고서와 시장 데이터를 통해 주기적으로 이러한 판매 순위와 시장 점유율이 공개되고 있으므로, 정확한 현재 상황을 파악하기 위해서는 최신의 데이터를 참조해야 합니다."},{"prompt":"그말에 동의합니다. 최근 2024년 기사에 의하면 또 애플이 삼성을 전세계를 대상으로 점유율을 이겼다고 나왔습니다.","completion":"스마트폰 시장의 판매 순위와 점유율은 매우 경쟁적이며 시시각각 변화하고 있습니다. 최신 기사나 보고서에 따르면 애플이 삼성을 따라잡거나 앞서나가는 경우도 있습니다. 애플의 아이폰은 특히 새로운 모델이 출시될 때 높은 판매량을 기록하며, 각 지역별로 소비자의 선호도와 특정 시점의 경제 상황이 판매에 큰 영향을 미칩니다. 애플과 삼성은 모두 강력한 브랜드 파워와 혁신적인 기술, 그리고 폭넓은 제품 라인업으로 전 세계 스마트폰 시장에서 양대 산맥으로 자리매김하고 있습니다. 그러나 다른 요인들도 시장 점유율에 영향을 미치는데, 예를 들면 제품 출시 주기, 로열티 프로그램, 마케팅 전략, 지역별 경제 상황, 소비자의 구매력 등이 있습니다. 이러한 변동성은 애플과 삼성이 지속적으로 시장을 장악하기 위해 끊임없이 혁신하고, 타깃 시장을 재조정하며, 새로운 마케팅 전략을 수립해야 한다는 것을 의미합니다. 각 기업의 분기별 또는 연간 보고서, 그리고 시장 조사 기관의 발표를 통해 현재의 시장 동향과 점유율 변동을 파악할 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"애플과 삼성과의 관계가 마냥 좋은 거 같지 않고, 라이벌 그 이상의 관계를 가진거 같은데, 원래부터 삼성과 애플은 라이벌 관계였었나요?","completion":"애플과 삼성의 관계는 복잡하고 다면적입니다. 한편으로는 서로의 주요 라이벌로서 격렬한 경쟁을 벌여 왔고, 다른 한편으로는 비즈니스 파트너로서 서로 협력하고 있습니다. 초기에 애플은 자사의 아이폰과 아이패드를 위한 주요 부품 공급자로 삼성을 활용했습니다. 예를 들어, 삼성은 애플의 주요 메모리 칩과 디스플레이 패널을 제공하는 등의 역할을 해왔습니다. 이런 식으로 두 회사는 공급망 파트너십을 통해 상호 이익을 누려왔습니다. 그러나 이와 더불어 애플과 삼성은 소비자 스마트폰 시장에서 격렬한 라이벌 관계를 형성해왔습니다. 특히 2010년대 초에 들어서면서 두 회사 사이에는 디자인과 기술 특허를 둘러싼 법적 분쟁이 촉발됐습니다. 애플은 삼성이 아이폰의 디자인을 모방했다고 주장했고, 이에 대해 삼성은 자사의 특허를 침해당했다고 맞섰습니다. 이로 인해 양사는 여러 국가에서 다수의 법정 소송을 벌였고, 이것은 스마트폰 산업 내에서 가장 주목받는 법적 분쟁 중 하나가 되었습니다. 이 분쟁은 기술 산업에 대한 지식 재산권의 중요성을 대중들에게 더욱 강조하는 계기가 되었습니다. 시간이 지남에 따라 두 회사는 일부 합의에 도달하여 법적 분쟁을 종결했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 애플과 삼성은 여전히 스마트폰 시장에서 주요 경쟁자로 남아 있으며 각자의 제품 라인과 기술 혁신으로 시장 점유율을 높이기 위해 경쟁하고 있습니다. 결국 애플과 삼성의 관계는 경쟁과 협력이 공존하는 '경쟁 공생(coopetition)'의 전형적인 예로 볼 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"아!, 이런것도 궁금한데 물어보겠습니다. 애플은 회사는 미국에 있고, 공장은 중국에 있는 걸로 알고 있는데, 중국에서는 민주화운동이후에 엄격하게 반체제,선동에 관련된 정보를 통제하고 있으며 중국 당국은 중국 회사에게 영장 없이 각종 정보를 요구할 수 있게 바꾼 것으로 알고 있는데, 이는 애플 공장에도 해당되는 사항인가요?

Since you mentioned that you have unlabeled data, meaning you only have source language sentences and no target language translations, you won't be able to train a machine translation model from scratch or fine-tune a pre-existing model without corresponding target language data. However, if you still want to leverage Transformer models for translation with your unlabeled data, you have a few options: 1. **Use Pretrained Models**: Find a pre-trained Transformer-based machine translation model such as those provided by Google's T5, Facebook's M2M-100, Hugging Face's Transformers library, or OpenAI's GPT-3. These models are trained on vast amounts of labeled data and can translate your source language data into a target language. You would use these models as they are, in an inference mode. 2. **Data Augmentation**: If you're looking to train or fine-tune a Transformer model with your data, you'll need target language translation. Depending on the source language of your data, you might be able to use a high-quality machine translation service to generate the first draft of translations for your source language data. You would use these translations to create a synthetic parallel corpus which you could then use to train or fine-tune a machine translation model. Regarding the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric, it is a measurement that compares a candidate translation of text to one or more reference translations. To use BLEU, you must have: - The candidate translation generated by the machine translation system. - The reference translations against which the candidate translation is compared. The BLEU score is calculated based on n-gram precision, with a penalty for overly short translations (brevity penalty). It ranges from 0 to 1, where a score of 1 means a perfect match between the candidate and the reference texts. In practice, BLEU scores are often multiplied by 100 to be presented as percentages. Without target language reference translations, you can't directly compute the BLEU score for the translations produced by your model. You would need to first obtain reference translations either by obtaining a labeled dataset, using an existing high-quality translation, or by manually translating a subset of your data to use for evaluation purposes. To measure the BLEU score for machine-generated translations, you can do the following: 1. Translate your source language data using a translation model. 2. Compare the model's translations with the reference translations. 3. Use a BLEU scoring implementation, like the one in the NLTK library for Python, to compute the BLEU score: \`\`\`python import nltk.translate.bleu_score as bleu # Assume hypothesis is the model's translation, and reference is the actual human translation hypothesis = \\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\".split() reference = \\"a quick brown fox leaps over the lazy dog\\".split() # For BLEU, reference sentences have to be wrapped in another list references = [reference] # Calculate BLEU score score = bleu.sentence_bleu(references, hypothesis) print(\\"BLEU Score: \\", score * 100) \`\`\` Please note that while BLEU is a popular metric for evaluating translation quality, it has its limitations, and alternative metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, or human evaluation may offer a more complete assessment of translation quality."},{"prompt":"m data just has source","completion":"If you only have data in the source language and none in the target language, you will not be able to train a supervised machine translation model, as these require parallel corpora (matched sentences in both source and target languages) for training purposes. Similarly, for evaluating translations with metrics like BLEU, you need reference translations in the target language to compare against machine-generated translations. Nevertheless, you can still work with your source-only data by using pre-trained Transformer models capable of translation. Here's how you can proceed: # Utilizing Pretrained Models 1. **Identify a Suitable Model**: Find a pre-trained Transformer-based machine translation model that supports the language pair of interest. The \\"Transformers\\" library by Hugging Face provides a wide range of models that can translate between various languages. 2. **Translate Your Data**: Use the pre-trained model to translate your source sentences into the target language. The translations generated by the model could then be considered a synthetic target dataset. 3. **Quality Check**: Since your translations are machine-generated, you might want to perform some quality checks or validation. This could be a manual inspection of a subset of translations to ensure they are reasonable. # Evaluation without Reference Translations Without target language reference translations, you can't compute BLEU or similar metrics accurately. However, if you wish to get a sense of the quality of machine translations, you can consider the following options: 1. **Manual Inspection**: Conduct a qualitative, manual evaluation of a random sample of machine translations. This might involve having bilingual speakers assess the fluency and accuracy of translations. 2. **Professional Assessment**: Hire language experts or use a language service to provide professional translations of a subset of your data or to evaluate the quality of your model-generated translations. 3. **Pseudo-Evaluation**: Use the machine-generated translations as \\"pseudo-references\\" to evaluate newer versions of your translation system or configurations, fully acknowledging that this will not give an accurate reflection of quality but might help in system development. This is not a standard practice and is not recommended for any official evaluation of translation quality. 4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: If you have a moderate amount of source language data and access to even a small parallel corpus, you might explore semi-supervised approaches that can leverage both your large source-only dataset and the smaller parallel dataset to improve translation quality. 5. **Utilize Online Services**: For evaluating the translations of your unlabeled data using metrics like BLEU, you could potentially leverage online translation services to generate translations for your source sentences, then use those as \\"references\\". This obviously comes with the caveats that these translations might not be perfect and that it could be costly depending on the amount of data. In short, without reference translations in a target language, objective, metric-based evaluation using BLEU or similar metrics is not possible. Your focus would rather be on using pre-trained models for translation and on qualitative evaluation methods to get an initial sense of the translation quality."},{"prompt":"merhaba chat bir araştırma yapıyorum ve yaklaşık bir iş akış şeması fikri oluşturmak için seninle bir analiz yapmak istiyorum.bu sadece şu anlık bir taslak fikri aşaması dolasıyla beni herhangi bir uzmana yönlendirmeden benimle birlikte bir şema oluştur. ben mimarım ve konu hakkında yakınsak uzmanlığım var. öncelikle sana hazırladığım üç metni vericem bunlar üzerinden değerlendirmelerimize başlıyacaz. amacımız bu işin gerçekleşme aşamları için bir önizleme senaryo oluşturmak. bu senaryolardan faydalanarak daha sonra işlerimi","completion":"Merhaba!

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"A 91 year old hospital patient who had a severe stroke 5 days ago is having trouble swallowing. Is it possible that it is because she is restricted to 30 degrees","completion":"Difficulty with swallowing, known as dysphagia, can certainly be a consequence of a stroke. After a stroke, many people experience dysphagia because the event can affect the areas of the brain responsible for the coordination of the muscles and reflexes needed for swallowing. Regarding the patient's positioning at 30 degrees, this partially upright position is typically recommended to help reduce the risk of aspiration, which can occur if food or liquids enter the airway. While the 30-degree position can help reduce this risk, it's not a direct cause of the swallowing difficulties. Instead, the dysphagia is more directly related to the stroke's impact on the brain. Swallowing difficulties after a stroke should be evaluated and managed by healthcare professionals, including speech-language pathologists who specialize in dysphagia. These specialists often perform swallow assessments and may recommend different strategies or therapies to help with swallowing. These can include swallow exercises, changes in diet consistency, or, in some cases, alternative methods of nutrition (like a feeding tube) while the individual recovers their ability to swallow safely. The management plan should be personalized to the patient's specific needs and the degree of swallowing impairment. Close monitoring and frequent reassessment are essential to ensure that the patient is able to receive adequate nutrition and hydration while minimizing the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other complications related to dysphagia."},{"prompt":"The patient may need a ng tube because she has trouble swallowing. Is it better to leave the ng tube in or only insert when being fed","completion":"When a patient has trouble swallowing (dysphagia) due to a condition such as a severe stroke, a nasogastric (NG) tube may be used to provide nutrition and medication. The decision on whether to leave an NG tube in place or insert it only for feedings depends on several factors, including the patient's specific medical situation, the expected duration of tube feeding, the patient's risk for complications, and healthcare provider recommendations. Here are considerations for both approaches: **Leaving the NG Tube in Place:** - **Convenience**: The tube is ready for use, which can make feeding and medication administration more manageable, especially if feedings are frequent. - **Comfort**: Repeated insertions can be uncomfortable or distressing for the patient. - **Safety**: The position of the tube can be confirmed after insertion and does not need to be checked before each feeding if left in place. **Inserting the NG Tube Only for Feedings:** - **Nasal and Throat Discomfort**: Continuous wear can cause nasal and throat discomfort or irritation, as well as an increased risk of pressure sores and ulcerations in the nares or oropharynx. - **Reduced Risk of Accidental Dislodgement**: If the patient is active or disoriented, there might be a higher risk of the tube being pulled out. - **Aesthetic Reasons**: Patients and their families might prefer not to see the tube in place. In practice, healthcare providers often choose to leave an NG tube in place for patients who require continuous or long-term tube feeding. This is done to minimize discomfort and avoid the risks associated with repeated insertions. However, if the NG tube is only needed for short-term use, or if tube feedings are not very frequent, some healthcare teams might opt for intermittent insertion. Proper care of the insertion site and monitoring for potential complications are important in either scenario. For any patient requiring an NG tube, the decision should be made by the healthcare team in conjunction with the patient and their family, taking into account the clinical scenario, patient's overall condition, risk of aspiration, and the need for ongoing nutritional support. If it becomes evident that the need for tube feeding will be long-term or permanent, other options, such as a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, might be considered, as they are generally more comfortable and convenient for the patient over an extended period."},{"prompt":"In a third world hospital, would risks like infection be higher or lower by leaving the tube in or inserting only when feeding","completion":"In a third-world hospital, or any healthcare setting with limited resources, the risks associated with medical procedures can be heightened due to factors such as reduced availability of sterile equipment, fewer trained healthcare workers, and potentially less stringent infection control practices. Considering these limitations, the decision to leave a nasogastric (NG) tube in place versus inserting it only when feeding may be influenced by the specific environment and available resources. **Leaving the NG Tube in Place:** - **Infection Risk**: There might be a higher risk of infection due to longer exposure and the challenges associated with maintaining the cleanliness of the tube over time. - **Resource Use**: Continuously leaving the tube in place reduces the need for repeated insertions, conserving supplies and reducing the demand on staff time. **Inserting the NG Tube Only for Feedings:** - **Infection Control**: Intermittent insertion might potentially reduce the risk of local infections at the nasal and throat insertion sites, but each insertion carries a risk of introducing pathogens. - **Equipment Sterility**: Sterile equipment is crucial, and the repetitive need for sterile conditions with each insertion might strain resources. In resource-limited settings, if the decision is to leave the tube in place, it's vital to have proper protocols to minimize the risk of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections. This includes staff training on infection control measures, appropriate tube care and maintenance, and surveillance for any signs of infection. If the decision is to insert the tube only when needed, ensuring that each insertion is done with sterile technique is crucial. However, frequent insertions can stress the already limited staff and resources and can increase patient discomfort. Infection control can be a significant concern where resources are constrained, and either choice will require careful consideration of risk versus benefit. Coordination with local healthcare providers and consideration of the facility's ability to maintain best practices regarding NG tube care are essential in making the best decision for patient care. The over-arching goal in any setting would be to provide safe, effective nutritional support while minimizing the risk of complications, including infections."},{"prompt":"What's Neurogenic fatigue?","completion":"Neurogenic fatigue, also known as neurological fatigue, is a type of fatigue that is associated with disorders of the central nervous system. It is commonly experienced by individuals with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and chronic fatigue syndrome, among others. This fatigue is not necessarily related to previous physical exertion and typically does not improve significantly with rest. Neurogenic fatigue is thought to be the result of disrupted signals in the brain, which can affect both physical and cognitive functioning. Here are some of the characteristics people with neurogenic fatigue might experience: 1. **Disproportionate to activity**: The fatigue experienced is often out of proportion to the activity performed and can occur unpredictably. 2. **Persistent and overwhelming**: Individuals may feel an overwhelming sense of tiredness that is not alleviated by sleep or rest, and it can persist over long periods. 3. **Physical and cognitive effects**: It can affect both the body and the mind, leading to physical exhaustion as well as difficulties with concentration, memory, and other cognitive tasks. 4. **Impact on daily life**: Neurogenic fatigue can significantly impact a person's quality of life, limiting their ability to perform daily activities and affecting their social and work life. 5. **Potential triggers**: Factors such as heat, humidity, stress, and infection can exacerbate the symptoms of neurogenic fatigue. The exact mechanism behind neurogenic fatigue is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve complex interactions between neurotransmitters, immune dysregulation, and hormonal imbalances within the central nervous system. Management of neurogenic fatigue typically focuses on energy conservation techniques, pacing activities, occupational therapy, medication to manage symptoms, and addressing underlying sleep disorders. Patients are also often advised on lifestyle changes that may help to mitigate some elements of fatigue, such as regular, gentle exercise and optimizing nutrition and hydration. Since neurogenic fatigue can have a significant impact on one's life, psychological support and counseling can also be an integral part of managing the condition."},{"prompt":"When is videofluroscopy usually considered","completion":"Videofluoroscopy, also known as a videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) or modified barium swallow study, is a specialized form of X-ray procedure that is used to examine how a person swallows. This test is usually considered in the following situations: 1. **Dysphagia Assessment**: Videofluoroscopy is commonly recommended when a patient reports difficulties with swallowing (dysphagia), which may be due to various causes such as stroke, neurological disorders (like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis), head and neck cancers, surgery, or degenerative diseases. 2. **Suspected Aspiration**: If there is a suspicion that food or liquid is entering the airway (aspiration), potentially leading to aspiration pneumonia, a VFSS can help identify and characterize the issue. 3. **Assessment After Surgery or Radiation**: Patients who have undergone surgery or radiation therapy to the head, neck, or chest area may be evaluated with a videofluoroscopy if they are having swallowing difficulties. 4. **Progress Monitoring**: Videofluoroscopy may be used to monitor the progress of patients who are already receiving treatment for swallowing disorders, to see if their ability to swallow has improved or if they need further treatment. 5. **Feeding Strategy Development**: The procedure can help in the development of feeding strategies for patients with chronic swallowing issues, determining the safest consistencies of food and fluids to minimize the risk of aspiration. 6. **Pediatric Applications**: In children with feeding difficulties, developmental delays, or congenital anomalies that may affect swallowing, a videofluoroscopy can be used to diagnose and plan treatment. 7. **Unexplained Coughing or Choking**: When patients have unexplained coughing or choking during or after eating or drinking, a VFSS can help to determine if these symptoms are related to swallowing problems. During the videofluoroscopic swallow study, the patient ingests a variety of foods and liquids mixed with a contrast agent (such as barium), which is visible on X-rays. The swallowing process is recorded on video, allowing health professionals like radiologists and speech-language pathologists to observe the coordination of the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus during swallowing. This detailed visualization helps them evaluate the effectiveness of swallowing, identify abnormalities, and guide therapeutic interventions. Healthcare providers consider the patient’s symptoms, clinical history, and preliminary assessments when determining whether videofluoroscopy is necessary, and the study is often part of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosing and managing swallowing disorders."},{"prompt":"If a feeding tube has been recommended by a doctor for this patient without any assessment by a qualified speech pathologist, would you ask the doctor any questions before agreeing to the ng feeding tube?","completion":"If a feeding tube has been recommended for a patient without an assessment from a qualified speech-language pathologist (SLP), who typically evaluates swallowing function, it may be beneficial to have a discussion with the doctor to ensure that the patient's care is optimized. Here are some questions you might consider asking the doctor before agreeing to the nasogastric (NG) feeding tube placement: 1. **What are the indications for recommending a feeding tube for this patient?** Understanding the specific reasons the doctor believes a feeding tube is necessary can clarify the urgency and the underlying health considerations. 2. **Has the patient's ability to swallow been formally assessed?** It's important to know if there have been any objective assessments of the patient's swallowing abilities and if other factors have been considered that may affect their ability to swallow safely. 3. **Can we arrange a swallow assessment by an SLP before proceeding?** Requesting a consult from an SLP could provide valuable information regarding the patient’s swallowing capabilities and potentially alternative strategies for safe feeding. 4. **What are the risks and benefits of NG tube feeding in this patient's case?** Discussing the risks, such as aspiration or tube displacement, versus the benefits, like ensuring nutritional requirements are met, can help make an informed decision. 5. **Is there a plan for monitoring and re-evaluating the need for the NG tube?** Understanding the plan for ongoing evaluation can give insight into the anticipated duration of tube feeding and any milestones for attempting oral feeding. 6. **What are the patient's or their family's wishes and concerns about tube feeding?** It's essential to consider the patient's preferences, values, and quality of life when making decisions about invasive interventions. 7. **Are there other options besides NG tube feeding?** Inquiring about alternative feeding methods, such as a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, in case long-term feeding support is anticipated, or methods for therapeutic swallowing rehabilitation. 8. **How will the NG tube affect the patient's comfort and care?** Understanding the implications for the patient's daily life, including comfort and the potential for complications, will help in making the right decision. 9. **Is the recommendation based on the patient's nutritional status or risk of aspiration, or both?** Nutritional status and the risk of aspiration pneumonia are common concerns leading to the decision to place an NG tube; clarifying which is the primary concern can influence the plan of care. These questions aim to gather all necessary information to make an informed decision, ensuring that the patient's care is comprehensive and considers all aspects of their health and well-being. Engaging different healthcare professionals with expertise in dysphagia and nutrition is crucial to addressing the patient's needs appropriately."},{"prompt":"If the patient gets a ng tube in a third world hospital with limited resources and low staff to patient ratio, and a family member will always be by her side, what are some things the family members should know about her care and the ng tube? What can go wrong, and what should the family members do if something goes wrong and a nurse or dr can't come quickly","completion":"If a patient receives an NG tube in a resource-limited hospital with a low staff-to-patient ratio, family members who are providing bedside support should be educated about the care of the NG tube to help monitor the patient and identify signs of potential complications. Here are some points that family members should be informed about: **Understanding the NG Tube:** - Know the purpose of the NG tube and how it should be properly positioned and secured. - Understand the feeding schedule and how to administer the feed if required to do so. - Be aware of the proper maintenance of the tube, including flushing protocols to prevent blockage. **Monitoring for Complications:** - Check for signs of infection around the nostril where the NG tube enters, such as redness, swelling, or discharge. - Observe for any respiratory changes, suggesting aspiration, such as coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. - Watch for signs of discomfort or pain that could indicate the tube has moved, become blocked, or is causing irritation. **What Can Go Wrong:** - Displacement: The NG tube can become dislodged from the stomach. Family members should be shown how to check for proper placement (usually using the marked length of insertion). - Blockage: The tube can become clogged, preventing feeds or medications. Regular flushing with water can help prevent this. - Nasal irritation: There can be discomfort, soreness, or ulcers at the nostril; proper securement can help minimize movement and irritation. - Aspiration: If the tube feeding enters the lungs, it could cause aspiration pneumonia. Proper head elevation during and after feedings is critical. **What Family Members Should Do If Something Goes Wrong:** - If the tube becomes dislodged or clogged, or if there is a significant amount of feed returning up the tube, they should stop the feeding and seek immediate medical assistance. - If the patient shows any signs of respiratory distress, they should call for help immediately. - If there are signs of infection or persistent discomfort, notify healthcare staff as soon as possible. **Emergency Response:** - Family members should know the emergency response protocol of the hospital. This includes how to quickly summon a nurse or doctor and what the contact points are in case of an emergency. - They should also be instructed on basic first aid responses, such as clearing the airway if the patient is choking and knowing CPR in case of respiratory or cardiac arrest. **General Care:** - Ensure good hygiene, and keep the insertion site clean, following any instructions given by the healthcare professionals. - Support the patient's overall comfort by checking for any signs of skin breakdown or irritations from the tube's tape or securement device. It's important for the healthcare team to provide proper training for family members who will be assisting with NG tube care. Family members should be given clear and simple instructions, perhaps illustrated guides or demonstrations, and opportunities to ask questions until they feel confident in the role they will need to play in the patient's care. It's also crucial that clear lines of communication are established between the family and the clinical staff, so that there is support readily available if an issue arises that the family cannot manage alone."},{"prompt":"Can you please translate your last message into mandarin Chinese for the family to print out and keep at the hospital bed","completion":"Certainly!

Ce sujet, à la croisée des chemins entre technologie de pointe et expression artistique, offre un terrain fertile pour de passionnantes discussions et réflexions. J'ai d'ailleurs hésité avec le thème de l'impact de l'IA sur l'emploi, mais l'universalité et l'aspect innovant de l'IA dans l'art ont finalement prévalu. **Étape 2: Sélection du sujet débat (30 secondes)** Parmi les nombreux débats soulevés par l'IA dans l'art, j'ai choisi de me concentrer sur la question de l'authenticité et de la créativité. Qu'est-ce qui définit une œuvre d'art ? Une IA peut-elle être véritablement \\"créative\\" ? Ces questions suscitent de vifs débats, accentués par des exemples récents comme les œuvres générées par les algorithmes de réseaux de neurones. **Étape 3: Prises de position (30 secondes)** Dans mon carnet de bord, j'ai noté plusieurs prises de position contrastées : des artistes qui considèrent l'IA comme un outil collaboratif, contre des critiques qui y voient une menace pour l'authenticité artistique. J'ai dû écarter certaines opinions plus marginales pour se concentrer sur les arguments les plus influents et les plus répandus. **Étape 4: Points de tension (1 minute)** Les points de tension sont nombreux : la question de l'auteur d'une œuvre ai-générée, le rôle de l'IA comme co-créateur ou simple outil, et les implications pour les droits d'auteur sont quelques-uns des débats houleux. Certaines personnes argumentent que l'IA dissout l'unicité et l'expression personnelle, tandis que d'autres estiment qu'elle élargit les horizons de la création. **Étape 5: Problématique (30 secondes)** La problématique principale est : \\"L'IA remet-elle en question le concept traditionnel d'art et de créativité, et si oui, comment la société doit-elle répondre à ce défi?\\" J'ai choisi cette problématique pour son actualité et sa capacité à susciter un dialogue constructif entre les différents acteurs concernés. **Étape 6: Qualification de controverse (30 secondes)** Cette problématique constitue une controverse car elle répond aux critères : il y a un conflit d'opinions, un public concerné, des acteurs diversifiés tels que des artistes, technologues, institutions culturelles et le grand public, ainsi que l'absence d'un consensus clair. *Conclusion (20 secondes)* À travers cette présentation des dimensions multiples de l'IA dans l'art, j'ai cherché à montrer comment les avancées technologiques interpellent nos convictions et invitent à redéfinir ce que nous comprenons par \\"art\\". **Anticipation de l'entretien** Je suis prêt à discuter en détails des points soulevés pendant l'oral et à répondre aux éventuelles questions du jury. Mes sources incluent des articles académiques, des interviews d'artistes et des débats publics sur le sujet. Je suis capable de nommer des acteurs clés comme les artistes utilisant l'IA, les développeurs de ces technologies, ainsi que des critiques et théoriciens de l'art.

Nó cho phép chúng ta cập nhật kiến thức của mình về một sự kiện dựa trên bằng chứng mới. Định lý Bayes được biểu diễn như sau: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) Trong đó: - P(A|B) là xác suất của sự kiện A đã xảy ra khi có thông tin B. - P(B|A) là xác suất của thông tin B đã xảy ra khi biết sự kiện A. - P(A) và P(B) là xác suất trước khi biết thông tin B. Ví dụ về việc sử dụng định lý Bayes là bài toán tiếp thị trực tuyến. Giả sử có một tỷ lệ người dùng truy cập vào một trang web và thực hiện một giao dịch là 5%. Bên cạnh đó, tỷ lệ spam email được gửi đến người dùng là 0,1%. Hãy giả sử bạn nhận được một email từ trang web đó, chứa một mã giảm giá cho giao dịch. Bạn muốn tính xác suất email này là spam nếu bạn nhận được mã giảm giá từ một người dùng. Để giải quyết bài toán này, chúng ta có thể sử dụng định lý Bayes: - P(Spam|Code) = (P(Code|Spam) * P(Spam)) / P(Code) Thông tin cho bài toán này như sau: - P(Spam) = 0.001 (tỷ lệ spam email) - P(Code|Spam) = 0.05 (tỷ lệ mã giảm giá trong email spam) - P(Code) = (P(Code|Spam) * P(Spam)) + (P(Code|Non-Spam) * P(Non-Spam)) = (0.05 * 0.001) + (0.0001 * 0.999) = 0.00005 + 0.0000999 = 0.0001499 Sau khi tính toán, ta được: - P(Spam|Code) = (0.05 * 0.001) / 0.0001499 = 0.00005 / 0.0001499 ≈ 0.333 (hoặc 33.3%) Vậy xác suất email này là spam, khi bạn nhận được mã giảm giá từ một người dùng, là khoảng 33.3%."},{"prompt":"cho ví dụ khác về kiểm định giả thuyết trong lĩnh vực y khoa","completion":"Ví dụ về kiểm định giả thuyết trong lĩnh vực y khoa là xác định hiệu quả của một phương pháp điều trị mới. Giả sử một nhóm nghiên cứu muốn kiểm tra xem liệu một loại thuốc mới có efephedm đối với bệnh nhân bị cảm cúm hay không. Giả thuyết h0 (giả thuyết không): Thuốc không có tác dụng chữa trị cảm cúm. Giả thuyết h1 (giả thuyết chính): Thuốc có tác dụng chữa trị cảm cúm. Nhóm nghiên cứu chọn ngẫu nhiên một nhóm bệnh nhân và chia làm hai nhóm: nhóm A và nhóm B. Nhóm A được điều trị bằng thuốc mới, trong khi nhóm B được điều trị bằng một phương pháp điều trị hiện có hoặc placebo. Sau một khoảng thời gian, nhóm nghiên cứu thu thập dữ liệu về tình trạng cảm cúm của cả hai nhóm. Dữ liệu này sẽ cho phép nhóm nghiên cứu kiểm tra giả thuyết h0 và h1. Sau khi thu thập dữ liệu, nhóm nghiên cứu sử dụng phân tích thống kê để kiểm tra sự khác biệt giữa hai nhóm. Cụ thể, họ sử dụng một bài kiểm định như bài kiểm định t Student để so sánh trung bình của hai nhóm. Nếu giá trị p (giá trị xác suất) thu được từ bài kiểm định nhỏ hơn một ngưỡng xác định, thì nhóm nghiên cứu có đủ bằng chứng để bác bỏ giả thuyết h0 và chấp nhận giả thuyết h1. Nếu giá trị p không nhỏ hơn ngưỡng, nhóm nghiên cứu không có đủ bằng chứng để bác bỏ giả thuyết h0 và không thể kết luận về hiệu quả của thuốc mới.

Nếu một người trong nhóm này được xét nghiệm dương tính cho bệnh Y (P(Y|Pos)), ta muốn tính xác suất người đó thực sự mắc bệnh Y dựa trên thông tin xét nghiệm. Áp dụng định lý Bayes, ta có: P(Y|Pos) = (P(Pos|Y) * P(Y)) / P(Pos) Trong đó: - P(Pos|Y) là xác suất xét nghiệm cho kết quả dương tính nếu người ta thực sự mắc bệnh Y (0.98). - P(Y) là tỷ lệ mắc bệnh Y trong nhóm (0.05). - P(Pos) là xác suất xét nghiệm cho kết quả dương tính, bất kể người đó có mắc bệnh Y hay không. Để tính P(Pos), ta cần tính tổng của hai trường hợp: kết quả xét nghiệm dương tính nhưng không mắc bệnh Y và kết quả xét nghiệm dương tính và mắc bệnh Y. P(Pos) = P(Pos|Y') * P(Y') + P(Pos|Y) * P(Y) Trong đó: - P(Pos|Y') là xác suất xét nghiệm cho kết quả dương tính nếu người ta không mắc bệnh Y (0.02). - P(Y') là xác suất người không mắc bệnh Y trong nhóm (1 - P(Y)). Sau khi tính toán, ta có: - P(Pos) = (0.02 * (1 - 0.05)) + (0.98 * 0.05) = 0.0196 + 0.049 = 0.0686 Và kết quả cuối cùng: - P(Y|Pos) = (0.98 * 0.05) / 0.0686 = 0.049 / 0.0686 ≈ 0.715 (hoặc 71.5%) Vậy xác suất người đó thực sự mắc bệnh Y khi xét nghiệm cho kết quả dương tính là khoảng 71.5%."},{"prompt":"hướng dẫn sử sụng SPSS để thực hiện tất cả kiểm định Bayesian","completion":"Hiện tại, SPSS không hỗ trợ trực tiếp cho các phép kiểm định Bayesian.

Luu Lee Jürna (Luu võib olla lühem variant nimest Luule) Tuleb tunnistada, et traditsiooniliste ühesilbiliste Eesti eesnimede leidmine võib olla keeruline ning sellised nimed ei pruugi alati kaasaegse nimetrendiga sobituda. Alternatiivina võite kaaluda variante, kus ametlik nimi on pikem, kuid igapäevaselt kasutatakse eesnime lühendit või hüüdnime, mis on ühesilbiline. Näiteks: 1.

Tii Lee Jürna (täisnimi Tiiu või Tiina) Pidage silmas, et levinud Eesti eesnimede hulgas võib olla keeruline leida rangelt ühesilbilist nime, mis vastaks nii ajaloolistele kui ka esteetilistele nõuetele.

Va (samuti haruldane ja võiks olla teise nime hüüd- või lühendatud vorm) Tavaliselt on sellised nimed võetud pikematest nimedest või hüüdnimedest. Sest paljud keeled ja kultuurid, sealhulgas eesti keel, on arendanud pikema kujuga nimesid.

Reet on samuti üsna lühike, kuigi see võib olla kahesilbiline, olenevalt kõneleja hääldusest või dialektist. Tuleb märkida, et tüüpiliselt kohtame eesti kultuuris kahesilbilisi nimesid.

Rappelez-vous de moduler votre temps en fonction des différentes étapes, en se concentrant davantage sur les étapes 3 et 4 qui forment le cœur de votre argumentation. **Étape 1: Contextualisation (30 secondes)** Bonjour, je suis ravi(e) de vous présenter aujourd'hui la question de la régulation de l'intelligence artificielle dans le domaine artistique. Ayant suivi un cursus en sciences du numérique, la manière dont l'IA influence et transforme nos sociétés me fascine, et plus particulièrement son impact sur la création artistique, un domaine traditionnellement humain. **Étape 2: Choix du sujet (30 secondes)** Dans le vaste domaine de l'IA, j'ai choisi de focaliser sur l'art car c'est où le dialogue entre technologie et créativité humaine est le plus frappant. Ces récentes années, l'émergence d'œuvres créées par l'IA a suscité un vif débat sur l'authenticité, le droit d'auteur et l'essence même de la créativité, ce qui a rendu ce sujet à la fois actuel et riche en discussions. **Étape 3: Prises de position (1 minute)** À travers mes recherches, j'ai identifié des acteurs clés tels que des artistes utilisant l'IA, des critiques d'art, des juristes et des philosophes. Certains argumentent que l'IA est une extension de la créativité humaine, tandis que d'autres craignent une dévalorisation de l'authenticité artistique. **Étape 4: Points de tension (1 minute 30 secondes)** Les points de tension sont nombreux. Il y a une inquiétude quant à la propriété intellectuelle : qui est le vrai créateur d'une œuvre d'art IA, la machine ou le programmeur ? De plus, l'impact économique sur le marché de l'art est non négligeable, avec des IA créant des œuvres en masse à faible coût. Il y a aussi des questions éthiques : la technologie risque-t-elle de supplanter l'expression humaine ou de permettre une nouvelle forme de création collaborative ? **Étape 5: Problématisation (30 secondes)** Ma problématique, \\"Faut-il réglementer l'intelligence artificielle dans l'art?\\" découle de ces questionnements. J'ai opté pour cette problématique car elle aborde non seulement des considérations légales et commerciales, mais aussi des questionnements philosophiques sur la nature de l'art. **Étape 6: Critères d'une controverse (30 secondes)** Est-ce une controverse ? Oui, étant donné la diversité des opinions et l'absence de consensus, cette question remplit les critères d'une controverse. Il y a un conflit manifeste entre valeurs culturelles, enjeux économiques et considérations légales. **Préparation pour l'entretien (à initier avant l'oral)** Pour être prêt(e) à discuter avec le jury : - Pouvoir citer au moins deux sources récentes, comme des articles de revues spécialisées dans l'art ou la technologie. - Connaître les arguments des acteurs mentionnés et pouvoir discuter de leur position de manière précise. - Maîtriser le vocabulaire spécifique à la fois de l'IA et de l'art. - Être à jour avec l'actualité autour de ce débat. Ce plan d'oral vous assurera de couvrir tous les aspects nécessaires pour mener une présentation équilibrée et informative sur le sujet de la régulation de l'intelligence artificielle dans l'art, et pour vous préparer à un entretien réussi avec le jury."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Install the REST Client plugin: Open VSCode and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the left sidebar or pressing \`Ctrl+Shift+X\`. Search for \\"REST Client\\" and install the plugin provided by Huachao Mao. 2. Create an OAuth2 client: Before setting up OAuth2, you need to create an OAuth2 client (also known as an OAuth2 application) in the service you want to authenticate with. Each service has its own way to create OAuth2 clients, so refer to the documentation of the service you are using to find the instructions specific to that service. 3. Configure the OAuth2 request: Open the \`.http\` file in VSCode where you want to make the OAuth2-authenticated request. At the top of the file (above the request you want to authenticate), you need to define the OAuth2 request by specifying the authorization URL, token URL, client ID, client secret, redirect URL, and other optional parameters. Here's an example of how it should look: \`\`\`http @oauth2 client_id = your_client_id client_secret = your_client_secret authorizationUri = your_authorization_url accessTokenUri = your_token_url redirectUri = your_redirect_uri scope = your_requested_scopes \`\`\` Replace the placeholders (\`your_client_id\`, \`your_client_secret\`, etc.) with the actual values from the OAuth2 client you created earlier. The \`scope\` parameter is optional and depends on the service. 4. Make the authenticated request: Now, you can make the authenticated request below the OAuth2 configuration. For example: \`\`\`http GET https://api.example.com/resource Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}} \`\`\` The \`{{access_token}}\` placeholder is automatically replaced by the OAuth2 extension with the obtained access token. 5. Initiate the OAuth2 flow: To initiate the OAuth2 flow and obtain the access token, use the \`POST\` request method with the special \`@oauth2\` symbol. For example: \`\`\`http POST https://oauth2.example.com/authorize Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded grant_type=client_credentials \`\`\` The \`grant_type\` parameter value depends on the service and the OAuth2 flow you are using. Refer to the documentation of the service you are using for the correct \`grant_type\` value. 6. Run the authenticated request: Save the \`.http\` file and send the request by either clicking the \\"Send Request\\" button in the upper right corner of the editor or using the \\"Send Request\\" command (\`Ctrl+Alt+R\`). The OAuth2 flow is now set up for the REST Client VSCode plugin, and you should be able to make authenticated requests to your desired service."},{"prompt":"please convert the below postman api from json to .http file which I can run in VS code rest client plug in.","completion":"Sure!

You should have the appropriate \`accessTokenUrl\`, \`client_authentication\`, \`clientSecret\`, \`clientId\`, \`grant_type\`, and \`addTokenTo\` properties defined. 2. Initiate the OAuth2 flow: To initiate the OAuth2 flow and obtain the access token, send a \`POST\` request to the URL specified in the \`accessTokenUrl\` property. In the body of the request, include the necessary parameters required by the OAuth2 provider to generate the access token. For example, using the provided configuration: \`\`\`http POST https://aiibcas-test.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded client_id=sb-AIIBCAS!t70524 client_secret=WYOFGzfucSTsP5UMaNXWcbgozN4= grant_type=client_credentials \`\`\` Adjust the parameters and URL accordingly based on your OAuth2 provider's requirements. 3. Send the request and obtain the access token: Execute the request using the REST Client extension by clicking the \\"Send Request\\" button or using the \\"Send Request\\" command. After a successful request, you will receive a response containing the access token. 4. Capture the access token: Look for the \`tokenName\` property in the response and capture the value of the access token. This value will be used in subsequent requests where you need to authorize with the OAuth2 provider. For example, if the response contains the access token like this: \`\`\`json { \\"tokenName\\": \\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c\\" } \`\`\` Copy the value \`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWI...\` and replace \`{{tokenName}}\` in your \`.http\` file with this value. You should now have the \`tokenName\` (access token) obtained and ready to be used in subsequent requests. Remember to include the \`Authorization: Bearer {{tokenName}}\` header in those requests (as shown in the previous converted \`.http\` file) to authorize with the OAuth2 provider."},{"prompt":"Can it be automatically done? I don't want to manual update the token","completion":"Yes, you can automate the process of obtaining and updating the access token in the \`.http\` file by using the REST Client extension's environment variables and dynamic value feature. Here's how you can achieve this: 1. Set up environment variables: Define an environment file (e.g., \`env.json\`) where you can store the access token. Create the file with the following content: \`\`\`json { \\"tokenName\\": \\"\\" } \`\`\` 2. Configure environment in the \`.http\` file: At the top of your \`.http\` file, define the environment file and set the initial value for the \`tokenName\` variable. \`\`\`http @set env=env.json @set tokenName= \`\`\` 3. Update the OAuth2 request: Modify your OAuth2 request to update the \`tokenName\` environment variable with the obtained access token. For example: \`\`\`http POST https://aiibcas-test.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded client_id=sb-AIIBCAS!t70524 client_secret=WYOFGzfucSTsP5UMaNXWcbgozN4= grant_type=client_credentials @set tokenName = {{response.body.tokenName}} \`\`\` In this example, the \`@set tokenName = {{response.body.tokenName}}\` line will update the \`tokenName\` environment variable with the actual access token from the response's body. 4. Automate access token retrieval: Add a \`Tests\` section to the request in your \`.http\` file. In the \`Tests\` section, you can write JavaScript code that extracts the access token from the response and updates the environment variable automatically. For example: \`\`\`http POST https://aiibcas-test.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded client_id=sb-AIIBCAS!t70524 client_secret=WYOFGzfucSTsP5UMaNXWcbgozN4= grant_type=client_credentials # Tests if (pm.response.code === 200) { pm.environment.set(\\"tokenName\\", pm.response.json().tokenName); } \`\`\` In this code snippet, if the response code is \`200\`, the environment variable \`tokenName\` will be updated with the \`tokenName\` value from the response. 5. Run the requests: Whenever you send the OAuth2 request, the tests will execute after receiving the response. If the response is successful, the environment variable \`tokenName\` will automatically be updated. 6. Use the access token in subsequent requests: In the subsequent requests where you need to include the access token, use the environment variable \`{{tokenName}}\`. For example: \`\`\`http GET https://api.example.com/resource Authorization: Bearer {{tokenName}} \`\`\` With this setup, the REST Client extension will handle updating the access token automatically, eliminating the need for manual token updates in the \`.http\` file."},{"prompt":"can you wrap everything in one .http file?","completion":"Certainly!

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house; the source of the returning woman's urge shouldn't be induced by illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance nor spicy food), for a very long comedic scene in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * An Asian American female youth (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a junior; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief and muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern as the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman ponders out loud about the odor again. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if the odor is coming from the returning woman. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. The present woman proceeds to sniff nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman rhetorically asks if the odor is a result of the returning woman pooping in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants and for how dirty pooping in her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so childish like pooping in her pants is inconceivable. The present woman proceeds to disappointedly ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and finished the whole bowel movement in her pants. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and push the poop into her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to release her bowels and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. The returning woman adds that she had to do this even if it meant that she would get everything out into her pants. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where she had to make the decision to push out a whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitance by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously taunt the returning woman for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop not because of special intention on her part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. This is all happening as the present woman is inspecting the bulge in returning woman's pants. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is inconceivably nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. The present woman continues by tauntingly admonishing the returning woman for pooping in her pants with what looked like the contentment of a child, and goes on by saying that the returning woman probably enjoys the odor emanating from her pants just like she enjoys having her pants be so full. Then, as she is still inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she remarks in resignation that based on the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by tauntingly scolding the returning woman for how terribly smelly the returning woman is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - childishly making the present woman have to put up with the returning woman’s smelly, soiled pants.","completion":"FADE IN: **INT.

Julie stares, transfixed by the scene, her mouth agape in confounded concern. **MAYA** (relieved whisper) So good... A conspicuous sound fills the air, followed by an unmistakable odor wafting into the entryway. Julie sniffs the air, her face contorting. **JULIE** (curious and disgusted) What is that smell? Maya meets her mother’s eyes, her expression sheepish, the act undeniable. **JULIE** (piecing it together) ...Is that smell coming from—? Silence from Maya, her eyes pleading for entry.

She gestures towards the bulky seat of her pants. **MAYA** And it was worth it for the relief. Julie feigns revulsion, her voice dripping with sarcasm. **JULIE** (mocking) Oh, you found relief, did you? Let’s see. Julie wheels Maya around, inspecting her daughter’s soiled condition. She taunts her. **JULIE** (teasingly) For someone so relieved, you sure did make a mess! Maya defends herself, her tone wavering between playful and embarrassed. **MAYA** (defensive) I had to! Too much pressure... Julie plays up her mock horror, dramatically speaking. **JULIE** (incredulous) Maya, you enjoy this, don't you? Maya cringes while Julie sniffs near her soiled pants, put on an exaggerated grimace. **JULIE** (exaggerating disgust) Ugh, how can you stand yourself? Maya concedes with a hint of humor. **MAYA** (resigned chuckle) It does stink a bit, doesn't it? Julie teases her further and ushers her towards the bathroom. **JULIE** (mockingly) It stinks a lot! Let's get you cleaned up! Julie humorously assists Maya as they head towards the bathroom, both performing a delicate dance to keep any remnants from spilling. **EXT.

Признаки — это индивидуальные характеристики или атрибуты, извлеченные из текстовых данных, представляющие собой важные аспекты данных для анализа или предсказания. Feature storage важен по нескольким причинам: 1. **Эффективность**: Хранение признаков должно быть осуществлено таким образом, чтобы обеспечивать быстрый доступ и изменение. Это может включать использование определённых баз данных, файловых систем или распределённых хранилищ. 2. **Переиспользование**: Если признаки уже извлечены и хранятся, их легче переиспользовать для различных моделей, что сокращает время обработки и вычислительные затраты на повторное извлечение признаков. 3. **Масштабируемость**: Система хранения должна быть способна масштабироваться, чтобы справляться с возрастающим объёмом данных. 4. **Версионирование**: Возможность отслеживать изменения в признаках, которые со временем могут эволюционировать в процессе оптимизации моделей. В рамках NLP, признаки могут включать в себя слова, фразы, темы, семантические и синтаксические структуры, а также числовые преобразования, такие как векторы, полученные с помощью методов, таких как TF-IDF, word2vec, GloVe или BERT embeddings.

Some of her best-known and most notable movies include: 1. **Clueless (1995)** - This is perhaps Silverstone's most iconic role, where she plays Cher Horowitz, a wealthy and superficial high school student who undergoes a journey of personal growth. The film is a cult classic and was a hit among audiences and critics. 2. **The Crush (1993)** - In this psychological thriller, Silverstone plays a teenage girl named Adrian Forrester who becomes obsessed with an older man who has moved into her family's guest house. 3. **Batman & Robin (1997)** - Although the movie was not particularly well-received by critics, it is noteworthy for Silverstone's role as Batgirl/Barbara Wilson. It has a significant place in her filmography as a big-budget Hollywood production. 4. **Blast from the Past (1999)** - In this romantic comedy, Silverstone plays Eve, a modern-day woman who meets a man (played by Brendan Fraser) who has spent his entire life in a fallout shelter. 5. **Excess Baggage (1997)** - Silverstone stars alongside Benicio Del Toro in this road trip film about a rich girl who stages her own kidnapping to get her father's attention but ends up actually getting kidnapped by a car thief. 6. **The Babysitter (1995)** - This thriller features Silverstone in the title role as a teenager who is the object of fantasy for the men around her, leading to a series of events that spiral out of control. 7. **Beauty Shop (2005)** - Although it is more of a supporting role, Silverstone plays a stylist in a beauty shop run by Queen Latifah's character. The film is a spin-off of the \\"Barbershop\\" series. 8. **Vamps (2012)** - Reuniting with \\"Clueless\\" director Amy Heckerling, Silverstone plays a vampire in modern-day New York in this comedy film. It's important to note that personal preferences among viewers can vary significantly, so \\"best\\" is subjective. Some may consider her breakthrough performance in \\"Clueless\\" her very best, while others may appreciate her work in more serious dramatic roles or other comedies."},{"prompt":"git 本地分支 有54 个commits ， 远程分支有56个commits ，为什么 还是提示有56个commits 可以拉取的 是什么问题 ？ 怎么解决","completion":"当你在Git中看到提示本地分支比远程分支少了一定数量的提交（commits），可能存在几种情况： 1. **本地分支落后于远程分支**： - 这是最常见的情况，意味着自从你上次更新（fetch或pull）本地分支以来，远程分支有新的提交被推送（push）上来了。因此，你的本地分支需要同步这些更改。 2. **分支点不同**： - 你的本地分支和远程分支可能是基于不同的提交（commit）进行的。也就是说，两个分支的历史可能在某个时刻分叉了，导致即使你推送了新的提交，远程分支的历史仍然包括了额外的提交。 3. **远程分支被别的贡献者更新**： - 如果远程仓库是多人协作的，可能有其他人推送了新的提交到远程分支，所以你的本地存储库与远程存储库不同步。 如果提示你有56个提交可拉取，意味着从当前的本地分支的头，到远程分支的头之间有56个提交差异。这并不一定表示所有这56个提交都是别人推送的；其中一些可能是你已提交但尚未推送到远程的。需要注意的是，如果你在本地分支进行了合并操作，合并提交本身也可能导致提交数目的差异。 为了解决这种情况，你可以执行以下步骤： 1. 更新你的本地仓库： \`\`\`sh git fetch origin \`\`\` 这个命令会获取远程分支的最新状态，但不会自动合并到你的工作目录中。 2. 检查分支差异： \`\`\`sh git log HEAD..origin/your-branch-name \`\`\` 替换\`your-branch-name\`为你的远程分支名，这个命令会显示本地分支与远程分支之间的差异。 3. 合并远程分支到本地分支： \`\`\`sh git merge origin/your-branch-name \`\`\` 或使用拉取命令（拉取是获取并合并的快捷方式）： \`\`\`sh git pull origin your-branch-name \`\`\` 这将会把远程分支的更改合并到你的本地分支上。 4. 如果出现冲突，你需要手动解决这些冲突，并完成合并过程。 5. 推送本地分支的更改，如果需要的话： \`\`\`sh git push origin your-branch-name \`\`\` 遵循这些步骤应该可以帮助你解决本地分支与远程分支同步的问题。不过，在处理这些步骤之前，最好确保你对当前的工作区域和暂存区都是清晰的，避免出现不期望的合并影响你的工作。"},{"prompt":"card 有一个关联字段 skill。怎么关联字段中的attack。和health 和 cost。更新 card的。attack 和 health 和cost ，帮忙写一下。关联表是 cards_skill_links","completion":"为了向您提供更具体的帮助，需要对您提到的数据结构有更多的了解。但是基于您提供的信息，我可以给出一个大致的SQL更新语句范例，假定您的数据库是SQL类型的（如MySQL），并假定您的 \`cards\` 表和 \`cards_skill_links\` 表的结构如下： - \`cards\` 表 - \`id\` – 卡牌唯一ID - \`attack\` – 攻击值 - \`health\` – 健康值 - \`cost\` – 费用值 - \`cards_skill_links\` 表 - \`card_id\` – 关联到\`cards\`表的卡牌ID - \`skill_id\` – 技能唯一ID - \`attack\` – 技能的攻击值 - \`health\` – 技能的健康值 - \`cost\` – 技能的费用值 如果您想要基于\`cards_skill_links\`表中的数据来更新\`cards\`表的\`attack\`、\`health\`和\`cost\`字段，您将需要执行一条更新（UPDATE）语句，并通过内部连接（INNER JOIN）来匹配两个表。以下是SQL语句的一个范例： \`\`\`sql UPDATE cards INNER JOIN cards_skill_links ON cards.id = cards_skill_links.card_id SET cards.attack = cards_skill_links.attack, cards.health = cards_skill_links.health, cards.cost = cards_skill_links.cost WHERE cards.id = {特定卡牌的ID}; \`\`\` 这个SQL命令将会用\`cards_skill_links\`表中的\`attack\`、\`health\`和\`cost\`字段的值更新\`cards\`表中相应卡牌的对应字段。 请把 \`{特定卡牌的ID}\` 替换为您想要更新的卡牌的实际ID。如果您想要为所有卡牌更新这些字段，您可以移除\`WHERE\`子句。 在执行任何更新操作之前，请确保备份您的数据库，以防任何意外发生。 **注意**：上述语句只是基于您的描述提供的一种可能性。具体实现需要根据实际的数据库结构、列名和业务逻辑来调整。如果某些列名或逻辑与您的数据库不符，请按照实际情况进行修改。如果您的数据库不是关系型数据库（比如MongoDB等NoSQL数据库），您会需要使用不同的查询语法来实现更新操作。"},{"prompt":"card。和 skill 是两个表 ，他们通过 cards_skill_links 表关联，修改下代码","completion":"了解到 \`card\` 和 \`skill\` 确实是通过一个关联表 \`cards_skill_links\` 相连的情况下，我们通常需要注意以下几点： 1. \`card\` 表有独立的字段包括 \`id\`, \`attack\`, \`health\`, 和 \`cost\`。 2. \`skill\` 表也有相应的字段，可能包括 \`attack\`, \`health\`, 和 \`cost\`。 3. \`cards_skill_links\` 表至少包含两个字段，\`card_id\` 和 \`skill_id\`，这些字段分别是 \`card\` 表和 \`skill\` 表的外键。 假设我们想要更新\`card\`表中的\`attack\`、\`health\`和\`cost\`字段，以反映与之关联的\`skill\`表中相应的值。SQL语句可能如下所示： \`\`\`sql UPDATE card INNER JOIN cards_skill_links ON card.id = cards_skill_links.card_id INNER JOIN skill ON skill.id = cards_skill_links.skill_id SET card.attack = skill.attack, card.health = skill.health, card.cost = skill.cost WHERE card.id = {特定卡牌的ID}; \`\`\` 在这里，我们首先根据\`card_id\`将\`card\`表和\`cards_skill_links\`关联起来，然后再与\`skill\`表根据\`skill_id\`进行关联。通过这种方式，我们可以访问\`skill\`表中关于攻击力、生命值和消费的信息，并将这些信息更新到\`card\`表中相应的记录上。 请确保替换 \`{特定卡牌的ID}\` 为你想要更新的卡牌的实际ID值。如果你想对所有的卡牌进行更新，那么可以移除 \`WHERE\` 子句并且执行更新，它将会影响到所有通过\`cards_skill_links\`表关联了技能的卡牌。 **重要**：在运行任何更新操作之前，请确保对数据库进行备份以防止任何数据丢失或意外更改。此外，这个SQL命令只是一个指导性的例子。具体的SQL命令将需要根据您所使用的数据库系统和实际的表结构来调整。如果您对如何构建这个SQL命令没有信心，或者不确定表结构，请在尝试之前咨询您的数据库管理员或数据库开发人员。"},{"prompt":"我要更新所有的卡。修改下代码","completion":"如果您想要更新所有的卡牌信息，以反映与之关联的技能表中的相应值，那么您可以移除 WHERE 子句以使 SQL 语句影响所有相关的卡牌。以下是修改后的代码： \`\`\`sql UPDATE card INNER JOIN cards_skill_links ON card.id = cards_skill_links.card_id INNER JOIN skill ON skill.id = cards_skill_links.skill_id SET card.attack = skill.attack, card.health = skill.health, card.cost = skill.cost; \`\`\` 这条 SQL 语句将会检索每张卡牌与其关联的技能，然后从技能表中获取 \`attack\`、\`health\` 和 \`cost\` 的值，并更新相应卡牌的这些字段。 **注意：** - 请确保您理解了这个操作会更新所有卡牌的数据，这可能导致大量数据的变化。 - 在执行前备份数据库，以便在发生错误或者不满意的更改时可以进行回滚。 - 上面的 SQL 语句适用于大多数 SQL 数据库（如 MySQL，PostgreSQL，SQL Server 等）。 如果您使用的是不同类型的数据库系统（比如 Oracle，SQLite 等），语法可能会有些许差异。 - 如果您的 \`skill\` 表不包含直接的 \`attack\`、\`health\`、或 \`cost\` 字段，而是需要计算或转换，您可能需要在设置部分调整 SQL 语句的内容。 在执行 SQL 更新操作时，通常建议先使用 SELECT 语句来检查即将进行的更改是否如预期： \`\`\`sql SELECT card.id, card.attack AS current_attack, card.health AS current_health, card.cost AS current_cost, skill.attack AS new_attack, skill.health AS new_health, skill.cost AS new_cost FROM card INNER JOIN cards_skill_links ON card.id = cards_skill_links.card_id INNER JOIN skill ON skill.id = cards_skill_links.skill_id; \`\`\` 这条 SELECT 语句将帮助您预览即将执行的更新，确保它们是正确的，之后再运行 UPDATE 语句。"},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief and muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern as the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman ponders out loud about the odor again. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if the odor is coming from the returning woman. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. The present woman proceeds to sniff nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman rhetorically asks if the odor is a result of the returning woman pooping in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants and for how dirty pooping in her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so childish like pooping in her pants is inconceivable. The present woman proceeds to disappointedly ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and finished the whole bowel movement in her pants. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and push the poop into her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to release her bowels and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. The returning woman adds that she had to do this even if it meant that she would get everything out into her pants. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where she had to make the decision to push out a whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitance by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously taunt the returning woman for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop not because of special intention on her part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. This is all happening as the present woman is inspecting the bulge in returning woman's pants. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is inconceivably nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. The present woman continues by tauntingly admonishing the returning woman for pooping in her pants with what looked like the contentment of a child, and goes on by saying that the returning woman probably enjoys the odor emanating from her pants just like she enjoys having her pants be so full. Then, as she is still inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she remarks in resignation that based on the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by tauntingly scolding the returning woman for how terribly smelly the returning woman is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - childishly making the present woman have to put up with the returning woman’s smelly, soiled pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY A bustling street in a middle-class neighborhood of Mumbai. People, rickshaws, and street vendors create a colorful mosaic of daily life.

The house nameplate reads \\"SHARMA.\\" ANJALI SHARMA (25), an unassuming college student with neatly tied hair, glasses, and a salwar kameez, is speed-walking towards the door. Her face is taut with discomfort. Flashback to EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - EARLIER Anjali's collegiate event ran long due to an unforeseen debate that she passionately participated in. Too engrossed, she ignored her rising urge, and now it’s caught up to her. Back to INT. FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Struck by panic, Anjali PATS HER POCKETS, her movements frenzied. No key. She KNOCKS on the door with increasing desperation. Silence. Her face twists, the pressure mounting. The sound of shuffling feet within. Someone approaches the other side of the door. MRS. SHARMA (50s), dressed in a traditional sari, her hair streaked with gray but vibrant, inquires. MRS. SHARMA (O.S.) Kaun hai? (Who's there?) ANJALI Maa, main hu! Jaldi kholo! (Mom, it's me! Open up quickly!) The unlocking of the door is agonizingly slow. Anjali shifts from foot to foot. MRS. SHARMA, perplexed, opens the door. Anjali blurs past her. MRS. SHARMA (alarmed) Kya hua, beta? (What's wrong, child?) But Mrs. Sharma GRABS Anjali's arm in concern. ANJALI (pleading) Bas, side ho jaao, Maa! (Just move aside, Mom!) They BICKER unintentionally. Mrs. Sharma's care causes obstruction. MRS. SHARMA Anjali, batayegi kya hua? (Anjali, will you tell me what's wrong?) ANJALI Kuch nahi hai, bas mujhe andar jaane do! (Nothing, just let me in!) ANGUISH crosses Anjali's face; she GROANS softly, overtaken by the urge. Mrs. Sharma's grip SLACKENS. MRS. SHARMA (confused) Tu theek to hai na? (Are you okay?) Retreating slightly, Anjali assumes a discrete yet convenient posture. She PUSHES, a symphony of relief and effort escaping her. ANJALI (muttering) ...bahut accha lag raha hai... ( ...it feels so good...) Mrs. Sharma watches, befuddled, as Anjali continues, caught between euphoria and necessity. SNIFFING uneasily, Mrs. Sharma's face contorts, realization dawning. MRS. SHARMA (disgust and disbelief) Yeh badbu... tere se aa rahi hai? (This stench... is it coming from you?) Silence from Anjali, mortified. Mrs. Sharma SNIFFS closer to Anjali, reeling from the odor. MRS. SHARMA (pointed) Anjali! Tune apne kapde gande kar diye? Abhi...? (Anjali! You soiled your clothes? Just now...?) Anjali, eyes averted, implores Mrs. Sharma to step aside again. Mrs. Sharma relents with disgust, ushering her in. Anjali gingerly waddles in, cupping the seat of her pants. MRS. SHARMA Ruko! Kuch gir gaya to? (Wait! What if something falls?) Anjali FREEZES, sheepish. MRS. SHARMA (taunting) Itni gandi harkat? Samajh me nahi aata... tu badi kab hogi? (Such a dirty deed? I can't understand... when will you grow up?)

Must have felt as good as a toddler enjoying it, right?) Anjali, COYLY PROTESTING, looks back at her mother. ANJALI Bas zarurat thi, Maa... bahut pressure tha... (It was just necessary, Mom... there was so much pressure...) Mrs. Sharma, CONTEMPTUOUSLY stating the obvious. MRS. SHARMA (reproachful) Ye sab harkatein nahi chalengi, Anjali.

Pour commencer, permettez-moi de poser la scène. Lorsque nous pensons à l'art, nous imaginons souvent des peintres avec leurs pinceaux ou des sculpteurs œuvrant sur la pierre, mais aujourd'hui, un nouvel acteur s'invite dans le processus de création artistique : l'IA. L'intelligence artificielle est cette capacité des machines à effectuer des tâches qui, traditionnellement, nécessiteraient l'intelligence humaine. Et c'est ici que les choses deviennent intéressantes pour l'art. L'IA, à travers différentes applications et algorithmes, commence à générer des œuvres qui non seulement imitent l'esthétique humaine mais aussi proposent de nouvelles formes d'expression artistique. Mais comment cela fonctionne-t-il, vous demandez-vous peut-être? Eh bien, l'IA en art s'appuie généralement sur des réseaux de neurones artificiels, qui sont entraînés avec d'énormes volumes de données artistiques. Par exemple, on peut nourrir un système avec des milliers d'images de peintures de la Renaissance. Après une phase d'apprentissage, l'IA peut commencer à produire ses propres images dans le style appris, créant des œuvres originales qui reflètent les caractéristiques de l'époque. Mais il y a plus. Avec les progrès de la technologie, l'IA ne se limite pas à imiter. Elle est maintenant capable d'expérimenter avec des abstractions, des compositions inédites, et même des formes d'art que nous, en tant qu'humains, nous n'avions pas envisagées. Prenez, par exemple, le projet Google Magenta, qui cherche à comprendre si les machines peuvent être créatives. Ou encore, l'artiste IA nommé AICAN, qui a réalisé des œuvres présentées comme étant psychédéliquement innovantes et qui ont été exposées dans des galeries d'art à travers le monde. Mais là où cela devient véritablement captivant, c'est dans la collaboration entre l'IA et l'artiste humain. Cette symbiose peut mener à des explorations et des créations qui transcendent ce que l'artiste ou la machine pourraient accomplir seuls. Il y a une sorte de dialogue qui s'établit entre l'homme et la machine, où chacun apprend de l'autre, entraînant des résultats stupéfiants. Cependant, cette convergence soulève également des questions d'éthique et de propriété intellectuelle. Qui est le véritable créateur de ces œuvres ? Comment valorisons-nous l’aspect technique par rapport à l’inspiration humaine ? Et surtout, l'IA changera-t-elle notre perception de la créativité et de l'originalité ? Pour conclure, l'IA dans l'art n'est pas seulement une tendance émergente ; elle est en train de redéfinir les frontières de la créativité et de nous pousser à repenser notre relation avec la technologie. Que nous soyons artistes, amateurs d'art ou simples curieux, l'IA nous interpelle et nous invite à explorer de nouveaux horizons expressifs. Merci de votre attention, et j'ai hâte de discuter avec vous de cette fusion fascinante entre l'art et l'intelligence artificielle."},{"prompt":"Confronting the challenge of the outbreak of COVID-19 should sharpen our focus on global drug access as a key issue in antiviral therapy testing. The testing and adoption of effective therapies for novel coronaviruses are hampered by the challenge of conducting controlled studies during a state of emergency. The access to direct antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin, that have an existing inventory and reliable supply chain may be a priority consideration for therapies developed for the 2019-nCoV infection outbreaks and any strain variants that may emerge. On the basis of the direct antiviral activity of ribavirin against 2019-nCoV in vitro and evidence for potency enhancement strategies developed during the prior SARS and MERS outbreaks, ribavirin may significantly impact our ability to end the lingering outbreaks in China and slow outbreaks in other countries. The apparent COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to follow dosage guidelines for treatment with ribavirin, test new therapeutic concepts, and conduct controlled testing to apply the scientific rigor required to address the controversy around this mainstay of antiviral therapy. 翻译一些上面的内容","completion":"面对COVID-19疫情的挑战，我们应当将全球药物获取作为抗病毒治疗测试的关键问题来重点关注。在紧急状态下进行受控研究的挑战阻碍了对新型冠状病毒有效疗法的测试和采用。直接抗病毒药物，如利巴韦林，具有现有库存和可靠的供应链，可能是针对2019-nCoV感染爆发和可能出现的任何毒株变异的治疗方案的优先考虑因素。基于利巴韦林对2019-nCoV的体外直接抗病毒活性以及在先前SARS和MERS爆发期间发展的增强药效策略的证据，利巴韦林可能对我们结束中国持续爆发并减缓其他国家爆发的能力产生重大影响。明显的COVID-19大流行提供了一个机会，按照利巴韦林治疗的剂量指南，测试新的治疗理念，并进行受控测试，以应用解决围绕这种抗病毒治疗的争议所需的科学严谨性。"},{"prompt":"The wide availability and low cost of ribavirin support its potential to significantly impact the treatment of nCoV infections. The challenges in the evaluation of ribavirin efficacy from 2003 during SARS and the 2013 MERS outbreaks led to a summary evaluation of its utility as controversial in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A large number of clinical studies and retrospective analyses that will come from the 2019-nCoV outbreak will put the controversy of ribavirin efficacy in a broader context. For ribavirin and myriad other treatments, both the clinical results and quality of evidence will reveal the challenges that face frontline physicians who treat patients in a medical setting and evaluate prophylaxis for novel high-risk environments formed by large quarantined populations. The critical need for treatment and patient care in outbreak settings, on the frontlines of nCoV outbreaks, will place stress on any medical system and clinical research mechanism. However, controlled clinical studies are underway to permit a prospective evaluation of efficacy, and the government Treatment Plan Edition 5 and revised and prescribed usage guidelines distributed in China will assist in the comparability of multicenter experiences in retrospective analyses.

In the first three published case series of 2019-nCoV treatment (total of 180 cases Wuhan, China; 1 case WA), no patients have reportedly been treated with ribavirin.12, 50, 51 However, the announcement of new clinical studies will offer new evidence of the role of ribavirin in clinical practice for 2019-nCoV8-12 (Table 1). Although significant effort and resources are contributed to the research and development of nCoV treatments, in times of outbreak, care and preparation are required to apply a scientific approach to quantify the therapeutic benefit of medicines that are already available during such viral outbreaks. On the basis of these prior clinical experiences and others, controlled studies are underway to evaluate the available courses of therapy for COVID-19. Among the possible studies that should be completed are drug combinations that use the widely available ribavirin.52 Encouraging signals for the well-documented antiviral ribavirin are the demonstration of in vitro antiviral activity toward the WIV04 strain of 2019-nCoV, its well-established management of side effects, and the potential for lower dosing, based on treatment synergies.5 In the face of this public health emergency, we are mindful of the risk of a deluge of clinical trials that may impact the recruitment and evaluability of prospective research. The public good requires that patients can access life-saving treatments for infectious diseases in an affordable and timely fashion. Access to medical products and establishing their therapeutic benefit are both essential to meet this obligation. Effective clinical treatments prepared from the existing pharmacopoeia can save many lives and achieve the greatest benefit for the public while facing the challenge of 2019-nCoV and future nCoV strains. 翻译上面的内容","completion":"根据《协和方案》第5版，中国政府最初建议在中国的2019-nCoV肺炎诊断中使用利巴韦林，即在确诊肺炎后，应给予4克的口服负荷剂量，然后每8小时口服1.2克的剂量。然而，这一指导后来被修改为在修订的第5版中，采用500毫克IV BID或TID的剂量。尽管这些信息可能会根据新的证据进行更新，以提供指导，但MERS方面的先前经验可以帮助我们理解如何加强利巴韦林对nCoV的药效，并通过开具低剂量和高剂量疗法来延伸潜在益处。在最早发表的三个2019-nCoV治疗案例系列（共180例来自中国武汉，1例来自华盛顿）中，没有报道患者接受了利巴韦林治疗。然而，新的临床研究的宣布将提供关于利巴韦林在临床实践中对2019-nCoV的作用的新证据。 尽管在nCoV治疗的研究和开发方面投入了大量的努力和资源，但在爆发期间，需要做好护理和准备工作，以科学的方法量化已有药物在此类病毒爆发期间的治疗效益。基于这些先前的临床经验以及其他经验，目前正在进行受控研究，评估COVID-19的已有治疗方案。其中应该完成的可能研究包括使用广泛可用的利巴韦林的药物联合方案。值得鼓励的是，已有大量证据表明利巴韦林具有抗病毒活性，且其对WIV04株的2019-nCoV具有体外抗病毒活性，其副作用管理有良好的掌握并且有低剂量治疗可能性，基于治疗协同作用。面对这次公共卫生紧急事件，我们意识到临床试验的洪水可能影响到前瞻性研究的招募和可评估性。 为了公共利益，患者能够以负担得起且及时的方式获得治疗传染病的救命药物是必要的。获取医疗产品并确立其治疗效益是满足这一义务的两个关键因素。从现有的药典制备出的有效临床治疗方案可以挽救许多生命，并在面对2019-nCoV和未来的nCoV毒株挑战时获得最大的效益。"},{"prompt":"Describe past world was capitalist","completion":"In the past, the world was predominantly capitalist. Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of resources and means of production, with individuals and businesses operating for profit. This system values free market competition, where prices, wages, and production are determined by supply and demand. During this era, governments played a limited role in regulating markets, and businesses had the freedom to pursue their own self-interests and maximize profits. Entrepreneurship and innovation flourished, driving technological advancements and economic growth. Goods and services were produced and distributed based on the principles of supply and demand, allowing consumers to make choices based on their preferences and purchasing power. The capitalist world saw the rise of industrialization and the expansion of global trade. With increasing access to resources and markets, countries competed to secure favorable trade partnerships and establish colonies to exploit resources and expand their markets. This period marked significant advancements in transportation, communication, and production processes, leading to higher standards of living for many people. The capitalist world also witnessed the growth of multinational corporations, as businesses sought to expand their operations globally. Trade was facilitated by the establishment of international organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to regulate trade practices and promote economic cooperation worldwide. However, the capitalist system was not without its flaws and criticisms. Critics argue that capitalism leads to income inequality, with wealth concentrated in the hands of a few while many struggle to meet their basic needs. They claim that the pursuit of profit often comes at the expense of workers' rights, environmental sustainability, and social welfare. Overall, the past capitalist world was characterized by economic growth, technological advancements, and global trade. While it provided opportunities for prosperity and progress, it also raised concerns about inequality and the social and environmental costs of unregulated markets."},{"prompt":"yazımı düzenleyip yeniden verir misin. ----------------------------------------Proje Amacı: Çat Köyü’nü sosyal, ekonomik ve çevresel anlamda yeniden canlandırmak.

Kültürel mirasın korunması ve tanıtılmasının, köylüler arasındaki aidiyet duygusunu güçlendirerek, köye özgü bir kimliği pekiştireceği öngörülmektedir. Ayrıca, çevresel sürdürülebilirlik çabalarının, ekonomik büyümeyi teşvik edeceği ve ekoturizm yoluyla köy için yeni gelir kaynaklarının oluşturulacağı tahmin edilmektedir. Projeyle köylülere yönelik geliştirilecek girişimcilik eğitimleri ve köye geri dönüş yapan kişilere sunulacak çeşitli imkanlar, yerel ekonominin kalkınmasına katkıda bulunacaktır. Genç nesillerin kırsalda yaşama ve çalışma olanağını artırma potansiyeline sahip eğitim ile araştırma programları sayesinde, köyün demografik yapısının yeniden canlandırılması ve yeni kuşakların köy yaşamını benimsemeleri beklenmektedir. Sulak alanların tarımsal üretim için daha etkin kullanılması, yerel gıda güvenliğini iyileştirecek ve çeşitliliği artıracaktır. Gelişmiş sulama teknolojileri ve sürdürülebilir tarım yöntemleriyle hem tarımsal verimliliğin artırılması hem de su kaynaklarının korunarak doğal dengenin muhafaza edilmesi umulmaktadır. Ekoturizm ve eğitime yönelik faaliyetlerin desteklenmesi, köy ekonomisine farklılık katacak ve çevre bilincinin artmasına vesile olacaktır. Sonuç itibarıyla, projenin başarılı bir şekilde hayata geçirilmesi, Çat Köyü’nü geçmişin mirasıyla donatılmış, geleceğe açık bir toplum olarak konumlandırabilecektir. Bu sayede köy, sürdürülebilir bir yaşam biçimi benimseyen, tarımsal ve ekolojik açıdan zenginleşen ve bilgiyle yeşeren bir topluluğa dönüşebilecektir."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

Capitalism is characterized by concepts such as private ownership of resources, production for profit, and competition. In the past capitalist world, businesses were owned and operated by individuals or groups of investors who aimed to generate revenue and accumulate wealth. The means of production, such as factories and machinery, were predominantly owned by private entities who hired workers to produce goods and services. Competition was a fundamental aspect of capitalism. Businesses competed with one another to attract customers and maximize their profits. This drive to outperform competitors often led to innovations, advancements in technology, and lower prices for consumers. Additionally, individuals had the freedom to pursue their own economic interests, including starting their own businesses and entering into various industries. The government's role in the capitalist world was typically limited, primarily focusing on ensuring fair competition, protecting property rights, and enforcing contracts. However, government regulations and interventions varied among different countries and time periods. Income distribution in this capitalist era was characterized by a significant wealth gap. While some individuals and businesses prospered, others faced economic inequality and struggled to meet their basic needs. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few often led to social and economic disparities. The past capitalist world was also marked by periods of economic expansion and recession. Cycles of boom and bust were common, with periods of rapid economic growth followed by downturns and recessions. These cycles were often influenced by factors such as market demand, investor sentiment, and government policies. Overall, Era 1 was defined by a capitalist economic system where private ownership, profit motive, and competition were the driving forces behind the world's economies. While this system brought economic growth and innovation, it also contributed to income inequality and economic instability."},{"prompt":"Era 2: Describe today world was orwellian capitalist","completion":"In Era 2, the world can be described as an Orwellian capitalist society, drawing inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel \\"1984.\\" In this world, capitalism has taken on a more authoritarian and oppressive form, with significant control and surveillance imposed by the ruling class, amplified by advanced technology. In an Orwellian capitalist society, the government and a handful of powerful corporations exercise extensive control over the economy and the lives of individuals. Private ownership of resources and means of production still exists, but the concentration of wealth and power is highly centralized and controlled by a few elite entities. One of the defining features of this era is pervasive surveillance. Advanced technologies, such as surveillance cameras, facial recognition, and data tracking systems, are used extensively by the government and corporations to monitor and control the population. Privacy is severely limited, as individuals are under constant surveillance, leading to a sense of constant scrutiny and fear. The government plays a dominant role in regulating and manipulating the economy. There is a fusion of political and economic power, with government officials working closely with corporations to shape the market and control resources. Economic decisions are made based on political agendas, rather than the needs and desires of the people. In an Orwellian capitalist society, propaganda and controlled media are used to manipulate public opinion and maintain the status quo. News and information are heavily censored and distorted to serve the interests of those in power. Dissenting voices and independent media outlets are suppressed, creating a climate of fear and limited access to alternative viewpoints. Income inequality is exacerbated in this era, with a small ruling class enjoying immense wealth and privilege, while the majority of the population struggles to make ends meet. Social mobility is limited, as power and resources are concentrated in the hands of a few, who use their influence to maintain their positions of dominance. Additionally, in an Orwellian capitalist society, consumerism and commercialization are prevalent. Consumer culture is encouraged as a means to distract and pacify the population. People are encouraged to constantly buy and consume, bringing profits to the ruling elite and perpetuating a culture of materialism. Overall, the world in Era 2 is characterized by an oppressive and authoritarian form of capitalism, where the ruling class exercises extensive control over the economy, media, and individuals' lives. Surveillance, propaganda, and income inequality are prominent features, creating a society that resembles the dystopian vision depicted in George Orwell's \\"1984.\\""},{"prompt":"Era 3: Describe future world after capitalist","completion":"In Era 3, the world has moved beyond capitalism and entered a new phase of societal and economic organization. This future world, which can be described as post-capitalist, has evolved in response to the shortcomings and challenges presented by capitalism. While the specifics of this era may vary, some common themes and characteristics can be envisioned. In the post-capitalist world of Era 3, the focus has shifted from profit-driven motives to a more holistic approach that values sustainability, social well-being, and the equitable distribution of resources. The traditional capitalist model of ownership and exploitation has given way to new models that prioritize collective ownership, cooperation, and shared prosperity. One key aspect of this future world is a heightened emphasis on social and environmental responsibility. The negative externalities of rampant consumption and resource exploitation in the capitalist era are recognized and addressed through sustainable practices. Environmental preservation, renewable energy, and ecological balance are prioritized, with efforts made to mitigate the damage caused by past capitalist practices. Economic systems in Era 3 are more participatory and democratic. Decision-making power and ownership of resources are distributed more equitably among individuals and communities, reducing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. Cooperative models, employee ownership, and community-driven initiatives play a significant role in shaping the economy. Technology and automation have advanced significantly in this future era, leading to shifts in the nature of work and productivity. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation are harnessed to augment human capabilities and relieve individuals from monotonous and labor-intensive tasks. Universal basic income or similar mechanisms may be implemented to ensure that individuals have access to a minimum standard of living, even with reduced traditional employment opportunities. Collaboration and cooperation are key principles embraced in the post-capitalist world. Instead of the cutthroat competition of the capitalist era, there is a focus on collective problem-solving and working together for the betterment of society. Sharing of knowledge, open-source development, and collaborative innovation are widespread, allowing for greater progress and societal advancements. In this future world, societal well-being takes precedence over material accumulation. Education, healthcare, and social services are universally accessible and of high quality. The pursuit of personal development, creativity, and human flourishing becomes central, with individuals and communities thriving in a more balanced and fulfilling way. While the specifics of a post-capitalist world in Era 3 may differ, these general characteristics suggest a departure from the profit-driven nature of capitalism and a shift towards a more inclusive, sustainable, and socially responsible economic and social system. It represents a vision of a future world that addresses the shortcomings and inequalities associated with capitalism while striving for a more equitable, harmonious, and prosperous society."},{"prompt":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 主力底部震荡，拿住了 2024-01-24 13:32:34 就这在怎么空？空狗己斩。 2024-01-24 16:14:10 把狗骗出来杀 2024-01-24 15:51:36 广联达股价连续3日创近6年新低 2024-01-24 15:39:37 啥时候能长到18块？ 2024-01-24 15:37:38 盲猜底价8.5 2024-01-24 15:26:56 各位大神16块多的本有机会回本吗 2024-01-24 15:19:09 我13.25刚割了肉，你既然翻红，我KKKKKK 2024-01-24 14:55:54 师姐18.3已建仓广联达 2023-10-30 17:23:40 我忽然发现，仅1月，它跌了近20个点，反弹还这么弱....... 2024-01-24 14:59:28 赚钱啦，明天14见 2024-01-24 15:02:29 涨不动，继续跌吧 2024-01-24 14:47:16 睡觉真耽误事，这个b夜班上的 2024-01-24 14:45:14 等你 2024-01-24 14:38:54 成本14.5春节之前，可以解套吗？ 2024-01-24 14:15:25 泄了吗？ 2024-01-24 14:20:37 每天都是阴跌，大盘涨你爹，大盘跌你还是跌，所有软件，服务还是收年费，这个董事长可 2024-01-24 13:48:10 呀！这么冷的天天天唱凉凉[快哭了] 2024-01-24 13:04:22 下周开始买入广联达 2024-01-20 17:58:37 广联达今年有没有机会跌倒7元左右，一个大坑 2024-01-24 10:37:19 下星期一低开低走必须的 2024-01-20 14:26:13 14.2都跌破了，不知道怎么搞了。等k值＜10才能补 2024-01-24 13:29:22 23跌到19的时候跑了，当时就觉得这股下跌没头 2024-01-24 13:28:31 割肉盘出尽了吧 2024-01-24 13:26:55 不要抗了。 2024-01-24 13:22:36 不要抗了 2024-01-24 13:21:30 强者恒强 2024-01-24 11:34:03 卖不完根本卖不完，你想买股票，他想卖公司 2024-01-24 13:03:59 w个 2024-01-24 13:03:19 操，昨天被我出了手贱啊 2024-01-23 09:17:26 假回购真套现，坑完员工坑股民，十天就有九天跌，每天活在日线下 2024-01-24 10:52:49 单边下跌不止，脑袋正常的都不会碰，有一天被某坏大师骗进一天，第二天我及时止损了！ 2024-01-24 10:30:38 我是看懂门道了：大盘跌它跟着跌，大盘涨它跟着涨1%，然后连着几天跌2%-3%[呲 2024-01-24 12:02:17 尾盘抄底待涨 2024-01-24 11:09:41 跑路吧！已经看不到底线了 2024-01-24 11:59:30 大胆做t就是。 2024-01-24 09:36:37 亏损50% 2024-01-24 11:49:16 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-01-22 14:46:13 13块5明显有护盘 2024-01-24 10:23:19 垃圾 2024-01-24 11:28:45 真真假假，假假真真，看戏看戏，精彩精彩。 2024-01-24 11:04:52 12 2024-01-24 10:54:57 好公司不是一天练成的，关注广联达第8年了，广联达解决好当下问题，还能回来 2024-01-24 10:36:25 没有主力，也没游资进场，别上当受骗 2024-01-24 10:38:28 明天再看一天，如果还在13.5左右就是底部洗盘了，如果破13.3果断割肉离场。不 2024-01-24 10:37:46 记住本大师14块5看坚决看多的，看主力还能砸多少！反转酝酿中 2024-01-24 07:31:10 死拉几，天天跌 2024-01-24 10:20:30 指数小跌我大跌，指数大涨我小跌。 2024-01-24 10:01:03 百年后必涨 2024-01-24 10:18:32 套了我3万多，拿去发奖金吧 2024-01-23 14:22:39 不要激动，跌久了总要喘口气的，气喘了，继续下跌。。 2024-01-23 10:43:46 我也比你亏的多 2024-01-24 09:36:00 垃圾里面的垃圾 2024-01-24 09:33:22 广联达：融资净买入373.05万元，融资余额4.39亿元（01-23） 2024-01-24 08:56:49 世界潮流，无比强大动力将推动科技不断上涨 2024-01-17 08:37:26 割肉换股，这东西等下去睫毛得白了 2024-01-23 19:23:01 18块钱的本，不知道何年才能解套 2024-01-23 19:04:09 下周下周可以翻转 2024-01-23 18:55:12 广联达建筑造价软件（关联房地产） 2024-01-19 16:46:04 广联达股价连续2日创近6年新低 2024-01-23 15:43:43 早就说了，这行情，每天t几毛，大盘你们觉得可能直接拉上去吗？底部3000以下起码 2024-01-23 15:17:57 大盘跌2个点它跌6个，大盘涨1个它涨一个，什么玩意儿。 2024-01-23 14:30:34 两点半开始干活啦 2024-01-23 14:27:14 上市公司广联达陷清零员工奖金传闻南都记者注意到，近日，多位网友在社交媒体上爆料称 2024-01-10 21:18:11 没救了？ 2024-01-23 09:33:51 今天半天的量能这么大，看来还是没跌透 2024-01-23 11:21:53 起袖子加油干!往死里干! 2024-01-23 11:15:37 来看热闹 2024-01-23 11:11:14 继续奏乐！ 2024-01-23 11:05:13 跌1元涨6分...... 2024-01-23 10:47:23 昨天每股亏0.73，今天涨一毛不到，你牛逼 2024-01-23 10:42:34 2024明星股[哭] 2024-01-23 10:42:01 今儿能不能破15？ 2024-01-05 09:19:11 开盘直接满仓 2024-01-23 10:24:02 13.75清仓。 2024-01-23 10:07:26 见好收 2024-01-23 10:03:52 板块涨，这个货色竞然还……[怒][哭][滴汗] 2024-01-23 09:41:57 当自强啊 2024-01-23 09:36:29 这是买广联达的兄弟，已经注销账户了。。。[哭][哭][哭] 2024-01-23 09:26:04 就xumu入了一百股都亏[大笑]还咋玩啊[微笑] 2024-01-23 09:21:11","completion":"总结： 1. 对广联达股票的评价存在分歧，有人认为是主力底部震荡，拿住了；有人抱怨广联达股价连续创新低。 2. 一些人对广联达股票的未来表现持乐观态度，希望股价能够回升并实现盈利。 3. 也有人对广联达股票的下跌表示失望和愤怒，称其为垃圾，认为是一个大坑。 4. 一些人建议割肉离场，认为股价继续下跌。 5. 也有人对广联达股票持观望态度，认为尚未见底。 6. 有人对广联达公司的经营策略和股价表现表示疑问，认为公司存在问题。 7. 一些人对融资情况进行关注，认为融资买入金额增加。 8. 有人表达了对广联达公司的失望和对亏损的愤怒。 9. 也有人对广联达公司进行了肯定，认为是好公司，并预测股价可能会回升。"},{"prompt":"I want you to write a screenplay/shooting script for a scene. Please include every event and dialogue that I describe as part of the scene's prompt sequence in the final output, and combine all the events and dialogues that I provide in the following part of my prompt into one whole screenplay/shooting script that is coherent, logically consistent and that flows naturally. Please ensure that the scene, its contents and the interactions within it develop organically and realistically in the final output.

The way in which the characters speak needs to be derived from their character traits, their cultural backgrounds and the scene's genre conventions. Please elaborate in detail on all events and dialogues that occur during the entirety of the scene. None of the dialogues and descriptions of events in the screenplay/shooting script should be truncated. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house; the source of the returning woman's urge shouldn't be induced by illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance nor spicy food), for a very long comedic scene in a Brazilian Telenovela TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief and muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern as the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman ponders out loud about the odor again. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if the odor is coming from the returning woman. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. The present woman proceeds to sniff nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman rhetorically asks if the odor is a result of the returning woman pooping in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants and for how dirty pooping in her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so childish like pooping in her pants is inconceivable. The present woman proceeds to disappointedly ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and finished the whole bowel movement in her pants. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and push the poop into her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to release her bowels and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. The returning woman adds that she had to do this even if it meant that she would get everything out into her pants. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where she had to make the decision to push out a whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitance by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously taunt the returning woman for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop not because of special intention on her part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. This is all happening as the present woman is inspecting the bulge in returning woman's pants. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is inconceivably nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. The present woman continues by tauntingly admonishing the returning woman for pooping in her pants with what looked like the contentment of a child, and goes on by saying that the returning woman probably enjoys the odor emanating from her pants just like she enjoys having her pants be so full. Then, as she is still inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she remarks in resignation that based on the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by tauntingly scolding the returning woman for how terribly smelly the returning woman is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - childishly making the present woman have to put up with the returning woman’s smelly, soiled pants.","completion":"**EXT.

APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – DAY** *Now, as she approaches the door, she hurriedly digs through her sling bag, with increasing panic.* **INSERT: ISABELA'S SLING BAG** *Inside her bag, we see a cluster of everyday items: a jumbled heap of keys, but the one she needs is notably absent.* **BACK TO SCENE** *She frantically pats down her pockets, but there's no sign of the key. Without options, Isabela knocks on the door – at first polite, but her knocks quickly turn urgent as the seconds drag on.* *A moment passes, dragging out to feel like an eternity. No answer. Isabela’s urgency turns to desperation; she knocks louder, almost pounding the door with her closed fist.* *Suddenly, a voice calls from within, muffled by the wooden barrier.* **CLAUDIA (O.S.)** (in Portuguese) Who is it? Why all this racket? **EXT. APARTMENT DOOR – CONTINUOUS** *Isabela’s eyes widen; she paces in small, frantic circles.* **ISABELA** (barely holding composure) Mãe, it's Isabela! Hurry, please! *Keys jingle from the other side — a drawn-out symphony to Isabela's ears as she grimaces, clutching her stomach.* *At last, the door starts to open to reveal CLAUDIA, a woman of undeniable elegance despite her age, early 60s. Her hair is a streak of silver amidst dark waves, and her outfit is chic but comfortable – a testament to her taste. An expression of worry and confusion is etched on her face.* **CLAUDIA** (concern washing over her) Isabela, dear, what’s the—? *Without a word, Isabela makes a break for the interior. But Claudia, her motherly instincts in overdrive, reacts instantly by reaching out to steady her daughter.* **ISABELA** (strained voice) Just move, I need to get past! *Their collision becomes an awkward dance as Claudia grips Isabela's arm, drenched in concern.* **CLAUDIA** (forehead creasing) Tell me what’s wrong? *Isabela wrestles against the hold, a symphony of pleas escaping her lips.* **ISABELA** (desperation seeping through) Mãe, let go — it's urgent! *In that precise moment, something stirs; a look of sheer mortification sweeps across Isabela's features as a soft groan escapes her.* **CLAUDIA** (shock painting her face) Isabela?! *Isabela's expression shifts abruptly from distress to shock and untimely relief. Her mother’s grasp loosens as her face twists in befuddlement.* *This allows Isabela to retreat just a few steps, albeit awkwardly adopting a stance that surrenders to the situation, squatting slightly.* **CLAUDIA** (bewildered) What in the world are you—? **ISABELA** (muttering with a deep exhale, a tinge of satisfied resignation) Can't... can't stop it now... *Claudia observes her daughter with a mix of bewilderment and a growing notion of what’s happening.* **CLAUDIA** (disbelief creeping into her tone) Isabela, is there...? *Isabela, now bent forward, continues under her breath with each exertion, a strange combination of distress and relief, all while maintaining the embarrassing posture.* **ISABELA** (voice hushed and strained, intermittent with soft grunts) It’s... actually a relief... Aii... *Claudia stands frozen, concern slowly morphing into realization, her nose wrinkles as she sniffs the air, discerning the odor shielded by confusion.* **CLAUDIA** (taking another sniff, her face scrunching) What’s that smell? *Isabela, her poise crumbling, meets her mother's gaze with a sheepish and mortified look.* **CLAUDIA** (smelling again, resolve hardening) Oh, no... Isabela, did you...? *Only silence answers her. Claudia hesitantly draws nearer, sniffing more intently now, her senses assaulted by the unmistakable stench.* **CLAUDIA** (voice rising, coated with disbelief) You didn't... in your pants...? *Isabela replies with a downward gaze, muttering softly.* **ISABELA** (ashamed) Can I just—walk on? **CLAUDIA** (exhales, stepping aside with a mix of disgust and impatience) Fine, but be very careful! *Isabela gingerly begins her awkward waddle into the house, hands defensively cupping the seat of her pants.* **CLAUDIA** (halting Isabela, her face a mix of concern and reprimand) Wait, not a step further! We don’t want... any accidents on the floor. *Isabela stops short, her shame morphing into a silent statue, cupping her spoiled attire.* **CLAUDIA** (pointed tone) This is unbelievable! When will you act your age, Isabela? *At Claudia’s admonishment, Isabela sheds her layered mortification, her voice playfully reproachful.* **ISABELA** (slightly teasing, yet still embarrassed) If you hadn’t taken forever to open up, this wouldn’t have happened! **CLAUDIA** (crossing her arms, accentuating each word) That's not an excuse for an adult, Isabela! E terminou tudo em suas calças, minha filha! *Isabela's eyes soften with mock regret, her tone laced with sly defiance.* **ISABELA** (adamantly) I was desperate, Mãe. The need was... overwhelming. I had to let go! *Claudia stands arms akimbo, giving her daughter’s attire a sidelong glance, shaking her head in feigned shock.* **CLAUDIA** (scoffing) And that makes it acceptable? To soil yourself? *Isabela casts her gaze downward, gingerly patting the bulge in her pants with distaste, yet not without a hint of sardonic relief.* **ISABELA** (voice peppered with self-conscious amusement) Regardless, it did feel... liberating, somehow. **CLAUDIA** (raising a brow, her reprimand laced with sarcasm) Liberating? There’s nothing liberating about this mess! *Clapping her hands in mock encouragement, Claudia gestures for her daughter to turn around.* **CLAUDIA** (cynically) Let me see the result of this so-called liberation. *Isabela shuffles slowly, turning her back to Claudia with reluctance.* **CLAUDIA** (voice drips with incredulity) Look at this... it's... you're full of it! You must be so proud. **ISABELA** (timidly defensive) It's... not about pride. It just... happened. *Hands still cupping, her eyes looking empty yet thoughtful, she tries to convey both her embarrassment and the necessity of her actions.* **CLAUDIA** (tutting, the mock in her tone still evident) Such an unbelievable mess. You relished it, clearly! *As Claudia leans in for a closer inspection, Isabela stands stiff, cringing from the close scrutiny.* **CLAUDIA** (voice holding a balance of taunt and concern) It might as well have pleased you, the way you're talking! *Claudia takes a deep breath, approaching her nose to the seat of Isabela's pants, exaggeratedly wrinkling her face as if inspecting a mischievous child. Isabela squirms under her mother's nose, discomfort clear on her face.* *With an audible inhale, Claudia pulls back, grimacing, hand covering her nose.* **CLAUDIA** (complaining loudly) This stench! Como você fede, Isabela! *Isabela acquiesces, her head nodding slightly, her voice layered with resignation.* **ISABELA** (softly conceding) I know... given the circumstances, it's expected. *Claudia follows with a stern lecture, her tone blending mockery and genuine chiding.* **CLAUDIA** (direct and firm) We're fixing this now. You can’t stay like this – it's unbearable! *Instructing Isabela with animated gestures, Claudia beings ushering her daughter one step at a time toward the bathroom, both of them careful to contain any fallout.* **ISABELA** (murmuring with a cringe) I can feel it... threatening to, ah, escape... *Claudia reinforces her steady hand on her daughter's back, her other hand pinching her nose, her complaints constant and vocal.* *They reach the bathroom, Isabela stops at the threshold, feigning contemplation.* **ISABELA** (teasing, a playful sparkle in her eye) Maybe you'd like to change my 'diaper,' Mãe? *Claudia, her incredulity peaking, playfully pushes her daughter forward, squashing the mess exaggeratedly, making a show of her exasperation.* **CLAUDIA** (voice sharp with mock sternness) Inside, agora! And pode tirar esse rabo sujo! *Isabela yelps as she stumbles forward, her complaint genuine.* **ISABELA** (disgustedly stunned) Ahh, it's spreading... inside! *The bathroom door swings shut behind Isabela; Claudia stands outside, her expression a blend of aggravation and affection.* **CLAUDIA** (keeping her hand over her nose, firm but caring) That's for being cheeky. And never test your mãe like that again! *Claudia marches away, grumbling to herself but not without a hint of a smirk peeking through.* **CLAUDIA** (to herself, shaking her head) Every day a new lesson with this one... My dear, when will you learn? *Her chuckles blend with the São Paulo street noise as she leaves.* **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"已知每条数据的format如下： {'inputs': 'Write a shared memo with Erinnerungsfunktion.', 'targets': 'Create_note ( note_feature « Erinnerungsfunktion » note_shared_status « shared » )', 'metadata': {'locale': 'en-US', 'example_id': '7944ad456a82a4af350b902ee0ee2ecfa8ee2e032a0e9d6c080f8e16e7c43a8e', 'seeded_lists': [{'name': 'Aldi', 'items': ['taco shells', 'turkey']}, {'name': 'mall', 'items': ['Gucci bag']}], 'seeded_notes': [{'name': 'pay my bills', 'content': ''}, {'name': 'todo', 'content': 'call the pet vet'}, {'name': 'pack the charger', 'content': ''}], 'seeded_contacts': ['Jack', 'Young', 'Dana', 'Timmy', 'Katie'], 'previous_turns': [{'user_query': 'Set a task called garbage', 'response_text': 'Got it, do you want to add time?'}], 'linguistic_phenomena': 'code-mixing', 'split': 'dev', 'context': 'synthetic'}} 这类数据被储存在一个名为code_mixing_data的列表中。 写一段代码调用GPT的api，批量处理code_mixing_data中的数据。 利用这些数据共同分析一下两个问题： 1.

'inputs'与('previous_turns'，'response_text')的关系：你可以通过参考\`previous_turns\`和\`inputs\`查找模式，看是否'inputs'受到'previous_turns'的影响。如果API回复的正确性与'previous_turns'有关，可能要检测'previous_turns'是否确实能够提供上下文环境，并评价其对于模型回复的重要性。 2. code-mixing出现的规律：你可能需要在处理数据时加入自然语言处理的技术，比如POS标签分析、依存关系解析等，来查看code-mixing倾向于出现在句子的哪些部位（名词、动词等），它们是否与特定的句法结构相关联。 在以上代码模板的基础上，需要结合具体的API调用、自然语言处理工具和分析逻辑来完成你的目标。因为数据结构比较复杂，可能还需要进行一系列数据清洗和转换的步骤。"},{"prompt":"Ho","completion":"Hello!

Seniot bir architect veya CEO olarak, bu prensipleri anlatırken şu şekilde yaklaşabilirim: 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Tek Sorumluluk Prensibi: Bu prensip, her sınıfın veya bileşenin yalnızca bir sorumluluğa sahip olması gerektiğini söyler. Yazılımda her bir bileşenin veya sınıfın tek bir işlevi gerçekleştirmesi, daha kolay anlaşılabilir, sürdürülebilir ve değiştirilebilir kodlar üretmeye yardımcı olur. Örneğin, bir iş sınıfının hem veritabanına erişim hem de iş mantığını kontrol etmeye çalışması yerine, bu görevleri ayrı sınıflara ayırmak SRP'yi uygulamak olacaktır. 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP) - Açık/Kapalı Prensibi: Bu prensip, yazılım bileşenlerinin genişletilmeye açık, ancak değişikliklere kapalı olması gerektiğini belirtir. Bileşenlerimizi tasarlarken, gelecekte yeni gereksinimler eklendiğinde veya değiştirildiğinde, mevcut kodları değiştirmek yerine yeni kodlar ekleyebilmeliyiz. Bunu yapmanın bir yolu, arayüzler veya soyut sınıflar kullanarak bileşenlerimizi esnek ve açık hale getirmektir. 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Liskov Yerine Geçme Prensibi: Bu prensip, bir bileşenin, onu kullanan diğer bileşenlerle tam olarak yer değiştirebilmesi gerektiğini ifade eder. Yani, bir alt sınıf, üst sınıfın yerine geçtiğinde sistemin çalışmasını etkilememelidir. LSP'ye uymak için, soyutlamalar ve genellemeler kullanarak sınıf ilişkilerini düzgün bir şekilde organize etmeliyiz. Bu, bir sınıfın veya bileşenin kullanıcıları için beklenen davranışı sergilemesini ve hiyerarşi içinde tutarlı olmasını sağlar. 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Arayüz Ayırımı Prensibi: Bu prensip, mümkün olduğunda mümkün olduğu kadar az sayıda özelliği içeren özelleştirilmiş arayüzlerin yazılmasını tavsiye eder. Bir bileşen, yalnızca ihtiyaç duyduğu özelliklere sahip bir arayüzü uygulamalıdır. Aksi takdirde, gereksiz bağımlılıklara neden olabilir ve karmaşık hale gelebilir. İSP, kodu daha az bağımlı ve daha okunaklı hale getirerek, bir bileşeni gereksinimlere yönelik kesin olarak tasarlamamıza yardımcı olur. 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - Bağımlılığı Ters Çevirme Prensibi: Bu prensip, bileşenler arasındaki bağımlılığı azaltarak esnek ve genişletilebilir bir sistem oluşturmayı hedefler. Yüksek seviyeli modüller, düşük seviyeli modüllere bağlı olmamalıdır. Bunun yerine, her iki seviyenin de soyutlamalara ve arayüzlere bağlı olması gerekmektedir. Bu, bileşenlerin daha kolay test edilmesini, değiştirilmesini ve yerini almasını sağlar. Bu SOLID prensiplerini uygulamak, yazılım projelerinde daha temiz, esnek ve sürdürülebilir kodlar üretmemizi sağlar. Hem işletmelerin hem de yazılım mühendislerinin, bu prensiplere önem vermesi ve kod kalitesini artırmak için bu ilkeleri takip etmesi önemlidir."},{"prompt":"güzel","completion":"Teşekkür ederim! SOLID prensipleri, yazılım geliştirmedeki en iyi uygulamaları takip etmek için önemli bir yol haritası sağlar. Bu prensipleri takip ederek, daha temiz, sürdürülebilir ve genişletilebilir bir kod tabanı oluşturabiliriz.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"please explain what is f(a,b)=","completion":"The notation f(a, b) typically refers to a function, denoted by f, that takes two inputs or arguments, denoted by a and b. The function f maps the pair of inputs (a, b) to a single output, which is the value of f at (a, b). The function f can represent any kind of relation between the inputs and the output, depending on the context and definition of the function. For example, if f(x, y) = x + y, then f(a, b) would mean \\"add a and b together.\\" If a = 2 and b = 3, then f(a, b) = f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.

configuration.setHostName(\\"localhost\\"); configuration.setPort(6379); // 假设根据租户动态指定数据库索引 configuration.setDatabase(getTenantDatabaseIndex()); return new LettuceConnectionFactory(configuration); } private int getTenantDatabaseIndex() { // 实现获取当前租户对应的数据库索引的逻辑 // 这里返回的索引需要根据当前请求或者上下文中识别的租户动态获取 return TenantContextHolder.getTenantId(); } } \`\`\` 在使用\`RedisTemplate\`或其他Redis操作类时，确保指向正确的\`LettuceConnectionFactory\`。 # 方式二：通过key命名策略 另一种方式是为每个租户的keys添加一个特定的前缀。这种方式不限于数据库索引的限制，并且能够在任何Redis服务上工作。 \`\`\`java @Configuration public class RedisConfig { @Bean public RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate(LettuceConnectionFactory connectionFactory) { RedisTemplate<String, Object> template = new RedisTemplate<>(); template.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory); template.setKeySerializer(new StringRedisSerializer() { @Override public byte[] serialize(String string) { // 添加租户前缀到每个key return super.serialize(TenantContextHolder.getTenantId() + \\":\\" + string); } }); // 设置其他的序列化器（例如，值的序列化器） template.setValueSerializer(new GenericJackson2JsonRedisSerializer()); return template; } } \`\`\` 在这个例子中，我们使用\`TenantContextHolder.getTenantId()\`来获取当前的租户ID（通过线程本地变量或者请求上下文获取），并且添加到key的前缀上。 这要求你拥有一个能够在请求中识别租户ID，并且存储到可以在应用程序中随处访问的地方的机制，比如在Spring Security的上下文中、在HTTP的Session中或者一个ThreadLocal变量中。 使用key前缀的好处是你不需要为每个租户配置不同的Redis实例，所有的数据都在同一实例中，但是通过key的前缀来逻辑隔离不同的租户数据。 不管采用哪种方式，实现多租户都需要你在应用级别维护租户上下文，并且在同一实例的操作中添加逻辑以区分不同的租户。"},{"prompt":"springboot 多租户同时访问时 切换数据源受影响吗","completion":"在Spring Boot应用程序中实现多租户数据源切换涉及到动态地在不同租户的请求之间切换数据源。如果正确实现，应用程序可以安全地在不同租户之间进行切换而不受彼此干扰。然而，确实存在一些潜在的问题和挑战： 1. **上下文保持**：确保在每次请求中都维护了正确的租户上下文，并且在整个请求处理流程中始终使用正确的数据源。 2. **线程局部存储**：Spring通常使用线程池来处理有状态的请求，意味着线程会被重用。务必在请求结束时清理线程局部存储的租户信息，避免租户信息泄漏到后续的请求。 3. **事务管理**：在事务性操作期间，必须确保不会更改数据源。如果在事务中切换数据源，可能会导致数据一致性问题。 4. **并发和竞态条件**：在多线程环境中，特别是当多个请求几乎同时到达并且可能属于不同的租户时，保证在设置租户上下文时不会产生竞态条件是重要的。 要处理这些问题，可以使用以下策略： - **请求作用域的租户标识**：在请求开始时确定租户标识，并将其保存在请求作用域中，以确保在处理请求的整个生命周期中都有一个常量的租户标识。可以使用Spring的\`@RequestScope\`注解或单独的租户上下文持有者来实现。 - **AbstractRoutingDataSource**：Spring提供了\`AbstractRoutingDataSource\`，用于基于查找键动态切换数据源。它可以配合上下文持有者使用，根据当前的租户标识来确定使用哪个数据源。 - **ThreadLocal清理**：在\`Filter\`或\`Interceptor\`中，确保每次请求完成时清理\`ThreadLocal\`变量，避免潜在的信息泄漏。 下面是一个简单的\`AbstractRoutingDataSource\`使用示例，说明如何在多租户应用程序中选择数据源： \`\`\`java public class TenantRoutingDataSource extends AbstractRoutingDataSource { @Override protected Object determineCurrentLookupKey() { // 获取当前请求关联的租户标识 return TenantContextHolder.getTenantId(); } } \`\`\` TenantContextHolder可能是一个拥有静态方法\`getTenantId\`返回当前线程的租户ID的类。它可能使用\`ThreadLocal\`存储租户ID。 在配置\`DataSource\`时，你需要设置\`AbstractRoutingDataSource\`的目标数据源，并指定默认的数据源。 \`\`\`java @Bean public DataSource dataSource() { TenantRoutingDataSource routingDataSource = new TenantRoutingDataSource(); Map<Object, Object> targetDataSources = new HashMap<>(); // 填充targetDataSources映射，键是租户ID，值是对应的DataSource实例 routingDataSource.setTargetDataSources(targetDataSources); routingDataSource.setDefaultTargetDataSource(defaultDataSource);

// Constructor injection of the template public MessageProducer(RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate) { this.rabbitTemplate = rabbitTemplate; } public void sendToTenantQueue(String tenantId, String message) { rabbitTemplate.convertAndSend(\\"exchange\\", \\"routingKey\\", message, m -> { m.getMessageProperties().setHeader(\\"tenantId\\", tenantId); return m; }); } } \`\`\` 在这个例子中，生产者在发送消息时设置了一个头部信息 \`tenantId\`。 消费者只处理分配给它们的租户消息： \`\`\`java public class MessageConsumer { @RabbitListener(queues = \\"queueName\\") public void receiveMessage(Message message) { String tenantId = message.getMessageProperties().getHeader(\\"tenantId\\"); if (TenantContext.getCurrentTenant().equals(tenantId)) { // 处理消息 } else { // 忽略或重新排队消息 } } } \`\`\` 在这个例子中，消费者首先检查消息的租户ID，只有当它与当前上下文中的租户ID匹配时，才会处理消息。 实现多租户消息队列时，你需要面对以下问题： - 消息顺序：特定租户的消息看起来可能是有序的，但在多租户队列中可能会被打乱。 - 性能开销：过滤和路由消息可能增加延迟。 - 租户之间错位消费：必须确保消息严格只在适当的租户间消费。 这些因素使得设计一个可靠的多租户消息处理系统变得更加复杂，但通过遵循上述策略和实践，你可以构建出一个合理的解决方案满足业务需求。"},{"prompt":"多租户 不同数据库， redis解决方案","completion":"在多租户应用中，租户通常是指使用同一套应用架构但是拥有各自隔离数据的不同客户。对于数据库来说，多租户通常意味着每个租户有自己的数据库实例或者一个共享的数据库但是数据通过租户ID隔离。对Redis这样的缓存系统来说，也可以使用相似的概念。以下是Redis在多租户架构中可用的一些策略： # 方案一：使用数据库（DB）索引 Redis支持多个数据库（例如，在默认配置下从db0到db15），您可以选择根据租户ID将每个租户指定给一个Redis数据库索引。这种方法的限制是，每个Redis实例可用的数据库数量是固定的，并且一些托管Redis解决方案可能不支持使用多个数据库。 # 方案二：租户特定的key前缀 另一个更灵活的方法是在每个key前面加上租户ID作为前缀来区分不同租户的数据。这种方法的优点是不受数据库数量的限制，并可适用于任何类型的Redis部署环境。 例如： \`\`\` tenant1:user:12345 tenant2:user:12345 \`\`\` 这里，\`tenant1\`和\`tenant2\`指代两个不同的租户。在每个操作中，您需要确保使用正确的key来存取数据。 # 方案三：逻辑分隔符 您可以在设计数据模型的时候使用一种逻辑分隔符来分隔不同租户的数据。例如，可以在key中加入一个特定字段作为分隔符，或者在存储在Redis中的数据结构中加入租户ID作为一个字段。 # 方案四：单独的Redis实例 如果预算允许，每个租户使用单独的Redis实例是最简单、最安全的隔离方式。这种方式下，每个租户都拥有自己的独立缓存环境，彼此完全隔离。 # 实现示例 下面是一个使用租户特定key前缀的简单示例： \`\`\`java @Component public class RedisTenantAwareCache { private final RedisTemplate<String, Object> redisTemplate;

try { // 提前准备异常处理逻辑，确保租户信息始终清理 final String tenantId = httpRequest.getHeader(\\"X-Tenant-ID\\"); if (tenantId != null) { TenantContextHolder.setTenantId(tenantId); } else { // 或者设置一个默认的租户ID，或者拒绝请求 // throw new TenantNotFoundException(\\"Tenant ID not found in request header\\"); } chain.doFilter(request, response); // 继续执行链 } finally { // 清除租户信息 TenantContextHolder.clear(); } } // 其他方法(...) } \`\`\` # 示例：获取租户ID时提供默认值 \`\`\`java public class TenantContextHolder { private static final ThreadLocal<String> currentTenant = new ThreadLocal<>(); public static String getTenantId() { String tenantId = currentTenant.get(); if (tenantId == null) { // 提供默认值或者抛出一个异常 tenantId = \\"defaultTenant\\"; } return tenantId; } // 其他方法(...) } \`\`\` 确保在所有相关的点调用\`TenantContextHolder.setTenantId()\`和\`TenantContextHolder.clear()\`，并在设计架构时考虑到整个系统的多租户上下文管理。"},{"prompt":"this.socket = new WebSocket('ws://39.99.158.180:9613/web-api/webSocket/print_'+randomParam); 如何给websocket 添加header","completion":"WebSocket协议（RFC 6455）本身不支持在建立WebSocket连接时直接发送自定义Header。因此，如果你需要在使用原生WebSocket API时发送附加的信息，如认证标识或其他头部信息，通常会采用以下几种策略： # 1. 查询参数 最直接的方法是在WebSocket URL中使用查询参数来传递额外的信息： \`\`\`javascript const randomParam = \\"12345\\"; const param1 = \\"value1\\"; const param2 = \\"value2\\"; this.socket = new WebSocket(\`ws://39.99.158.180:9613/web-api/webSocket/print_{randomParam}?param1={param1}&param2={param2}\`); \`\`\` 这种方法适用于某些不敏感的数据，但不建议用于传递敏感信息，如认证令牌。 # 2. 通过子协议 当创建WebSocket对象时，可以指定一个或多个子协议： \`\`\`javascript const protocols = \\"my-subprotocol\\"; this.socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket', protocols); \`\`\` 如果服务端支持，这可以作为确定客户端使用的特定协议类型的方式。 # 3. 先进行HTTP请求 在打开WebSocket连接之前，可以先发送一个HTTP(S)请求，其中可以设定所有需要的自定义Header。服务器端验证这个HTTP请求，并在成功后返回一个一次性的token或者session ID，客户端随后在WebSocket连接URL中使用这个信息： \`\`\`javascript // 发起HTTP请求获取token fetch(\\"http://39.99.158.180:9613/web-api/getWebSocketToken\\", { headers: { // 自定义Header \\"Authorization\\": \\"Bearer your-token\\", } }) .then(response => response.text()) .then(token => { this.socket = new WebSocket(\`ws://39.99.158.180:9613/web-api/webSocket/print_{randomParam}?token={token}\`); }) .catch(error => console.error(\\"Error in fetching token:\\", error)); \`\`\` 在这个方法中，WebSocket服务器验证URL中的查询参数来鉴权。 # 4. Cookie 如果WebSocket服务和你的Web服务在同一域名下，你可以在发起WebSocket连接之前设置一个Cookie（通过HTTP请求），然后浏览器将会自动发送这个Cookie信息。这适用于处理会话或身份验证信息： \`\`\`javascript // 通过HTTP请求设置cookie document.cookie = \\"sessionToken=your-token; path=/\\"; // 打开WebSocket连接 this.socket = new WebSocket(\`ws://39.99.158.180:9613/web-api/webSocket/print_{randomParam}\`); \`\`\` 请注意，如果WebSocket服务器和当前页面不在相同的域，设置Cookie可能会因跨域限制而失败。 # 安全注意事项 WebSocket连接不应传输敏感信息，除非连接是通过TLS（即 \`wss://\`）加密的。即便如此，敏感信息也不应通过URL查询参数传递，因为URL可能会在服务器端日志文件或其他地方泄露。 在设计WebSocket通信时，建议使用安全最佳实践，例如使用OAuth、JWT等，确保服务端有相应的鉴权和权限控制逻辑。"},{"prompt":"quartz 多租户时用的是主数据库吗","completion":"在一个多租户的Quartz配置中，通常有两种常见的方案： # 1. 多租户共享Quartz数据库 在这种配置中，Quartz使用一个主数据库，该数据库中的所有调度和作业信息都是共享的。这种方案下，多个租户的作业可能在同一个Quartz实例和相同的存储中运行。如果使用这种方式，您通常需要确保作业的key（特别是jobName和groupName组合）是唯一的，通常包含租户的信息。例如： \`\`\`java String jobName = tenantId + \\"_myJob\\"; String groupName = \\"myGroup\\"; JobDetail jobDetail = JobBuilder.newJob(MyJob.class) .withIdentity(jobName, groupName) .build(); \`\`\` 这种方式的好处是能够减少资源消耗和维护成本。但是这也意味着所有租户分享同一份作业调度器的资源，并且数据在逻辑上无法隔离。 # 2. 每个租户独立Quartz数据库 每个租户都有自己的Quartz数据库实例，从而确保租户间的数据隔离性与独立性。在这种配置中，每个Quartz调度器连接到不同的数据库，这些数据库分别持久化每个租户的作业和触发器数据。 为了实现这种策略，需要动态地为不同的租户配置和管理各自的Quartz实例和数据源。这就要求在应用程序启动的时候，在需要的时候动态创建数据源，或者根据租户的请求动态切换数据源。每个数据源都指向不同租户的Quartz数据库。 以下是一个简化的例子，展示了如何用Spring为每个租户配置不同的数据源： \`\`\`java public class MultiTenantSchedulerFactory { public Scheduler getScheduler(String tenantId) throws SchedulerException { // 根据tenantId获取或创建对应的数据源 DataSource dataSource = getDataSourceForTenant(tenantId); // 创建Quartz的SchedulerFactory StdSchedulerFactory factory = new StdSchedulerFactory(); // 设置Scheduler的配置，比如数据源 Properties properties = new Properties(); properties.put(\\"org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName\\", \\"TenantScheduler_\\" + tenantId); properties.put(\\"org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount\\", \\"5\\"); properties.put(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.class\\", \\"org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX\\");

getDataSourceForTenant(String tenantId) { // 根据tenantId创建或获取数据源 // 这可能意味着查询配置存储，或在内存中保存数据源的映射 // ... } } \`\`\` 使用独立数据库的方法提供了最好的数据隔离和安全，但是在管理上更加复杂，并且需要更多的资源来为每个租户维护独立的数据库实例。

配置类。这个类中定义了一个 \`schedulerFactoryBean\` 方法，这个方法创建了一个 \`SchedulerFactoryBean\` 对象并配置 Quartz 属性，尤其是数据库和线程池相关配置。 让我们来看看配置细节： 1. \`factory.setDataSource(dataSource);\` 表明 Quartz 使用了给定的 \`DataSource\` 来连接数据库进行持久化。这意味着，你必须在Spring应用上下文中定义了一个 \`DataSource\` Bean，并且这个数据源用于存储Quartz的调度信息。 2. \`prop.put(...)\` 部分为 Quartz 调度器设置了多种参数。这里设置了调度器的名称、使用的线程池、集群相关设置和数据库表前缀等信息。 3. 通过 \`factory.setQuartzProperties(prop);\` 将这些属性应用到 \`SchedulerFactoryBean\`。 4. \`factory.setSchedulerName(\\"SunScheduler\\");\` 设定了调度器的名称。 5. \`factory.setStartupDelay(1);\` 在 Spring 容器启动后，调度器将被延迟启动1秒。 6. \`factory.setApplicationContextSchedulerContextKey(\\"applicationContextKey\\");\` 允许在 Job 的执行上下文中存取应用上下文。 7. \`factory.setOverwriteExistingJobs(true);\` 这个选项指示应该在启动时更新已存在的 Job 定义。 8. \`factory.setAutoStartup(true);\` 设置自动启动，调度器将在创建后自动启动。 为了支持多租户，并保证隔离每个租户的数据，你需要为每个租户创建一个独立的 \`DataSource\` 并配套一个 \`Scheduler\` 实例。这通常意味着每个租户都有自己的数据库模式（schema）或者数据库实例。 如果希望保持一个共享数据库，你需要在配置上和作业实现上做额外工作来保证数据隔离。这包括在作业的数据，例如数据库表中存取数据时，都需要包含一个用于识别租户的字段或前缀。 在真正的多租户环境中，\`SchedulerFactoryBean\` 的创建和配置可能需要根据当前租户动态地进行，并且资源（如数据库连接和线程）的管理通常也需要更多的考虑，以优化性能和资源利用率。通常，多租户Quartz的配置是在应用程序初始化时或者租户首次使用时动态执行的。"},{"prompt":"请为我写多租户的 quartz","completion":"要实现多租户的 Quartz，你需要能够为每个租户动态地创建和管理自己的调度器实例（\`Scheduler\`），并且每个调度器都应该有其自己的数据源。假设你已经有了一种机制来获取每个租户特定的数据库连接，下面是一个简化的多租户Quartz配置的实现示例： 首先，创建一个\`TenantSchedulerService\`的服务来为每个租户创建调度器： \`\`\`java @Service public class TenantSchedulerService { private final Map<String, Scheduler> tenantSchedulers = new ConcurrentHashMap<>(); public Scheduler getOrCreateScheduler(String tenantId, DataSource tenantDataSource) throws SchedulerException { return tenantSchedulers.computeIfAbsent(tenantId, tid -> createScheduler(tid, tenantDataSource)); } private Scheduler createScheduler(String tenantId, DataSource tenantDataSource) { SchedulerFactoryBean factory = new SchedulerFactoryBean(); factory.setDataSource(tenantDataSource); factory.setSchedulerName(\\"Scheduler_\\" + tenantId); // 以下是Quartz配置的样例 factory.setOverwriteExistingJobs(true); // 配置其他属性，例如线程池等 Properties properties = getQuartzProperties(); factory.setQuartzProperties(properties); try { factory.afterPropertiesSet(); Scheduler scheduler = factory.getObject(); scheduler.start(); return scheduler; } catch (Exception e) { throw new IllegalStateException(\\"Failed to create scheduler for tenant \\" + tenantId, e); } } private Properties getQuartzProperties() { Properties props = new Properties(); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.scheduler.instanceId\\", \\"AUTO\\"); // 线程池配置 props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.threadPool.class\\", \\"org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount\\", \\"5\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.threadPool.threadPriority\\", \\"5\\"); // JobStore配置 props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.class\\", \\"org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.isClustered\\", \\"true\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.clusterCheckinInterval\\", \\"20000\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.useProperties\\", \\"false\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.dataSource\\", \\"myDS\\"); props.setProperty(\\"org.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix\\", \\"QRTZ_\\"); // 其他属性... return props; } } \`\`\` 接着，创建一个\`TenantDataSourceProvider\`来根据tenant ID获取对应的数据源，具体实现依赖于你的数据源管理逻辑。 \`\`\`java @Component public class TenantDataSourceProvider { // 提供获取租户的数据源的实现 public DataSource getTenantDataSource(String tenantId) { // 此处根据tenantId创建并返回对应租户的DataSource实例 // DataSource dataSource = createOrGetDataSourceForTenant(tenantId); // return dataSource; // 示例逻辑，实际中需要根据实际情况来创建或获取租户的DataSource throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"DataSource retrieval not implemented.\\"); } // 实现创建或获取租户DataSource的逻辑... } \`\`\` 现在需要一个机制，例如在用户请求的时候，从\`TenantDataSourceProvider\`中获取数据源，并使用\`TenantSchedulerService\`为该租户实例化一个调度器： \`\`\`java @RestController @RequestMapping(\\"/scheduler\\") public class SchedulerController { @Autowired private TenantSchedulerService tenantSchedulerService; @Autowired private TenantDataSourceProvider tenantDataSourceProvider; @GetMapping(\\"/start/{tenantId}\\") public String startScheduler(@PathVariable String tenantId) { try { DataSource tenantDataSource = tenantDataSourceProvider.getTenantDataSource(tenantId); Scheduler scheduler = tenantSchedulerService.getOrCreateScheduler(tenantId, tenantDataSource); // 之后你可以使用scheduler安排任务等... return \\"Scheduler started for tenant: \\" + tenantId; } catch (SchedulerException e) { e.printStackTrace(); return \\"Failed to start scheduler for tenant: \\" + tenantId; } } // 添加其他端点处理程序来管理调度任务... } \`\`\` 在这个简化的示例中，我们通过在Spring Boot应用程序中的REST控制器上的一个请求来触发对应租户的调度器创建。根据实际场景，你可能需要一种不同的触发机制。 注意： - 这只是一个简化的例子，你的实际实现可能需要考虑错误处理、调度器的生命周期管理（例如，关闭调度器），以及如何高效地处理多个租户的调度器实例。 - 你可能需要对保存Quartz作业的数据库表结构进行租户逻辑分区，或者为每个租户使用单独的数据库架构。 - 当在生产环境中实现多租户Quartz时，请务必实施恰当的数据隔离和安全措施。"},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"公司年会主持稿","completion":"尊敬的各位领导、各位同事，大家好！

양의 식사를 준비할 수 있나 봐. 돼지 뒷다리살을 이용해서 돼지곰탕을 만드는데 자세한 조리 과정을 단계별로 설명하고 있어. 통후추 같은 건 나중에 빼기 귀찮다고 다시 빼나물로 넣으라는 팁 같은 것도 있고, 육수 위에 뜬 기름을 건지는 것처럼 디테일을 신경 쓰라는 조언도 있네. 고기를 얇게 잘라서 국물에 풀어먹거나 고명으로도 쓸 수 있다니, 푸짐하게 먹을 수 있을 것 같아. 나도 저 방법대로 만들어 먹어보고 싶다. 그럼 육수에 간을 맞추는 거랑 다데기를 만들어서 먹는 법에 대해서 좀 더 궁금한 게 있어? 아니면 이거 말고 다른 내용으로 넘어가고 싶어?"},{"prompt":"다데기가 뭐야?","completion":"아, 다데기 말이지? 한식에서 많이 쓰는 양념장 같은 건데, 마늘, 고추가루, 참기름, 새우젓 같은 재료를 다져서 만든 거야. 특히 국이나 찌개 같은 요리에 맛을 더하고, 불 맛을 내는 데 쓰이지. 너도 아마 맛본 적 있을 거야. 한식집 가면 기본적으로 나오는 국물 요리들 맛의 비결 중 하나가 바로 이 다데기 때문이야. 다데기는 조금 진한 맛이 나서 육수나 국에 조금 넣으면 그 맛이 확 퍼지면서 볶음 요리나 구이에도 넣어서 먹으면 진짜 맛있다니까. 그래서 2만원으로 여러 날 먹는 고기 요리라는 영상에서도 다데기를 만들어 간을 맞추는 걸 소개한 거 같아. 너도 이런 팁 활용해서 요리할 때 한 번 써먹어 봐. 진짜 간단하면서도 맛의 차원이 달라질 거야."},{"prompt":"WEBVTT 00:00.000 --> 00:07.960 [오늘의 메뉴] 00:07.960 --> 00:09.260 [오늘의 메뉴]

01:03.320 큼지막한 냄비를 준비했습니다. 01:03.320 --> 01:06.920 뜨겁게 예열한 뒤 기름을 두르고 바로 홍두께를 구워보겠습니다. 01:23.920 --> 01:26.560 이탈리안 비프는 진한 육수가 생명인 요리인데 01:26.560 --> 01:30.000 맛이 진한 것도 중요하지만 육수 색깔이 진한 것이 대단히 중요합니다. 01:30.000 --> 01:33.300 지금 고기 겉면의 색이 그대로 국물색이 되는 거예요. 01:33.300 --> 01:36.200 완전히 짙은 색으로 굽는데 20분 정도 걸렸습니다. 01:36.200 --> 01:39.100 냄비 바닥에 이렇게 갈색 찌꺼기들이 눌어붙어 있는데요. 01:39.100 --> 01:41.400 이게 바로 맛의 원천인 뽕드입니다. 01:41.400 --> 01:44.800 물을 부으면 한 바탕 난리가 나면서 뽕드가 들어올려지거든요. 01:44.800 --> 01:48.100 나무 주걱으로 꼼꼼히 긁어내며 육수 기초 작업을 마쳤습니다. 01:48.100 --> 01:50.100 시카고 스타일 향신료를 넣을 건데요. 01:50.100 --> 01:52.500 오레가노, 코리앤더 시드, 칸넬 시드. 01:52.500 --> 01:55.800 이상 세 가지 낯선 향신료는 도저히 대체할 수가 없었습니다. 01:55.800 --> 01:56.900 그냥 사야 합니다. 01:56.900 --> 01:59.900 후추, 크러쉬드 레드페퍼, 파프리카 파우더. 02:00.000 --> 02:02.400 매운맛 3종은 역시 대체할 수가 없는데 02:02.400 --> 02:04.320 많이 쓰는 거라 사는 게 아깝진 않아요. 02:04.320 --> 02:06.720 그리고 갈릭 파우더, 어니언 파우더, 02:06.720 --> 02:09.240 실제 마늘과 양파를 한 주먹 넣어도 괜찮습니다. 02:09.240 --> 02:11.600 이렇게 모아서 담아넣으니까 엄청 예쁘네요. 02:11.600 --> 02:14.040 8가지 향신료를 그대로 육수에 투하합니다. 02:14.040 --> 02:17.200 2단계에서 이미 시카고에 있는 듯한 향이 퍼지더라고요. 02:17.200 --> 02:20.280 아까 잘 구워둔 홍두께를 국물 속에 배치할 건데요. 02:20.280 --> 02:24.640 지름 28cm 냄비에 약 2.7kg 6조각이 꼭 맞게 들어가더라고요. 02:24.640 --> 02:26.000 이제 물을 채우는데 02:26.000 --> 02:29.080 이렇게 수면 위로 고기가 살짝 튀어나오는 게 포인트입니다. 02:29.080 --> 02:29.960 저는 1L 정도는... 02:30.000 --> 02:31.680 이 높이가 맞춰졌어요. 02:31.680 --> 02:33.320 이것은 비프 스톡 큐브입니다. 02:33.320 --> 02:36.480 치킨 스톡과 달리 비프 스톡은 제품 종류가 거의 없어요. 02:36.480 --> 02:39.280 네이버에서 2,000원대로 스페인 수입품을 사봤습니다. 02:39.280 --> 02:42.280 뒷면에 보시면 1L에 큐브 2개를 넣으라고 쓰여있죠. 02:42.280 --> 02:45.200 제가 방금 1L 물을 채웠으니까 큐브 2개를 넣으면 02:45.200 --> 02:47.600 비프 스톡을 만들어 넣은 듯한 효과가 되겠죠. 02:47.600 --> 02:49.880 뚜껑을 덮지 않은 채로 오븐으로 옮겨서 02:49.880 --> 02:52.560 예열된 170도로 1시간 조리하겠습니다. 02:54.600 --> 02:58.200 지난 영상 보시면 샐러리와 고추로 만든 채소 토핑이 있었는데요. 02:58.200 --> 02:59.960 그게 자르디니에라라고 하는... 03:00.000 --> 03:04.240 이탈리안 비프 샌드위치에는 반드시 들어가는 필수 요소죠. 03:04.240 --> 03:08.280 저는 샐러리, 당조고추, 컬러미니 파프리카 3가지 채소를 샀고요. 03:08.280 --> 03:10.680 맵지 않다면 고추 종류는 아무거나 괜찮습니다. 03:10.680 --> 03:12.920 자르디니에라 조각의 크기는 자기 맘입니다. 03:12.920 --> 03:15.760 완전히 다져버리기도 하고 깍두기처럼 크게 썰기도 해요. 03:15.760 --> 03:17.680 저는 조금 큼지막하게 썰어봤습니다. 03:17.680 --> 03:20.200 채소를 미리 유리 용기에 담아서 계량할 거예요. 03:20.200 --> 03:22.560 이렇게 락앤락과 유리병이 하나씩 나왔는데요. 03:22.560 --> 03:26.320 미리 생수를 채워서 물이 얼마나 필요한지 가늠을 하는 겁니다. 03:26.320 --> 03:28.000 저는 1L 정도 필요하더라고요. 03:28.000 --> 03:30.000 새 냄비를 꺼내서 소금 1, 설탕 1 03:30.000 --> 03:33.600 생수 10, 식초 20, 비율에 맞춰 계량해 넣습니다. 03:33.600 --> 03:36.520 식초는 이렇게 투명한 화이트 비네거를 추천해드리고요. 03:36.520 --> 03:38.760 피클 장아찌는 오래 저장하는 요리니까 03:38.760 --> 03:41.600 완전 살균을 한다는 의미로 제대로 팔팔 끓여야 합니다. 03:41.600 --> 03:45.040 이제 채소가 담긴 유리 용기에 뜨거운 용액을 채워 넣으면 되는데요. 03:45.040 --> 03:48.120 이탈리안이라더니 특별한 게 하나도 없네? 라고 생각이 드시죠. 03:48.120 --> 03:50.840 자르디니에라만의 특징은 잠시 후에 보여드릴게요. 03:52.840 --> 03:54.600 오븐 조리 1시간이 지났습니다. 03:54.600 --> 03:57.680 국물이 꽤 졸았고 고기 윗면이 아주 진하게 구워져 있죠. 03:57.680 --> 03:59.720 오븐 없이 약불로 끓여도 되긴 하는데 03:59.720 --> 04:00.000 오븐 없이 약불로 끓여도 되긴 한데 04:00.000 --> 04:02.000 고기만 건져서 따로 담아놨고요. 04:02.000 --> 04:05.000 육수와 고기 둘 다 완전히 차갑게 식히겠습니다. 04:07.000 --> 04:10.000 다음 날 냄비를 열어보니까 이렇게 기름 조각이 떠올랐습니다. 04:10.000 --> 04:13.000 마블링 하나도 없는 홍두깨였는데도 약간은 있었나봐요. 04:13.000 --> 04:16.000 이 기름과 향신료 조각들을 전부 체에 걸러냅니다. 04:16.000 --> 04:19.000 결과물은 육수가 아니라 거의 진액에 가까운 모습이죠. 04:19.000 --> 04:21.000 그래서 생수를 섞어서 국물을 늘릴 거예요. 04:21.000 --> 04:23.000 국물의 양은 처음 고기와 1대1. 04:23.000 --> 04:28.000 제가 홍두깨 2.7kg를 구웠으니까 2.7L 국물이 충분히 진하게 나오는 거예요. 04:28.000 --> 04:30.000 2.7L 국물이 충분히 진하게 나오는 거예요. 04:30.000 --> 04:33.300 이렇게 비프 스톡 큐브도 2개 추가해서 총 4개를 넣었고요. 04:33.300 --> 04:36.400 마지막으로 간을 보고 싱거우면 소금, 짜면 물을 추가하세요. 04:36.400 --> 04:38.800 이렇게 이탈리안 비프 육수가 완성되었습니다. 04:38.800 --> 04:40.500 여러분, 이게 무엇인지 아십니까? 04:40.500 --> 04:42.800 코스트코에서

11:40.200 --> 11:43.280 굳이 육절기 없이도 충분히 만들 수 있는 요리라고 생각합니다 11:43.280 --> 11:46.280 아 그리고 다시 한 번 이 국물에 대해서는 참 11:46.280 --> 11:48.840 얼마나 이 맛의 정수가 담겨 있는지 11:48.840 --> 11:52.720 이 국물 때문에 비주얼과 달리 콜라도 맥주도 어울리지 않구요 11:52.720 --> 11:53.920 와인이 먼저 떠올라요 11:53.920 --> 11:55.760 그 정도로 초특급 국물입니다 11:55.760 --> 11:58.240 우리 인식 안에 있는 고기 샌드위치가 아니라 11:58.240 --> 12:00.000 요리 샌드위치 같은 고품격의 12:00.000 --> 12:03.360

보여요 아니 그냥 엄청 많아요 방치형 RPG 스토리가 탄탄해서 많이들 하는 건가 하고 보면 아무것도 없고 이런 걸 왜 하는 걸까요? 일반적으로 나오는 설명은 이거죠 1990년대 후반에서 2000년대 초중반에 유행했던 다마고치의 재미를 구현했다 기계 속에 있는 애완동물 밥 주고 똥 치워주고 성장시키는 게 전부인 게임들 그 재미라면 이해됩니다 그땐 즐길 게 부족했던 시기라 진짜 재밌었죠 근데 지금은 아닌데? 그렇기에 살펴봐야 할 건 다마고치가 아니라 방치왕 RPG의 역사가 아닌가 싶더라고요 방치왕 RPG는 정말 오래된 장르입니다 2002년 무한 반복 노가도록 무장한 온라인 RPG들이 지배하던 시기 서구권에서 나왔던 한 텍스트 게임이 있었습니다 캐릭터 설정만 입력하면 모든 플레이를 자동으로 알아서 해주는 게임 \\"이 게임은 최근에 대성공을 거둔\\" \\"온라인 게임들의 트렌드를 따라가고 있지만\\" \\"특유의 지루함은 탈피했습니다\\" \\"날값 빠진 다른 RPG들의\\" \\"지루한 캐릭터 관리는 집어치우고 말이죠\\" 즉, 의미 없는 노가다를 요구하는 게임들 비꾸려고 나온 패러디 게임이었어요 진지하게 방치 플레이가 재밌다고 생각해서 만들어진 게임이 안 했다는 거죠 하지만 여기 그래서 재미를 느끼는 서구권 유저들이 있었습니다 내가 만들고 내가 소유한 캐릭터가 커가는 데서 뿌듯함을 느끼는 분들이 있었습니다 어... 좀 더 보죠 한편 이 시기엔 플래시 게임이란 것도 있었어요 한국에서도 2006년 초부터 엄청난 인기를 누린 게임 그리고 당시 유행했던 플래시 게임 중에 무한으로 돈 벌기 죽도록 랩업하기 같은 게 있었습니다 예를 들면 광맥을 마우스로 광클해 돈을 모으고 그걸로 곡갱이를 업그레이드 그렇게 돈 더 잘 버는 곡갱이로 돈을 모아 조건을 충족시킨 뒤 다음 장소로 이동 이런 패턴을 무한히 반복하는 별거 없는 노가다 게임이었죠 하지만 여기에 열광하며 친구보다 높은 점수를 내려는 경쟁까지 존재했어요 내 시간과 노력을 투자해 이룩한 결과에 뿌듯함을 느끼는 분들이 많았어요 현재의 방치형 게임과 비슷한 구조입니다 다만 방치형 게임은 아니에요 클릭커라고 부르는 장르죠 PC와 콘솔 기기만 있던 시절이니까 방치형 게임이 나온다고 흥할 상황도 아니었고 그런데 스마트폰이 보급되기 시작하면서 트렌드가 변하기 시작해요 조작이 불편한 스마트폰의 특성상 적은 조작으로 즐길 수 있는 게임이 각광받기 시작했거든요 2012년 말 달걀을 100만 번 터치하는 게임이 유행한 적이 있었거든요 무의미한 반복로가 다죠 PC 게임이었으면 안 했겠죠 그러나 스마트폰 게임이었고요 다른 게임엔 뭐가 나올까에 대한 기대감이 100만 번의 터치를 놀이로 바꿔준 결과 현재 기준으로 500만 다운로드를 넘긴 게임이 됐어요 다만 이후에 비슷한 게임들이 많이 나왔지만 크게 주목받지는 못했습니다 단순한 목적을 위해 계속 터치를 반복하는 건 쉽게 질릴 수밖에 없는 행위기도 하구요 직접 터치하는 게 너무 힘드니까 자동 터치 프로그램을 돌리는 분들이 많았거든 이러면 손으로 직접 터치를 한다는 걸 염두에 두고 게임을 설계한 의미가 없어지죠 그렇기에 점점 자동 시스템의 필요성이 늘어나던 상황에서 2014년 12월 캐나다의 한 개발사가 2개월 만에 만든 RPG로 세상을 놀라게 했죠 무한 터치로 칼을 휘둘러서 몬스터를 잡고 그렇게 모은 재화로 공격력을 올리는 RPG 효율이 좋진 않았지만 자동 전투를 제공하는 RPG 자동 사냥을 권장할 생각이 없으니 이렇게만 만든 거죠 근데 자동 사냥을 조금이라도 제공한다는 점은요 터치로 검을 반복적으로 휘두르는 노가다 자체는 가장 재미있는 요소까진 아니란 점을 보여줘요 가장 재미있는 요소라면 스킵할 수 있게 만들어둘 이유가 없거든요 즉, 핵심 재미 요소는요 유저가 터치를 통해 검을 휘두르고 그 결과 내 캐릭터가 성장하는 과정이 반복되면서요 터치라는 행위가 성장으로 이어진다는 걸 학습하고 터치라는 행위에 재미를 느끼게 된다라는 부분인 겁니다 그리고 이 개념을 중심으로 방치형 RPG가 발전해 자체는 자동의 영역으로 넘겼습니다 그 대신 무인 제외를 어디에 쓸까 고민하고 투자하는 버튼만 직접 터치하게 만들고 있죠 터치 할 걸 정말 많이 만들어두죠 즉, 현재의 방치형 게임은요 자동 사냥이 재밌어서 하는 장르가 아닙니다 터치라는 행위를 통해 성장이라는 결과를 내는 게 재밌으니까 하는 장르에요 방치형 게임에 빠지지 않는 PVP나 랭킹 요소도요 터치라는 행위가 더욱 보람찬 결과로 이어지게 만들기 위한 요소인 거구요 뭔 말인진 알겠는데 솔직히 PC나 콘솔 게임보다 재미없잖아 심지어 자동사냥 있는 모바일 MMORPG보다 콘텐츠가 없잖아 방치형 게임을 할 이유가 있나? 그렇죠 다만 게임을 한다는 건 현실 세계에 투자할 시간을 다른 세상에 투자한다는 뜻인데요 현실에서 할 일이 많을수록 그게 쉽지 않습니다 공부하는 학생이나 부모님 눈치가 보여서 잠깐 쉬고 내일 또 출근해야 해서 집안일이 계속 밀려서 등의 현실적인 이유로요 그래서 PC나 콘솔 게임처럼 온전한 몰입을 요구하는 게임을 하지 못하는 분도 많은 겁니다 자동사냥을 지원한 저는 모바일 MMORPG도 좋죠 근데 너무 바빠서 하루 이틀 못 돌리면 성장이 멈추잖아요 손해 봤다는 느낌이 듭니다 근데 방치형 게임은 며칠 접속 못 해도 성장은 꾸준히 하고요 엄청난 집중력을 요구하지도 않죠 드라마 보면서도 할 수 있고 공부나 일을 하면서도 할 수 있어요 그렇게 여유가 없으면 그냥 게임을 안 하면 되는 거 아니야? 굳이 해야 해? 그렇긴 하죠 그렇기에 방치형 게임이 주류가 되지는 못한 거고요 2023년 센서타워 기준 한국 모바일 RPG 시장에서 방치형 게임의 매출 비중은 3%뿐 2020년에 비하면 많이 성장했지만 규모가 크진 않다는 겁니다 하지만 모바일 게임 시장이 게임사들에게 매력적인 이유가 뭐죠? 원래는 게임을 하지 않았던 분들조차 조금씩 게임을 즐기는 플랫폼이기 때문이잖아요 솔직히 방치형 게임 PC나 콘솔 게임을 기준으로 평가하면 그냥 망겜이죠 하지만 게임을 잘하지 않던 분들의 기준에서 평가하면 엄청나게 집중하지 않아도 즐길 수 있는 게임을 원하는 분들의 기준에서 평가하면 그리고 게임사 입장에서도 방치형은 매력적이에요 게임은 굉장히 단순하고 엄청난 그래픽과 콘텐츠가 요구되는 장르도 아니니까 개발비와 인력을 적게 투입해도 괜찮은 결과물이 나오거든요 게다가 메인 과금 모델은 추가 보상을 제공하는 대가로 유저들이 광고를 보게 하는 것 그리고 광고 보기 싫은 유저들 대상으로 광고 제거 패키지를 파는 건데요 엄청난 수익이 나오는 건 아니지만 나름 쏠쏠한 수익을 냅니다 기존 게임 시장의 고객들보다 더 넓은 고객층을 공략하는 장르니까 여기에 덧바른 성장을 원하는 과금러들을 위한 패키지나 가채를 팔면 좀 더 많이 벌죠 그렇기에 이러면서 대형 게임사들까지 뛰어들어서 방치형 게임을 만들고 있는데요 가끔 방치형 RPG를 무한 자동사냥을 제공하는 MMORPG처럼 만드는 경우가 있습니다 2022년 12월에 출시된 사머넌터 키우기도 그런 케이스였죠 기본적으로 방치형 게임은 터치를 통해 성장하는 재미를 느끼는 장르잖아요 그렇기에 유저들이 뭔가를 계속 터치할 수 있게 말이죠 성장 구간을 세세하게 나눕니다 터치를 할 때마다 공격력이 10에서 100으로 100에서 1000으로 늘어나면서 최종적으로는 1주에 도달하는 시기죠 물론 터치를 할 때마다 실제 오르는 성장 폭 자체는 크지 않습니다 하지만 숫자 자체는 팍팍 늘다 보니 일종의 착시 현상을 겪죠 \\"오늘 내 캐릭터\\" \\"엄청 많이 성장한 것 같은데?\\" 그렇게 방청 게임이 과금 상품을 정말 많이 파는 편인데도 과금, 유도 자체는 비교적 적다고 평가받기도 하는 겁니다 과금을 안 해도 성장한다는 감각을 계속 주니까 지금 서머너터 키우기 이름 옆에 붙어있는 38,000 뽑기 증정이란 문제라... 성장에서도 느껴지죠? 어떤 식으로 숫자를 다루고 있는지 그런데 서머너터 키우기는 원래 이런 성장 감각을 제대로 제공하지 못하는 게임이었어요 기본적인 틀은 능력치 키우고 장비 얻고 캐릭터 뽑아서 악마댁, 감전댁 등을 짜는 형태인데요 아무리 RPG여도 크게 신경 안 쓰고 즐기는 게 방치형 장르잖아요 그런데 귀찮은 주작을 요구하는 숙제 미션들이 많았어 방치형 게임인데 방치하면 재화가 별로 안 모여 게임을 꺼두면 재화가 더 안 모여 성장하는 티가 안 나 그러면 어떻게 된다? 과금 상품... 이 성장에 대한 불만이 억제가 안된다 물론 이를 포함해 여러 문제들을 조금씩 고치긴 했는데 방치형 게임은 초반이 중요하거든요 신작 경쟁이 엄청 치열하니까 근데 출시 초반에 망했죠 그러니 깔끔하게 포기하면 편합니다 개발비도 적게 드는 장르니까 신작 만들면 됩니다 실제로 서비스 종료시켰죠 다만, 엄밀히 말하면 서비스 종료는 아니었어요 기존에는 스프릿 세이버라는 이름이었는데 서먼 헌터 키우기로 바꿨고요 기존 유저들에게 신규 버전에서 쓸 수 있는 재화 보상해주고 전부 개정 종료 과금러에겐 과금액 상당의 게시제와 보너스 보상을 지급했고요 UI, 편의성 시스템, 스펙업 구조도 갈아 엎었죠 즉, 죽어버린 게임을 살리겠다는 어려운 길을 선택한 겁니다 템포 빠른 전투와 귀엽고 아기자기한 도트 때문에 보는 맛은 있다고 평가받았으니까 보기하고 싶지 않아서 그랬던 것 같고요 그리고 결과물은 방치형 게임에 본질에 집중한 형태 일단 피로감을 대폭 낮췄죠 하루 한두 번만 접속해도 보상을 챙길 수 있게요 600개였던 스테이지도 3천개로 늘었습니다 비교를 하자면 스펙을 똑같이 올려두요 이전엔 1개 스테이지를 깼다면 이제는 5개 깨는 겁니다 더 있어 보이죠? 그리고 다양한 신규 스텟이 추가되고 장비도 세분화 됐는데요 일반적인 RPG라면 과금 유도가 늘어난 겁니다 근데 이건 방치형 게임이니까요 스펙 업스턴을 세분화함으로써 유저가 성장을 많이 하고 있다고 느끼게 유도, 현질에 대한 간절함을 낮춘 거죠 물론 작정하고 랭킹 노리면 과금할 요소가 많아진 건 맞지만 \\"어, 굳이... 랭킹을?\\" 그리고 어려움을 극복하는 과정에서 살아나기 위해 쿠폰 보상 등을 자주 뿌렸었는데요 그 기조가 지금도 이어져서 공식 카페 쿠폰을 통해 캐시제와 33만 개를 뿌리는 등 뭘 많이 뿌립니다 소규모 팀이 운영하기에 할 수 있는 일이 한계가 있긴 해도 거니사항에 대한 피드백도 자주 해주고 덕분에 서머너 더 키우기는 업데이트 전보다 나은 실적을 내게 되죠 자 어쨌든 지금까지 방청 RPG에 대해 살펴봤는데요 모두를 위한 장르는 아니긴 합니다 단순한 구조가 핵심인 만큼 차별화도 어렵고 경쟁도 치열하죠 다만 바쁜 일상 속에서도 게임을 즐기길 원하는 분들이 계속 찾는 장르니까요 앞으로 계속 발전하는 장르가 될 수 있을지가 중요한 포인트 아닐까 싶네요 지금까지 펭귄몬스터였습니다 그럼 펭빠잉~ 보셔도 나쁘지 않을 것 같습니다 이건 유튜브 \\"방치형 게임이 인기 많은 이유\\"라는 제목의 대사 스크립트인데 어떻게 생각해 일단 이 내용부터 설명해주고 느낀점을 알려줘","completion":"이 유튜브 스크립트는 방치형 게임, 특히 RPG 장르의 그것이 인기 있는 이유를 다루는 것 같아. 처음엔 방치형 게임이 왜 사람들이 좋아하는지 의문을 제기하면서, 이전의 다마고치와 같은 간단한 노가다 게임의 재미를 현대적으로 재현한 것이 방치형 게임의 인기에 한 원인이 될 수 있다고 얘기하고 있어. 이런 게임들이 처음 등장했을 때는 패러디 게임이나 간단한 플래시 게임으로 시작되었는데, 사람들이 자신이 만든 캐릭터가 성장하는 걸 지켜보며 뿌듯함을 느끼는 경험을 중시했던 것 같아. 이후 스마트폰의 보급으로 게임의 트렌드가 변하면서, 손쉽게 접근 가능하고 적은 조작으로 즐길 수 있는 방치형 게임이 주목받게 됐지. 방치형 RPG가 인기를 끌고 있는 주된 이유 중 하나는 바쁜 일상에서 게임에 몰입할 시간이 부족한 현대인들이 여전히 게임의 성장과 성취감을 즐길 수 있는 방식이기 때문이야. 이런 게임들은 복잡하고 시간이 많이 드는 게임에 비해 단순하고 빠르게 성장의 느낌을 줘서, 부담 없이 즐길 수 있고 매일 접속할 필요도 없이 장기간에 걸쳐 조금씩 성장하는 캐릭터를 지켜보는 걸로 만족할 수 있다는 거지. 개인적으로 이런 스타일의 게임들이 대중적으로 인기를 끌 수 있는 배경은 그만큼 사람들이 바쁜 생활에 치이면서 뭔가를 여유롭게 즐길 수 있는 여가 시간이 부족하기 때문에 생긴 문화적 반영일 수도 있겠다 싶어. 생각해보면, 이 게임들은 현대 생활 패턴에 맞춘 새로운 게임의 모습을 나타내고 있는데, 그게 성공하기 위해서는 사용자 경험(UX)이 중요하겠지? 너무 방치해서 게임의 본질을 잃어버리면 유저들이 떠날 테고, 반대로 유저가 원하는 만큼의 성장과 성취감을 잘 제공하면 긴 시간을 즐길 수 있는 게임으로 자리 잡을 수도 있겠다 싶어. 너는 이 주제에 대해 어떤 생각이야? 방치형 게임에 대한 관심이나 어떤 점이 이채롭게 느껴지는지 말이지."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image

profil : spécialité NSI ma contreverse AI dans le domaine de l'art je dois répondre a cette question.Etape 1: Comment et pourquoi avez-vous choisi cette thématique ? Expliquer par exemple, si c'est un choix lié à votre orientation, à un sujet qui vous intéresse par ailleurs à une thématique que vous appréciez en spécialité Expliquer également si et pourquoi vous avez hésité et/ou changé de thématique","completion":"Je ne suis pas capable de vous fournir des détails sur vos choix personnels ou vos raisons puisque je suis une intelligence artificielle et non un être humain avec des expériences ou des préférences personnelles. Cependant, je peux vous fournir un cadre de réponse qui pourrait correspondre à un élève de spécialité NSI (Numérique et Sciences Informatiques) ayant choisi la thématique de l'intelligence artificielle dans le domaine de l'art. --- L'intérêt pour la convergence de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) et de l'art a émergé naturellement de ma passion pour la technologie et mon appréciation pour l'expression créative. En tant qu'étudiant spécialisé en NSI, je suis continuellement fasciné par les progrès technologiques et leur impact sur la société. L'IA, en particulier, présente des avancées remarquables qui redéfinissent les limites de ce qui est possible. D'un autre côté, l'art a toujours eu une place privilégiée dans ma vie, que ce soit à travers l'appréciation de différents courants artistiques ou la pratique personnelle de disciplines créatives. La capacité de l'art à évoquer des émotions et à provoquer la réflexion est, à mes yeux, une manifestation puissante de l'esprit humain. En combinant l'IA et l'art, j'ai choisi une thématique qui non seulement capitalise sur mes intérêts académiques et personnels mais aussi explore une question controversée au cœur des débats contemporains : la capacité de l'intelligence artificielle à être créative et à produire des œuvres ayant une valeur artistique. La décision n'a pas été sans hésitation. Initialement, j'ai envisagé d'autres domaines d'application de l'IA comme la santé ou l'environnement. Cependant, l'art IA soulève des interrogations uniques sur la nature de la créativité et sur le rôle que les machines peuvent jouer en tant qu'agents créatifs. Cette interrogation fondamentale sur la collaboration entre l'humain et la machine dans un processus aussi subjectif et intime que la création artistique me semblait d'une richesse particulière, tant pour le défi intellectuel que pour le potentiel d'innovation. En fin de compte, il était clair que choisir cette thématique me permettrait non seulement d'explorer un domaine d'actualité mais aussi d'apporter ma propre perspective au croisement de deux de mes plus grandes passions."},{"prompt":"Et t'il une contreverse cette problématique faut il réguler l'art fait par intelligence artificielle intelligence artificielle","completion":"La problématique de l'art créé par l'intelligence artificielle (IA) est effectivement source de controverse dans plusieurs milieux, artistiques et légaux notamment. Plusieurs questions émergent à ce sujet : 1. **Authenticité et Créativité**: Peut-on considérer une œuvre générée par une IA comme étant authentiquement \\"créative\\"? Le débat s'intéresse à la nature de la créativité et si elle peut être attribuée à des algorithmes qui analysent et synthétisent des données sans conscience ni expérience subjective. 2. **Droits d'Auteur**: Qui détient les droits d'auteur d'une œuvre créée par une IA? Est-ce le programmeur de l'IA, l'utilisateur qui a fourni les consignes initiales, ou l'IA elle-même (bien que cela pose des questions juridiques puisqu'une IA n'a pas de personnalité juridique)? 3. **Impact sur les Artistes**: L’utilisation croissante des IA pour la création d'œuvres peut-elle dévaloriser le travail des artistes humains? Certains s'inquiètent que le succès commercial potentiel des œuvres créées par IA puisse éclipser l'art traditionnel ou réduire les opportunités pour les artistes vivants. 4. **Question Éthique**: Les œuvres créées par IA posent aussi des questions éthiques, surtout si l'IA est conçue pour imiter le style d'artistes spécifiques, possiblement sans leur consentement. Cela soulève des questions de propriété intellectuelle et de respect de l'héritage artistique. 5. **Impact Culturel et Social**: L'art informe et influence la culture. Si les IA jouent un rôle majeur dans la création artistique, comment cela façonnera-t-il notre culture? Qui choisit les paramètres de ce que l'IA crée et quelles sont les implications de ces choix? 6. **Qualité et Originalité**: La qualité des œuvres d'art générées par IA est également un sujet de controverse. Bien que les IA puissent créer des œuvres complexes, certains remettent en question leur originalité et profondeur émotionnelle comparativement à celles créées par des humains. Devant ces interrogations multiples et complexes, la possibilité et la nécessité de réguler l'art créé par IA sont vigoureusement débattues. Il s'agit de savoir comment encadrer cette pratique pour garantir le respect de la propriété intellectuelle, maintenir l'équité du marché de l'art, et préserver l'intégrité culturelle et humaine de la création artistique. Pour réguler cette nouvelle forme d'art, il faudrait non seulement définir des lois adaptées mais également établir des normes éthiques partagées. Ces régulations sont essentielles pour maintenir un équilibre entre l'innovation technologique et la protection des droits et valeurs humains essentiels dans le domaine de l'art."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

At first glance, \\"IDK what\\" might appear to be a dismissive response, a simple shorthand used by someone not willing to explore the depths of their ignorance or to admit the limits of their knowledge. On the contrary, \\"IDK what\\" can be seen as an expression of openness, the starting point of inquiry, and an honest acknowledgment that there is more to learn. # The Comfort in Uncertainty There's a certain comfort in admitting \\"IDK what.\\" Acknowledging what we don't know frees us from the pressure of having to be experts on everything. It invites others to share their knowledge and offers an opportunity for collective exploration. This phrase encourages humility and curiosity, reminding us that life is a perpetual learning process. # The Cultural Phenomenon With the rise of internet language and texting, the abbreviation \\"IDK\\" has become deeply embedded in our cultural communication practices. It's often used in a playful way, but it can also serve as a genuine response to complex questions, especially when the answer isn't readily available or when the question touches upon the edges of our understanding. # The Personal and the Universal On a personal level, \\"IDK what\\" can relate to our careers, relationships, or our search for meaning. How many times have we found ourselves at a crossroads, unsure of which path to take, mumbling to ourselves, \\"I don't know what to do\\"? This phrase captures both the vulnerability and the potential within such moments of uncertainty. On a broader scale, \\"IDK what\\" applies to the uncharted territories of science and philosophy—dark matter, the nature of consciousness, or the question of extraterrestrial life. It's a reminder that no matter how much we discover, the universe always has more enigmas to offer. # The Gateway to Discovery When we embrace \\"IDK what,\\" we stand at the threshold of discovery. It's the phrase that prefaces the experiments of scientists, the studies of researchers, and the brainstorming of innovators. It's the recognition that, despite past successes in mapping the known world, there are still oceans of the unknown to explore. # The Shift in Perspective Instead of viewing \\"IDK what\\" as a limitation, we can choose to see it as an invitation—an invitation to question, to seek, and to imagine. It's a prompt that fuels our creativity and sparks our intellectual passions. The void left by the \\"what\\" which we do not know is the space where new ideas, new theories, and new possibilities grow. In conclusion, \\"IDK what\\" is far more than a casual abbreviation. It's a reflection of the ceaseless journey of learning and the exhilarating potential that lies in every unknown. Whether used in everyday conversations or as a humble admission of our ever-present limits, \\"IDK what\\" is a small phrase that opens the door to the vastness of the unexplored and the potential of the future."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Se hai domande specifiche o bisogno di assistenza su un argomento, sono qui per aiutarti!"},{"prompt":"In quali linguaggi di programmazione riesci a fornirmi il migliore codice con meno errori e più completo?","completion":"Come modello di intelligenza artificiale, posso generare codice in vari linguaggi di programmazione. Tuttavia, la mia abilità nel farlo varia a seconda della popolarità e della documentazione disponibile per ciascun linguaggio, nonché dalla frequenza con cui viene richiesto e utilizzato. In generale, posso fornire codice più affidabile ed essere più efficace in linguaggi di programmazione ampiamente utilizzati e ben documentati. Ecco alcuni linguaggi per i quali posso generalmente fornire codice di alta qualità: 1. Python: È uno dei linguaggi più popolari e viene ampiamente utilizzato per la sua semplicità e leggibilità. È inoltre molto usato in applicazioni open source, machine learning e script di automazione. 2. JavaScript: È il linguaggio principale per lo sviluppo web lato client e dispongo di una vasta gamma di conoscenze sulle sue API e sui framework associati come React, Angular e Vue.js. 3. Java: È un linguaggio comune per lo sviluppo di applicazioni aziendali, mobile (soprattutto Android) e sistemi backend. 4. C#: Utilizzato soprattutto nell'ambito dello sviluppo di applicazioni Windows e giochi con Unity, è un altro linguaggio che posso gestire abbastanza bene. 5. PHP: È ancora ampiamente utilizzato per lo sviluppo web, e posso fornire codice per script e applicazioni web backend. 6. TypeScript: Una sorta di \\"JavaScript con tipi\\", TypeScript è diventato molto popolare per lo sviluppo di applicazioni web su larga scala. 7. Ruby: Conosciuto soprattutto per il framework Ruby on Rails per lo sviluppo web, è un linguaggio che posso utilizzare abilmente. 8. Go (Golang): È un linguaggio moderno che sta guadagnando popolarità in sistemi e applicazioni ad alte prestazioni. 9. C++: Per quanto riguarda lo sviluppo di software di sistema e applicazioni che richiedono alte prestazioni, C++ è ancora molto utilizzato e qualcosa che posso gestire. 10. SQL: Per la gestione dei database, posso aiutare a scrivere query SQL complesse e ottimizzate. Tuttavia, la mia capacità di fornire codice corretto dipende non solo dal linguaggio ma anche dalla specificità e dalla comprensibilità della tua richiesta. Per esempio, potresti ottenere risultati migliori se fornisci dettagli chiari e controlli il codice suggerito prima di utilizzarlo in un ambiente di produzione. Inoltre, i linguaggi di nicchia o quelli che aderiscono a standard molto rigorosi, come ADA o Rust, potrebbero avere una precisione variabile a seconda della complessità del problema."},{"prompt":"Puoi accedere ad internet? Quanti token si possono utilizzare per farti una domanda? A quante parole corrispondono?","completion":"No, come modello di intelligenza artificiale sviluppato da OpenAI, non ho accesso diretto a Internet. Le mie risposte si basano su una vasta gamma di informazioni che sono state incluse nel mio training fino al momento della mia ultima formazione, che comprende dati raccolti fino a un certo punto nel tempo che precede la mia data di \\"taglio della conoscenza\\". Quindi, non sono in grado di accedere o recuperare informazioni in tempo reale da Internet o da qualsiasi database esterno. In termini di input, l'uso di token è un modo per misurare la quantità di testo che posso generare o elaborare in una volta. Un token può essere una parola, una parte di una parola (ad esempio, le sillabe o i pezzi di parole create dividendo parole più lunghe), o anche un segno di punteggiatura. In media, un token equivale a circa quattro caratteri di testo in lingua inglese. Per quanto riguarda il modello GPT-3, la lunghezza massima di input (incluso prompt e completamento) è di 4096 token. Nel caso di GPT-4, i dettagli precisi possono variare, ma di solito i modelli sono progettati per gestire un numero simile o leggermente maggiore di token rispetto alle versioni precedenti. Il numero di parole che corrispondono a questi token può variare, poiché non tutte le parole sono della stessa lunghezza, ma in media potresti aspettarti che 1000 token rappresentino all'incirca 750-800 parole in inglese.

None of the dialogues and descriptions of events in the screenplay/shooting script should be truncated. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house; the source of the returning woman's urge shouldn't be induced by illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance nor spicy food), for a very long comedic scene in a Comedy Drama TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A Mexican American female youth (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s a sophomore; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief and muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern as the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman ponders out loud about the odor again. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if the odor is coming from the returning woman. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. The present woman proceeds to sniff nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman rhetorically asks if the odor is a result of the returning woman pooping in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants and for how dirty pooping in her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so childish like pooping in her pants is inconceivable. The present woman proceeds to disappointedly ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and finished the whole bowel movement in her pants. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and push the poop into her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to release her bowels and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. The returning woman adds that she had to do this even if it meant that she would get everything out into her pants. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where she had to make the decision to push out a whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitance by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously taunt the returning woman for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop not because of special intention on her part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. This is all happening as the present woman is inspecting the bulge in returning woman's pants. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is inconceivably nasty and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. The present woman continues by tauntingly admonishing the returning woman for pooping in her pants with what looked like the contentment of a child, and goes on by saying that the returning woman probably enjoys the odor emanating from her pants just like she enjoys having her pants be so full. Then, as she is still inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she remarks in resignation that based on the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by tauntingly scolding the returning woman for how terribly smelly the returning woman is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In response, the present woman reinforces her own physical actions that are intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman's pants, while continuing to complain. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about her grown daughter - the returning woman - childishly making the present woman have to put up with the returning woman’s smelly, soiled pants.","completion":"**INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY** We open on a bustling urban apartment complex. The walls are adorned with festive decorations, hinting at a close-knit community. Amidst the sounds of playing children and chatting neighbors, a young woman, *SOFIA*, early 20s, Mexican American, with a short, sporty haircut and wearing brightly colored athletic shorts and a college sweatshirt, dashes toward her family's apartment door. Sofia's face is distressed, gritting her teeth; she is clearly in a hurry and discomfort. She had attended a marathon study session at the library which went on without breaks. And now, the long walk home without a pit stop has resulted in a rather urgent situation. **EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** Sofia's steps quicken as she reaches her door, rummaging through her backpack with one hand while the other instinctively presses on her abdomen. **SOFIA** (*muttering to herself*) Oh, come on, where is it... Sofia fumbles for her keys but cannot find them. Panic-stricken and now on the verge of crisis, she starts knocking on the door—first gently, then frantically. Cut to a CLOSE-UP of Sofia's anxious face, beads of sweat forming on her forehead, then back to her hammering on the door. **INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS** Sofia's mother, *MARGARITA*, late 40s, with kind eyes and hair tied in a neat bun, appears from the kitchen, wiping her hands on an apron. She's surprised by the urgency of the knocks. **MARGARITA** (*calls out*) ¿Quién es? What’s happening? **EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** **SOFIA** (*breathless, almost whimpering*) Mom, please, open up! Inside, the rattling of the locks seems like a symphony of torment for Sofia. Margarita finally opens the door, revealing her puzzled expression, but before she can say a word— **SOFIA** (*rushing words out*) Mami, move! —Sofia tries to barge in, but Margarita, concerned and confused, reaches out and grips Sofia, fearing something is terribly wrong. **MARGARITA** (*gripping Sofia*) ¿Qué te pasa, mija? What's wrong? Sofia squirms in her mother’s grasp. **SOFIA** (*pleading*) Just let me in, please! They're caught in an awkward dance as Margarita’s maternal instincts kick into full gear, stopping Sofia's beeline to inside the safety of home. **EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS** The standoff reaches a climax. Sofia's face contorts; the battle is lost. A muffled groan escapes her as she struggles less now, her body slackening. **MARGARITA** (*bewildered*) Sofia? **SOFIA** (*softly, as she recedes*) Oh Dios, it’s too late... Sofia begins relieving herself right there, letting nature's call overtake her. She emits grunts of exertion mixed with guilty relief. **MARGARITA** Why are you squatting? ¿Estás bien? Sofia continues, responding amidst grunts. **SOFIA** I...just... ¡Ay, qué alivio! Margarita's face is a blend of confusion and growing realization, staring as her daughter manages a conflicted grimace of concentration and release. **MARGARITA** (*inquiring softly*) Sofia, mi amor, ¿qué haces? Uncomfortable silence fills the room, punctuated only by Sofia's strained relief. **CLOSE-UP ON SOFIA** Her face is a canvas of emotions as she finds solace in the inevitable. She whisper-grunts, savoring the moment of release. The stench starts to fill the room as Margarita sniffs the air, her face scrunching up as she processes the odor. **MARGARITA** (*sniffing*) ¿Qué es ese olor? **SOFIA** (*sheepishly*) Um... With a final sniff, the dreadful realization crashes over Margarita. **MARGARITA** (*with disgusted realization*) Is that... are you...? Sofia stands mute, mortified. Margarita steps closer, pinching her nostrils, and probes more directly. **MARGARITA** (*pressingly*) Did you... in your pants? **SOFIA** (*avoiding the question*) Can I please just go inside now? Margarita steps aside with a grimace, beckoning Sofia in with a gesture of impatience. Inside, Sofia waddles awkwardly, cupping the seat of her pants. Margarita's astonishment peaks. **MARGARITA** (*sternly*) Wait, don't walk around. We can't have that dropping on the floor. Sofia halts, looking even more sheepish. **MARGARITA** (*tauntingly*) You pooped in your pants, what, are you a little girl? **SOFIA** (*maintaining composure*) Mami, this is your fault; you blocked me! **MARGARITA** (*indignantly*) Excuses! You just stood there and finished! **SOFIA** (*defiant*) I had to, it was too much pressure! It’s all on you, mami. **MARGARITA** (*mocking*) Nasty! It’s like you enjoyed... **CLOSE-UP ON MARGARITA AS SHE INSPECTS SOFIA** Margarita, partially repulsed and partially curious, turns Sofia around: the bulge in her shorts is impossible to miss. She can’t help but mock her. **MARGARITA** Look at you, so full. **SOFIA** (*defensive*) It needed to come out! **MARGARITA** You shouldn’t have been in this position! **SOFIA** (*resignedly*) Well, it does smell, doesn't it? Margarita can’t resist jabbing Sofia further. **MARGARITA** You won’t be staying smelly like that. Bathroom. Now. Squatting and half-dragging her to the bathroom, Margarita continues to grumble while Sofia cringes in humiliation. **SOFIA** (*worried*) Some might slide down... **MARGARITA** (*adamant*) Don’t you dare, mija! Finally, they reach the bathroom. Sofia stops, grinning mischievously. **SOFIA** (*teasing*) Wanna change my poopy diaper, mami? Margarita, affronted, firmly pushes Sofia into the bathroom, her hand squashing against the soiled fabric in distaste. **MARGARITA** Get in there, you dirty girl! Sofia protests as she stumbles inside. **SOFIA** (*disgusted*) Ay, it’s spreading! Margarita forcefully shuts the bathroom door behind a defiled Sofia, leaving her to deal with the aftermath alone. **MARGARITA** (*to herself*) Ay, my daughter, when will you grow up... FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"The screenplay is slightly too truncated. Please rewrite it and fix that. Also, please make the dialogues sound more natural.","completion":"**INT. FAMILY APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY** Amid the familiar sounds of an intimate apartment complex, *SOFIA RAMIREZ*, 20, Mexican American sophomore with long wavy hair tied in a high ponytail, athletic and dressed in a college track suit sans logos, dashes towards her door. The strain is evident on her face—something is wrong. **CUT TO:** **SOFIA** digging through her backpack, her movements hurried, her forehead creased with worry. Her fitness tracker beeps, ignored as her search becomes more desperate. **CUT BACK TO:** The street outside the complex earlier, where Sofia had grabbed street food from a vendor—a risky choice on a day of back-to-back classes. Now, the consequences were catching up, fast. **EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** Sofia's search ends in frustration; the keys are gone. Her hands tremble as they move to knock, firstly light and controlled, rapidly escalating to a desperate pounding. **INSIDE THE APARTMENT** The pounding is deafening in the quiet family apartment, resonating through the cheerful spaces vibrant with Mexican cultural motifs and plants, startling *MARGARITA RAMIREZ*, 48, a warm, quick-to-smile woman with streaks of gray in her traditional long hair, away from a simmering pot. **MARGARITA** (*quizzically*) ¿Quién es? ¿Qué pasa? Margarita moves toward the door with concern, wiping her hands on the colorful apron that matches the decor. **EXT. FAMILY APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS** **SOFIA** (*near tears*) ¡Mamá, ábreme por favor! Margarita's nimble fingers work the lock, but the moments stretch into an eternity for Sofia. The door creaks open, only for Margarita to find herself face-to-face with her daughter in utter distress. **MARGARITA** (*searching Sofia's face*) ¿Qué te pasa, mija? **SOFIA** (*pained, urgent*) Just—move, please! Sofia's attempt to push past gets thwarted as Margarita, still not understanding, instinctively grabs her daughter to provide aid. **INT. FAMILY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS** The urgency pushes Sofia to her limits. We see the struggle in her eyes, a silent plea for release, as she is caught by her mother's loving grip. **MARGARITA** (*growing alarmed*) Talk to me, Sofia. What’s— The plea turns into a whimper, the battle is lost on home ground. Sofia deflates under her mother's hands, the internal struggle reaching a somber conclusion. **SOFIA** (*resigned, defeated*) It's too late, Ma. I— She tries to regain her composure, but a soft grunt slips out. Margarita's eyes widen in dawning realization as Sofia's bodily functions take over, her postures lending to necessity. **MARGARITA** (*as if to a child*) ¿Qué haces, Sofia? **SOFIA** (*with mixed regret and relief*) I can't... Oh, alivio. Margarita's expression is torn between maternal apprehension and the absurdity of the situation, surveying Sofia's contorted face, a muddled mix of relief and mortification. **CUT TO:** Tight on Sofia as she unabashedly commits to the act, no words, just a world-weary sigh. The air grows heavy with the inevitable odor. Margarita catches the scent, her nose wrinkling. She sniffs again, disbelief etched on her features. **MARGARITA** (*sniffing, at a loss*) That smell, ¿es—? Sofia meets her mother's gaze, her face crumpled with sheepish embarrassment. More silence, punctured only by the grave reality of the scents that fill the room. Margarita's eyes grow wide, her worst suspicions confirmed. **MARGARITA** (*horrified comprehension*) No me digas que...you didn’t— Sofia stands frozen, wordlessly pleading as her mother steps closer, squinting her eyes against the pungent odor. **MARGARITA** (*insistent*) You pooped your pants? Right now? Sofia shifts uncomfortably, the words unspoken but evident in her demeanor. **SOFIA** Can we not do this here? Let me in? **MARGARITA** (*eyes wide, allowing entry*) Go, rápido. Sofia shuffles past, each step ginger and laden, her hands cradling her soiled condition. Margarita halts her a few paces in. **MARGARITA** (*voice rising, a mock*) No more steps. Do you understand? Sofia remains rooted, her embarrassment deepening. **MARGARITA** (*taunting*) A grown woman, with pants full of—No puede ser! **SOFIA** (*playful defiance clouding her shame*) You were in the way! Qué no ves? **MARGARITA** (*refusing the blame*) Nunca. At your age? Sofia's cheeks color as she stands her ground. **SOFIA** It was too much. It had to go somewhere! **MARGARITA** Nasty! You talk as if— **CLOSE-UP ON MARGARITA'S FACE** As her eyes wander down to Sofia's rear. She turns her daughter around, incredulous at the unexpected load. A cavity of concern mixes with teasing laughter. **MARGARITA** Look at you, such a mess. **SOFIA** (*half-heartedly protesting*) It was—there was so much. **MARGARITA** (*mockingly gentle*) No excuses, mija. **SOFIA** (*resolutely*) But... it's the truth. Margarita fights off a smirk as she playfully scolds. **MARGARITA** Terrible. You need cleaning. Ahora. Margarita, somehow still motherly in her rebukes, begins guiding Sofia to the bathroom, each of her complaints met with Sofia's meek nods. The odor lingers as they progress, holding the mood between comedy and the discomforts of reality. **SOFIA** (*cringing*) I feel like it's going to— **MARGARITA** (*determined*) Be careful! As they reach the bathroom door, Sofia turns back, a mischievous glint in her eye that belies the sullied state of her attire. **SOFIA** (*with a grin*) Need help with my diaper change? The teasing is too much for Margarita, any lingering patience snaps. She shoos Sofia inside, her hand firmly pressing against the unsavory bulk of her daughter's accident. **MARGARITA** (*nose wrinkling*) Inside, ya! Sofia recoils as she's pushed in, the action spreading her soiled shame further. **SOFIA** (*yelping*) Ma! It's all over! But Margarita, all business now, thrusts her daughter into the bathroom's sanctity, her gesture final. **MARGARITA** (*vehement*) For that joke? Deserved. The door shuts behind Sofia. Margarita stands outside, looking to the ceiling in resignation. **MARGARITA** Talking to herself as she walks away Mija, it's time you learned... **FADE OUT.**"},{"prompt":"Quand le passeport de M.

Исходя из этих данных, можно сделать несколько наблюдений: 1. Общая численность воспитанников в дошкольных учреждениях Приморского края снизилась с 86,193 в 2021 году до 84,472 в 2022 году. Это падение составило 1,721 ребенка или около 2%. 2. Численность воспитанников частных дошкольных учреждений также немного снизилась: с 1,054 в 2021 году до 1,003 в 2022 году, что составляет снижение на 51 ребенка или около 4.8%. 3. Удельный вес частных дошкольных учреждений незначительно снизился с 1.22% в 2021 году до 1.19% в 2022 году. Таким образом, в Приморском крае наблюдается общее снижение численности детей в дошкольных учреждениях, а также небольшое снижение доли детей, обучающихся в частных дошкольных учреждениях, в общей численности воспитанников. Это может быть связано с рядом факторов, включая демографические изменения, изменения в предпочтениях родителей относительно форм собственности дошкольных учреждений, экономические условия региона или другие социальные факторы.

아시나요?","completion":"네, 신용카드 연말정산 공제에 대해 설명드릴게요. 다만 제가 알려드릴 정보는 2023년 기준으로 저의 지식이 멈춰 있기 때문에 최신의 정확한 정보를 얻기 위해서는 국세청 또는 해당 국가의 세무 관련 공공기관의 안내를 참조해야 합니다. 대한민국에서는 개인이 사용한 신용카드, 체크카드 및 현금영수증 사용액에 대해 연말정산 시 일정 부분을 소득공제로 받을 수 있습니다. 이 공제는 개인의 소비를 장려하고 신용거래에 대한 투명성을 높이기 위해 마련되었습니다. 공제 규정은 해마다 다소 변동될 수 있지만, 기본적으로 다음과 같은 점을 유념해야 합니다: 1. 총급여의 일정 비율을 초과하는 카드 사용 금액에 대해서 공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 이는 소득 수준에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다. 2. 신용카드는 사용 금액의 15%, 체크카드 및 현금영수증은 30% 정도를 공제해주는 게 일반적입니다. 이러한 비율은 정책에 따라 변동될 수 있습니다. 3. 특정 업종(예: 유흥업소, 골프장 등)에서 사용한 비용은 공제 대상에서 제외될 수 있습니다. 4. 신용카드 공제 한도에는 상한선이 있으며, 고소득자는 제한이 더 강화될 수 있습니다. 5. 의료비, 교육비, 기부금 등은 별도의 세액공제 항목으로 분류되며 이에 대한 공제 비율과 한도가 달라질 수 있습니다. 신용카드 연말정산 공제를 정확히 이해하고 적절히 활용하려면 본인의 소득 수준, 사용된 신용카드 금액 등 여러 변수를 고려해야 합니다. 연말정산 시기에는 국세청 홈택스 서비스 등을 통해 자신의 사용 내역을 확인하고, 필요하다면 세무 전문가의 조언을 구하는 것이 좋습니다. 이 외에도 자주 변경되는 세법이기 때문에 연말정산을 준비할 때는 항상 최신 정보를 확인해야 합니다."},{"prompt":"자녀가 500만원 이상을 벌때는 어떻게되나요?","completion":"자녀가 연간 500만 원 이상의 소득이 있는 경우, 대한민국 세법에서 어떻게 처리되는지 말씀드리겠습니다. 이는 가족의 소득 및 재산상황에 따른 세무 처리에 관련한 사항입니다. 1. 자녀 세대 분리: 자녀가 연간 500만 원 이상의 소득이 있다면 주로 자녀를 부모와는 별도의 세대로 간주하여 세금 신고를 해야 하는 경우가 많습니다. 이는 부모가 더 이상 자녀에 대한 기본공제, 교육비 공제 등 다양한 세금 공제 혜택을 받을 수 없음을 의미할 수 있습니다. 2. 부양가족 공제 제한: 부모는 보통 자녀가 자신들의 소득세 신고에서 부양가족으로 공제받을 수 있는데, 자녀가 일정 소득 이상을 벌게 되면 이 공제를 받을 수 없습니다. 2023년 기준으로 신용카드 연말정산 공제와 연계하여 이를 체크하는 것은 자녀의 소득 여부에 따라 달라질 것입니다. 3. 자녀 소득세 신고: 자녀 본인이 독립적으로 소득세 신고를 해야 하는 경우, 자녀의 소득, 공제항목, 납부해야 할 세금 등에 대해 별도로 계산이 이루어져야 합니다. 자녀의 소득 여부와 소득 금액에 따라서 연말정산에서 부모와 자녀가 어떤 식으로 공제를 받을 수 있는지, 자녀가 부모의 세금 신고에서 어떻게 처리되어야 하는지가 결정됩니다. 따라서 자녀가 500만 원 이상을 벌 때는, 자녀의 소득세 신고 및 부모의 공제 가능 여부를 검토해야 합니다. 자녀의 소득과 관련된 정확한 처리 방법은 세법의 최신 개정 사항과 국세청의 지침에 따라 달라질 수 있으므로, 최신 정보를 확인해야 합니다. 필요한 경우 세무 전문가나 국세청의 상담을 받는 것이 좋습니다."},{"prompt":"호주 워킹홀리데이중인 자녀가 500만원 이상 벌었을때 이는 공제 대상인가요 아닌가요?","completion":"호주에서 워킹홀리데이를 진행하는 동안 자녀가 벌어들인 소득에 대한 대한민국의 세법 처리는 몇 가지 요인에 따라 달라집니다. 세법은 시간에 따라 변할 수 있으므로, 실제 적용은 해당 연도의 세법과 국세청의 지침에 의존합니다. 일반적으로, 대한민국의 거주자는 세계 소득에 대해 과세되므로, 본국의 거주자로 분류되는 자녀가 해외에서 벌어들인 소득은 원칙적으로 세금 신고 대상이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 아래의 사항을 고려해야 합니다: 1. **거주자 여부**: 만약 자녀가 국외에 장기간 거주하여 대한민국의 비거주자로 분류된다면, 대한민국 내에서 발생한 소득에 대해서만 세금이 과세됩니다. 2. **양국 간 조세 조약**: 대한민국과 호주 간에는 조세 조약이 있으므로, 이 조약에 따라 양국 거주자의 해외소득에 대한 과세 규정이 달라질 수 있습니다. 어떤 국가에서 세금을 납부할 의무가 있는지, 이중과세를 피하기 위한 규정이 어떻게 적용되는지를 확인해야 합니다. 3. **공제 대상 여부**: 자녀가 벌어들인 소득이 대한민국 내에서 공제 대상여부는 자녀의 거주 상태와 세법에서 정의하는 소득 범주에 따라 달라집니다. 대한민국의 거주자로 남아 있다면, 그 소득은 세금 신고에 포함되야 하고, 부모의 공제 대상 자녀로서 인정되지 않을 수 있습니다. 4. **소득 신고**: 자녀가 해외 소득에 대해 한국 세무서에 신고를 해야 하는 경우, 자녀는 본인의 소득에 대한 세무 처리를 별도로 하고, 부모는 자녀를 공제 대상에서 제외할 수 있습니다. 좀 더 구체적인 조언을 위해서는 세무 당국이나 세무 전문가에게 연락하여 자녀의 거주 상태, 소득, 그리고 가족 간의 세무 처리에

Flaherty）执导的一部经典纪录片，它讲述了加拿大北部伊努伊特人（Inuit）纳努克（Nanook）和他的家人在严酷的北极环境中生存的故事。这部电影在当时引起了广泛的关注，并成为纪录片的先驱之一，但同时也引发了关于纪录片中叙事性和真实性之间的矛盾的讨论。 首先，纪录片是由导演主观地选择、剪辑和组织素材来呈现真实事件。弗拉哈蒂在拍摄《北方的纳努克》时并不是简单地记录纳努克和他的家人的日常生活，而是经过精心策划和安排来拍摄镜头。他加入了一些“刻意”的场景和情节，例如捕猎场景、钓鱼场景和建造伊格卢（Inuit的传统居所）的场景。通过这些安排，弗拉哈蒂试图展示伊努伊特人的生活方式和文化，并创造一个对观众有吸引力的故事。 然而，这种叙事性的安排也导致了纪录片中真实性的质疑。纪录片本来应该是真实的记录现实事件，但《北方的纳努克》的安排和演员的出场使得部分镜头显得不真实。例如，在纳努克狩猎场景中，弗拉哈蒂通过多次的镜头安排来展示纳努克的捕猎过程，这明显是为了增加紧张感和戏剧性。此外，一些情节和场景被刻意安排，以满足观众的期待和好奇心，例如影片最著名的一幕，纳努克和他的家人被巨大的海象追逐的场景，但实际上这个场景是弗拉哈蒂自己创造的。 这些安排和演员的出场给观众留下了一个问题：纪录片到底是一部真正的记录还是一部虚构故事？弗拉哈蒂试图在电影中展示伊努伊特人的生活，并给观众一种身临其境的感觉，但同时也不可避免地制造了一些情节和情景。这就是纪录片中叙事性和真实性之间的矛盾。观众需要在欣赏纪录片时保持一定的警惕，分辨出哪些是真实的记录，哪些是导演的安排和创造。 总之，纪录片《北方的纳努克》作为一部经典的纪录片，展示了叙事性和真实性之间的矛盾。导演弗拉哈蒂在纪录片中安排了许多情节和场景，以营造一个对观众有吸引力的故事，但这也导致了纪录片真实性的质疑。观众需要保持警惕，以辨别纪录片中的真实记录和导演的创作。"},{"prompt":"《北方的纳努克》举例，这一部被称之为历史上第一部全长纪录片，却也因为摆拍被世人所诟病。在影片之中，当时很多的捕猎工具和方法早已被爱斯基摩人所淘汰，但导演为了所谓的原始性，也为了引发“现代人”的好奇而形成的商业影响，进行了摆拍，这便使得所谓的记录失去了真实色彩，带上了主观特点。再加入苏珊桑塔格中关于被摄物的理论阐述加以分析","completion":"对于《北方的纳努克》这部被称为历史上第一部全长纪录片的影片，摆拍的问题确实存在，导致了其真实性丧失的争议。 在影片中，弗拉哈蒂导演为了呈现所谓的原始性和引发现代观众的好奇心，进行了一些摆拍行为。例如，爱斯基摩人实际上已经不再使用的捕猎工具和方法被展现出来，用以营造原始和传统的感觉。这种刻意的造作不符合现实，并且以商业利益为导向，让观众更加吸引，从而形成了影片的商业影响力。这种摆拍行为使得影片失去了真实性，带上了导演主观特点和商业考量。 苏珊·桑塔格提出了被摄物（the photographed subject）的概念，称摄影或者纪录片在记录被摄物时，也不可避免地加入了自身的意图与观点。在《北方的纳努克》的例子中，弗拉哈蒂导演在选择被摄物时，有意强调原始性和传统文化，这是他的主观意图的体现。摆拍和营造原始感不仅是为了激发观众对原始生活的好奇心，同时也是为了满足商业利益，增加了影片的商业成功。 然而，正如桑塔格所指出的，摄影和纪录片展现的不是客观真实，而是摄影者自己的观点虚构的创造。在《北方的纳努克》中，导演的摆拍行为和商业考虑让观众无法分辨影片中的真实记录和导演的创作。纪录片的真实性存在矛盾，观众需要进行主动的批判性思考来辨别影片中的真实与虚构。 综上所述，《北方的纳努克》这部被称为历史上第一部全长纪录片，由于摆拍行为导致了真实性的丧失。导演的主观意图和商业考虑加入了摄影者对被摄物的改造和创造，使得影片失去了客观真实的色彩。苏珊·桑塔格关于被摄物的理论可以用来分析影片中导演的创作意图和观众的理解态度，指引我们批判性地思考纪录片的真实性。"},{"prompt":"苏珊桑塔格《论摄影》主要讲了什么","completion":"《论摄影》（On Photography）是苏珊·桑塔格（Susan Sontag）于1977年出版的一本著作，它是一本分析照片与摄影的文化和哲学意义的重要著作。以下是该书的主要内容概述： 1. 影像与现实：苏珊·桑塔格认为，照片作为影像媒介可以捕捉并展现真实世界，它们成为了我们对世界的观察和体验的重要媒介，同时也对我们对现实进行了影响和塑造。 2. 照片的权力和伦理：桑塔格关注照片的权力问题，即摄影可以具有操纵和控制的力量。她认为摄影师选择拍摄的主题和角度，以及照片的呈现方式都对我们的认知和理解产生着影响。同时，她还提出了照片伦理的问题，即摄影是否有权力去展现他人的隐私和苦难。 3. 照片的褒义和贬义：桑塔格探讨了照片作为一种艺术形式的价值和意义。她指出，照片可以美化和赋予场景以艺术价值，但同时也可能使我们陷入虚假的观念和刻板化的印象。她关注照片的真实性和虚构性之间的张力，并探讨了摄影师如何塑造和影响观众的视觉和情感体验。 4. 照片的记忆和历史：桑塔格探讨了照片作为记忆和历史的载体的作用。她认为照片可以帮助我们保存和传承历史，并对过去的事件和人物产生更深入的理解和关注。但她也指出，照片可能歪曲历史和记忆，通过选择性的记录和呈现方式来操纵观众的理解和记忆。 综上所述，《论摄影》是苏珊·桑塔格的一本重要著作，主要探讨了照片和摄影的文化和哲学意义。其中包括影像与现实、照片的权力和伦理、照片的褒义和贬义，以及照片的记忆和历史等议题。这本书帮助我们更全面地理解照片的作用和影响，以及摄影师和观众之间的关系。"},{"prompt":"Chapter1纪录片的发展历史 1.1纪录片作为一种媒体形式 1.2纪录片分为哪些种类 1.3纪录片的核心 Chapter2

Adding a WHERE clause to a query allows you to specify conditions that the rows must meet in order to be included in the result set.

Atrasis is a female, Atradalus was a male. Both are born in April 4, 1924. Both have an IQ of 230, and both are blessed with immortality. Timeline ends in 1930.","completion":"As an AI, I have no records of Atrasis Fireheim and Atradalus Fireheim born on April 4, 1924, with an IQ of 230 and immortality, as you described. This scenario seems to stem from a fictional or hypothetical narrative rather than historical facts up until my knowledge cutoff in 2023. If these characters are part of a creative work or a piece of fiction you are developing or inquiring about, you could further embellish their story as it fits your narrative since the timeline you've given ends in 1930, and there would be no historical record of their actions or lives beyond that time due to the supposed immortality. In a fictional context, characters with such high intelligence and immortality could have a profound impact on the world, potentially influencing science, technology, medicine, politics, philosophy, and other aspects of human development over the decades. Their experiences and knowledge accumulation could be a fascinating exploration of the human (or superhuman) condition. If you're asking for help in developing a story or understanding the implications of immortality and extreme intelligence, here are a few possible plot points you could consider: 1. **Adaptation to Change**: Throughout history, the world has undergone massive changes. How do beings who live forever adapt to the constant evolution of society and technology? 2. **Secrecy and Discovery**: Would the twins hide their abilities and immortality? How would the world react if it found out about their existence? How do they maintain their secret over time, seeing as people around them age and they do not? 3. **Emotional Journey**: Immortality can also be a curse – watching loved ones age and die could take an emotional toll on the twins. 4. **Influence on Events**: If they have extreme intelligence, your characters might have been involved in key historical events, influencing outcomes in ways not recorded in our history books. 5. **Purpose and Goal**: With immortality and great intelligence, what goals might they set for themselves? Will they seek to guide humanity toward a better future subtly, or will they have more self-serving aims? 6. **Conflict**: What kind of conflicts might near-omniscient and immortal beings face? These might be internal conflicts, such as ethical dilemmas or psychological struggles, or external conflicts, like those opposing their influence or questioning their existence.

It is one of the most challenging U.S. permanent residence categories to qualify for, due to its high standard of eligibility. Extraordinary ability is defined as \\"a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.\\" To qualify for an EB-1A, you must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim and must be recognized in your field through extensive documentation. Here are the general criteria for qualifying for an EB-1A: 1. **Evidence of a one-time achievement**: This might be a major, internationally recognized award like a Nobel Prize or an Olympic Medal. 2. **Other evidence**: If you do not have such a one-time achievement, you must provide evidence of at least three of the following: - Receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence. - Membership in associations in the field which demand outstanding achievement of their members. - Published material about you in professional or major trade publications or other major media. - Being asked to judge the work of others, either individually or on a panel. - Original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business-related contributions of major significance to the field. - Authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media. - Work that has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases. - Performance in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation. - High salary or other significantly high remuneration in relation to others in the field. - Commercial successes in the performing arts. Qualifying for an EB-1A is typically reserved for individuals who are truly outstanding in their field. If you feel like you're an \\"ordinary person\\" without a public profile or significant achievements in these areas, it may be challenging to meet the criteria for an EB-1A green card. However, there are other categories of employment-based green cards that might be more appropriate depending on your situation, such as: - **EB-1B**: For outstanding professors and researchers. - **EB-1C**: For multinational managers and executives who meet certain criteria. - **EB-2**: For professionals holding advanced degrees or persons with exceptional ability. - **EB-3**: For skilled workers, professionals, and other workers. Each category has its own set of requirements and processes. If you are interested in pursuing an employment-based green card, it is often recommended to consult with an immigration attorney who can assess your specific situation and guide you through the available options. An attorney can also help you build and present a case if you do, in fact, have a background that might warrant consideration for an EB-1A through less obvious achievements and accolades."},{"prompt":"Androidon ha szokatlan forgalom van a loopback interfészen","completion":"Ha szokatlan forgalom van a loopback interfészen az Android készüléken, akkor ez általában a következő okok miatt történhet: 1.

Для построения нагрузочной прямой необходимы следующие данные: 1. Напряжение питания (Uпитания или Eп), которое в вашем случае равно 3 вольта. 2. Нагрузочное сопротивление (Rн), равное 200 Ом.

Исходя из предоставленных данных, мы стремимся вычислить номиналы резисторов в коллекторной Rк и эмиттерной Rэ цепях транзистора GT309A для заданных условий. Параметры указаны для некоторой схемы усилительного каскада на p-n-p транзисторе. При напряжении на выходе 1,5 вольта (Uвых) и нагрузочном сопротивлении 200 Ом (Rн), можно вычислить коллекторный ток (Iс) при работе усилителя: [ Iс = Uвых / Rн = 1,5 В / 200 Ом = 0,0075 А = 7,5 мА ] Этот ток также протекает через коллекторный резистор Rк. Падение напряжения на Rк (Uрк) можно определить, исходя из разности полного напряжения питания и напряжения на нагрузке: [ Uрк = Eп - Uвых = 3 В - 1,5 В = 1,5 В ] Теперь мы можем рассчитать Rк: [ Rк = Uрк / Iс = 1,5 В / 0,0075 А = 200 Ом ] Находим эмиттерное сопротивление Rэ. Как правило, в усилительных каскадах эмиттерный резистор служит для установления операционной точки и обеспечения температурной стабильности. Падение напряжения на эмиттерном резисторе (Uрэ) обычно берется небольшим, чтобы обеспечить как можно более высокое усиление. Величина Uрэ зависит от конструкции схемы, но возьмём для примера, что оно должно быть в районе 10% от напряжения питания, то есть: [ Uрэ = 0,1 times Eп = 0,1 times 3 В = 0,3 В ] Теперь рассчитаем Rэ: [ Rэ = Uрэ / Iс = 0,3 В / 0,0075 А = 40 Ом ] Итак, приблизительные величины резисторов для коллекторной и эмиттерной цепи при заданных условиях будут следующими: Rк примерно равен 200 Ом, а Rэ — около 40 Ом. Помните, что эти расчёты исходят из множества упрощений. На практике нужно учитывать дополнительные факторы, такие как ненулевое напряжение насыщения транзистора между коллектором и эмиттером, а также другие элементы схемы, которые влияют на точное значение тока коллектора.

Для начала предположим, что мы хотим максимально использовать допустимый ток коллектора транзистора, который составляет 15 мА (( I_{C,max} = 15 мА )), не превышая его, чтобы не вызвать повреждения устройства. ( I_{C,max} ) связан с амплитудным значением входного тока базы (( I_{B,max} )) следующим уравнением: [ I_{C,max} = I_{B,max} times beta ] где: - ( I_{C,max} ) — максимальный ток коллектора, - ( I_{B,max} ) — максимальное амплитудное значение входного тока базы, - ( beta ) — коэффициент усиления по току транзистора. Таким образом, ( I_{B,max} ) можно рассчитать как: [ I_{B,max} = frac{I_{C,max}}{beta} ] Чтобы определить ( I_{вх,max} ), вам потребуется знать ( beta ) вашего транзистора GT309A или аналогичный параметр ( h_{FE} ), который вы найдете в технической документации на устройство. Если у вас нет точного значения ( beta ), для типовых малосигнальных транзисторов можно использовать диапазон от 100 до 300. Предположим, что ( beta ) равно 200. Тогда: [ I_{B,max} = frac{15 мА}{200} = 0.075 мА ] Теперь, зная максимальное амплитудное значение входного тока базы ( I_{B,max} ), можно определить максимальное входное напряжение (( U_{вх,max} )), используя величину входного сопротивления базы (( R_{вх} )). Однако, поскольку значение ( R_{вх} ) не указано, мы ограничиваемся расчётом ( I_{вх,max} ), который равен ( I_{B,max} ). Это идеализированный расчёт, который не учитывает нелинейности характеристик транзистора, температурные вариации и другие факторы, влияющие на работу усилительного каскада в реальном устройстве. При проектировании схем на практике необходимо также учитывать запасы по максимальным токам и напряжениям для надежной работы усилителя."},{"prompt":"Определяем наибольшие амплитудные значения входного сигнала тока I вх max при h 21э = В = min = 20; max = 70","completion":"Основываясь на предоставленных вами значениях коэффициента усиления по току для транзистора ( h_{21э} = beta ), который лежит в диапазоне от 20 до 70, мы можем вычислить наибольшие амплитудные значения входного сигнала тока базы ( I_{вх,max} ), используя максимальный ток коллектора ( I_{C,max} ). Для нас важно выбрать такое значение ( I_{вх,max} ), которое бы не привело к превышению максимально допустимого тока коллектора независимо от вариаций ( beta ). Для этого используем минимальное значение ( beta ) при расчёте, так как меньшее значение ( beta ) приведёт к большему значению входного тока базы для того же тока коллектора. Итак, максимальный ток коллектора ( I_{C,max} ) равен 15 мА. Теперь рассчитаем ( I_{вх,max} ) для минимального значения ( beta ): [ I_{вх,max} = frac{I_{C,max}}{beta_{min}} ] [ I_{вх,max} = frac{15 мА}{20} = 0.75 мА ] Для минимального значения ( beta = 20 ), максимальный входной ток базы ( I_{вх,max} ) составит 0.75 мА (750 мкА). Это значение гарантирует, что даже при самом неблагоприятном случае, когда усиление транзистора минимально, ( I_{C,max} ) не будет превышен. При проектировании усилителя также важно учесть напряжение на резисторе последовательно соединённом с базой (если таковой имеется), чтобы гарантировать достаточную амплитуду входного сигнала на базе, не вводя искажения и не превышая максимальный ток базы.

Так как усиление по току больше, то нужно меньшее значение входного тока базы для получения того же максимально допустимого тока коллектора. Максимальный ток коллектора ( I_{C,max} ) равен 15 мА. Теперь рассчитаем ( I_{вх,min} ): [ I_{вх,min} = frac{I_{C,max}}{beta_{max}} ] [ I_{вх,min} = frac{15 мА}{70} approx 0.214 мА ] Таким образом, наименьшее амплитудное значение входного тока базы ( I_{вх,min} ), которое не будет превышать максимально допустимый ток коллектора даже при наибольшем усилении транзистора, составит около 0.214 мА или 214 мкА.

Для упрощения расчета предполагают, что основную роль в формировании входного сопротивления играет базовый резистор. Если схема содержит дополнительные эффекты обратной связи или другие элементы, включенные параллельно входу, то их также необходимо учитывать в расчетах. В общем случае, для p-n-p транзистора с общим эмиттером входное сопротивление по переменному току можно приблизительно рассчитать по формуле: [ R_{вх} approx beta cdot (R_{э} || R_{э,внешнее}) + R_{б,внешнее} ] где: - ( beta ) — коэффициент усиления транзистора по току (здесь ( h_{21э} )), - ( R_{э} ) — сопротивление эмиттерного резистора в схеме (если таковой имеется), - ( R_{э,внешнее} ) — сопротивление, подключенное параллельно эмиттерному резистору по переменному току (например, через конденсатор обхода), - ( R_{б,внешнее} ) — сопротивление базового резистора (при его наличии), - \\"||\\" — обозначает параллельное подключение. В ситуации, когда эмиттер подключен непосредственно к общей точке (земле) или через небольшой резистор (который может быть шунтирован конденсатором для целей усиления по переменному току), сопротивление ( R_{э,внешнее} ) можно считать очень маленьким или даже равным нулю. В таком случае, входное сопротивление каскада будет определяться в основном сопротивлением базового делителя напряжения. В вашем вопросе не указаны точные значения базовых и эмиттерных резисторов, поэтому для более точного расчета ( R_{вх} ) необходимо знать эти параметры схемы. Если базовый резистор отсутствует (то есть в базу подается входной сигнал напрямую), то ( R_{б,внешнее} ) также считается равным нулю. Если известно сопротивление эмиттерного резистора и предполагается, что ( R_{э} ) шунтируется конденсатором для сигнала переменного тока (т.е., для целей переменного тока ( R_{э,внешнее} approx 0 )), то ( R_{вх} ) оценивается как ( beta cdot R_{э} ). Для примера, предположим, что транзистор имеет средний коэффициент усиления по току ( beta ) равный 45, а эмиттерное сопротивление ( R_{э} ) составляет 1 кОм. Тогда упрощенно считаем: [ R_{вх} approx beta cdot R_{э} = 45 cdot 1000 Ом = 45000 Ом или 45 кОм ] Такой расчет предполагает, что базовый и эмиттерный резисторы являются единственными значимыми компонентами для определения входного сопротивления, и что другие факторы, такие как батареи входного сопротивления самого транзистора, внешние схемы обратной связи, и другие элементы в схеме не оказывают значимого влияния."},{"prompt":"Определяем сопротивление Rвх каскада по переменному току , 1.

Сопротивление входа транзистора по переменному току можно рассчитать при условии, что эмиттерный резистор ( R_{э} ) шунтирован конденсатором, что обычно и делается в аудиоусилителях низкой частоты для повышения коэффициента усиления. В таком случае формула для входного сопротивления транзистора по переменному току будет следующей: [ R_{вх} = r_{б} + (beta + 1) cdot r_{э} ] где: - ( r_{б} ) — сопротивление базы (внутреннее), - ( r_{э} ) — динамическое сопротивление эмиттерного перехода, - ( beta ) — текущий коэффициент усиления транзистора. Для упрощения расчетов, предположим что ( r_{б} ) мало и им можно пренебречь.

Для начала определите Iвх.max, которое зависит от минимального значения коэффициента усиления по току транзистора (h21э или β), так как это гарантирует, что при максимальной амплитуде входного сигнала коллекторный ток не превысит свое максимальное допустимое значение. В вашем случае, минимальное значение β = 20 и максимальный ток коллектора Ic.max = 15 мА: [ I_{вх.max} = frac{I_{C.max}}{beta_{min}} = frac{0.015,А}{20} = 0.00075,А = 0.75,мА ] Исходя из расчета, максимальный амплитудный входной ток базы Iвх.max составляет 0.75 мА.

Во многих схемах с общим эмиттером эмиттерный резистор Rэ шунтируется по переменному току конденсатором для увеличения коэффициента усиления. Этот конденсатор эффективно устраняет Rэ из схемы для переменного тока, так что входное сопротивление становится равным: [ R_{вх} approx r_{б} + (beta + 1) cdot r_{э} ] где rб — сопротивление базы (обычно мало для маломощных транзисторов и может быть пренебрежимо малым), β — коэффициент усиления тока транзистора, rэ — внутреннее сопротивление эмиттера. Внутреннее сопротивление эмиттера rэ можно приближенно оценить по формуле: [ r_{э} approx frac{26,мВ}{I_{Э}} ] где 26 мВ — тепловое напряжение при комнатной температуре, IЭ — ток эмиттера. Для типовой работы транзистора, ( I_{Э} ) близок к току коллектора ( I_{C} ), который составляет 15 мA. Однако, для точного расчета Rвх, требуется знать дополнительные параметры схемы, такие как значения резисторов в цепи базы, присутствие и значения конденсаторов шунтирующих резисторы, и другие нет описанных здесь элементов. Если принять, что внешних резисторов на входе нет, можно использовать упомянутую выше формулу для оценки Rвх. Таким образом, для расчета нам нужно определить ток эмиттера IЭ, который равен току коллектора IС, и воспользоваться значениями βmin и βmax для оценки диапазона Rвх. [ r_{э} approx frac{26,мВ}{0.015,А} approx 1.73,Ом ] Теперь рассчитаем Rвх для двух значений β: Для βmin = 20: [ R_{вх,min} approx (beta_{min} + 1) cdot r_{э} approx (20 + 1) cdot 1.73,Ом approx 36.33,Ом ] Для βmax = 70: [ R_{вх,max} approx (beta_{max} + 1) cdot r_{э} approx (70 + 1) cdot 1.73,Ом approx 122.83,Ом ] Так мы получаем оценку входного сопротивления по переменному току усилителя, которая лежит в пределах от примерно 36.33 Ом до 122.83 Ом в зависимости от фактического значения коэффициента усиления транзистора.

На основе этих данных и общего напряжения питания ( V_{CC} ), можно было бы определить значения ( R_1 ) и ( R_2 ) следующим образом: Сначала определим ток делителя ( I_{делитель} ), который обычно в 10 раз больше, чем базовый ток, чтобы обеспечить стабильность рабочей точки: [ I_{делитель} = I_B times 10 ] Тогда напряжение на входе транзистора будет равно: [ V_{BE} = I_B times R_2 ] И напряжение на ( R_1 ) будет: [ V_{R_1} = V_{CC} - V_{BE} ] Используя закон Ома, мы можем определить ( R_1 ) и ( R_2 ) так: [ R_1 = frac{V_{R_1}}{I_{делитель}} ] [ R_2 = frac{V_{BE}}{I_{делитель}} ] Теперь, если суммарное сопротивление ( R_{1-2} ) известно и равно 1.56 Ом, выражение для него будет следующим: [ R_{1-2} = R_1 + R_2 = 1.56,Ом ] Таким образом, зная ( V_{BE} ), ( I_B ), и ( V_{CC} ), вы могли бы решить систему уравнений с двумя неизвестными ( R_1 ) и ( R_2 ), чтобы найти их значения, удовлетворяющие суммарному сопротивлению 1.56 Ом.

Spieghiamola nel dettaglio: [ vec{tau} = vec{r}_{C/O} times (-Mgvec{j}) = -MgRsin(theta)vec{k} ] - ( vec{tau} ) è il vettore del momento torcente. - ( vec{r}_{C/O} ) è il vettore posizione del centro di massa C del cerchio rispetto al punto di cerniera O. - ( -Mgvec{j} ) è la forza di gravità, dove ( M ) è la massa del cerchio, ( g ) è l'accelerazione di gravità che punta verso il basso nella direzione negativa dell'asse y (rappresentato dal vettore unitario ( vec{j} )). - ( vec{k} ) è un vettore unitario che indica la direzione della rotazione lungo l'asse z (che punta fuori dal piano della pagina o dello schermo se l'asse x è orizzontale e l'asse y è verticale). - ( R ) è il raggio del cerchio. - ( theta ) è l'angolo tra la direzione verticale verso il basso e il raggio che va dalla cerniera al centro di massa, misurato in senso antiorario. Poiché stiamo considerando il moto in un piano verticale e il vettore posizione ( vec{r}_{C/O} ) va dalla cerniera al centro di massa formando un angolo ( theta ) con la verticale, la lunghezza di questo vettore è il raggio ( R ) del cerchio. La forza di gravità agisce esattamente in direzione opposta rispetto al vettore unitario ( vec{j} ), quindi la sua direzione è ( -Mgvec{j} ). Il prodotto vettoriale ( times ) tra il vettore posizione e la forza calcola il momento torcente. Per il prodotto vettoriale, bisogna considerare la componente perpendicolare della forza rispetto alla leva, che in questo caso è rappresentata da ( Rsin(theta) ), ovvero la proiezione di ( R ) sulla direzione perpendicolare alla forza di gravità che agisce sul centro di massa (la componente lungo il raggio che va dalla cerniera al centro di massa lungo la direzione del moto). Infine il momento torcente sarà diretto lungo l'asse z (determinato dalla regola della mano destra per i prodotti vettoriali), quindi compare il ( vec{k} ). Il segno meno indica che il momento torcente cerca di riportare il pendolo verso il basso (il momento è in direzione opposta all'angolo di spostamento (theta)), allineandolo con la direzione della forza di gravità, questo si accorda con il fatto che il moto è oscillatorio e non unidirezionale."},{"prompt":"salut","completion":"Salut!

La manière dont vous accédez aux valeurs \`textsize\` et \`color\` (qui sont passées au widget parent) dans votre classe \`_MyWidgetState\` doit être ajustée. Dans une classe \`State\`, vous pouvez accéder aux valeurs passées au \`StatefulWidget\` correspondant via l'objet \`widget\`. Par example, pour accéder à la variable \`color\` vous devriez écrire \`widget.color\`, et pour \`textsize\` vous devriez écrire \`widget.textsize\`. Voici comment vous pouvez modifier la classe \`_MyWidgetState\` pour faire cela : \`\`\`dart class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> { int _currentQuestion = 0; // Supprimez le mot-clé final ici si vous envisagez de modifier cette valeur final List<Question> _questions = [ // ... vos questions ]; @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { // ... // Utilisez \`widget.color\` pour accéder à la couleur, et \`widget.textsize\` pour la taille du texte. return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( // ... ), backgroundColor: widget.color, // Changez ceci body: Center( child: Column( // ... style: TextStyle( color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic, fontSize: widget.textsize, // Changez ceci ), // ... ), ), // ... ); } // Les autres méthodes restent les mêmes } \`\`\` Avec cette approche, même si vous avez un \`StatefulWidget\`, les valeurs \`color\` et \`textsize\` sont toujours immuables et définies lors de la création de \`MyWidget\`. Elles peuvent être utilisées de manière constante via \`widget.color\` et \`widget.textsize\` à l'intérieur de la méthode \`build\` de la classe \`_MyWidgetState\`. Pour le reste de votre code, il semble correct sur la base de l'exemple que vous avez donné. L'utilisation de \`setState\` est appropriée pour mettre à jour votre état local \`_currentQuestion\`, ce qui va reconstruire votre widget à chaque changement de question. Assurez-vous que lorsque vous appelez \`_checkAnswer(true)\`, par exemple, vous devez aussi passer le contexte à cette méthode : \`\`\`dart ElevatedButton(onPressed: ()=> _checkAnswer(true, context), // ... \`\`\` Il en va de même pour l'autre bouton qui appelle \`_checkAnswer(false)\`. De plus, dans l'implémentation actuelle, vos méthodes \`_previousQuestion\` et \`_nextQuestion\` n'ont plus besoin d'être modulaires (en utilisant le \`% _questions.length\`), car elles devraient incrémente ou décrémenter simplement \`_currentQuestion\` selon les règles métier que vous souhaitez appliquer (par exemple, revenir à zéro après la dernière question, ou s'arrêter à la première/dernière question sans boucler)."},{"prompt":"import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart'; import 'package:appli_mobile/modele/question.dart'; import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget { final Color color; final double textsize; const MyWidget(this.color, this.textsize); @override State<MyWidget> createState() => _MyWidgetState(); } class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> { int _currentQuestion = 0; final List _questions = [Question.name(\\"The question number 1 is a very long question and her answer is true.\\", true, \\"flag.png\\"), Question.name(\\"The question number 2 is true again.\\", true, \\"img.png\\"), Question.name(\\"The question number 3 is false.\\", false, \\"img.png\\"), Question.name(\\"The question number 4 is false again.\\", false, \\"flag.png\\"), Question.name(\\"The question number 5 is true.\\", true, \\"flag.png\\"), Question.name(\\"The question number 6 is true again.\\", true, \\"img.png\\"),]; @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { final ButtonStyle myButtonStyle = ElevatedButton.styleFrom( backgroundColor: Colors.blueGrey.shade900, padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 20), shape: const RoundedRectangleBorder( borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(20)), ) ); return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: const Text(\\"Quizz app\\"), centerTitle: true, backgroundColor: Colors.lightBlue, ), backgroundColor: widget.color, body: Center( child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly, children: [ Image.asset(\\"images/gregmma.jpg\\", width: 250, height: 180,), Container( decoration: BoxDecoration( color: Colors.transparent, borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(15), border: Border.all( color: Colors.black,style: BorderStyle.solid, ) ), height: 120.0, child: Padding( padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0), child: Text( _questions[_currentQuestion].questionText, textDirection: TextDirection.ltr, style: TextStyle( color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, fontStyle: FontStyle.italic, fontSize: widget.textsize, ), ), ) ), Row( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly, children: [ ElevatedButton(onPressed: ()=> _previousQuestion(), style: myButtonStyle, child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_back, color: Colors.white,), ), ElevatedButton(onPressed: ()=> _checkAnswer(true, context), style: myButtonStyle, child: const Text(\\"TRUE\\", style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),), ElevatedButton(onPressed: ()=> _checkAnswer(false, context), style: myButtonStyle, child: const Text(\\"FALSE\\", style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),), ElevatedButton(onPressed: ()=> _nextQuestion(), style:myButtonStyle, child: const Icon(Icons.arrow_forward, color: Colors.white,),), ] ) ] ) ) ); } void _previousQuestion() { setState(() { _currentQuestion = (_currentQuestion-1)%_questions.length; }); } void _nextQuestion() { setState(() { _currentQuestion = (_currentQuestion+1)%_questions.length; }); } void _checkAnswer(bool choice, BuildContext context) { if (choice == _questions[_currentQuestion].isCorrect){ debugPrint(\\"good\\"); const mySnackBar = SnackBar( content: Text(\\"GOOD ANSWER!!!\\",style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20)), duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), backgroundColor: Colors.lightGreen, width: 180.0, // Width of the SnackBar. padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric( horizontal: 8.0, // Inner padding for SnackBar content. ), behavior: SnackBarBehavior.floating, shape: RoundedRectangleBorder( borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(20)), ),); ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(mySnackBar); }else{ debugPrint(\\"bad\\"); const mySnackBar = SnackBar( content: Text(\\"BAD ANSWER!!!\\",style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),), duration: Duration(milliseconds: 500), backgroundColor: Colors.red, width: 180.0, // Width of the SnackBar. padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric( horizontal: 8.0, // Inner padding for SnackBar content. ), behavior: SnackBarBehavior.floating, shape: RoundedRectangleBorder( borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(20)), ),); ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(mySnackBar); } _nextQuestion(); } } comment changer la taille du texte des questions ?","completion":"Dans votre code actuel, vous avez déjà implémenté un moyen de modifier la taille du texte des questions à travers la propriété \`textsize\` que vous passez au \`MyWidget\`.

Cette commande compile l'application et l'installe sur votre appareil. Si vous effectuez des modifications dans votre code et que vous relancez l'application avec \`flutter run\`, vous verrez ces modifications reflétées dans l'application sur votre appareil. Cependant, si vous n'utilisez pas \`flutter run\` pour relancer l'application après avoir fait des modifications et que vous ouvrez simplement l'application depuis votre téléphone, vous n'obtiendrez pas les dernières modifications. C'est parce que vous ouvrez l'instance précédemment installée de l'application qui ne contient pas les modifications récentes. Pour que votre téléphone affiche la version la plus récente de l'application avec les modifications que vous avez apportées, suivez ces étapes: 1. Assurez-vous que Flutter est bien configuré et que votre environnement de développement (par exemple, Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.) est à jour. 2. Connectez votre téléphone à votre ordinateur avec un câble USB. 3. Ouvrez votre projet Flutter. 4. Exécutez \`flutter clean\` dans votre terminal pour supprimer les anciennes données de build. 5. Lancez la commande \`flutter run\` pour compiler l'application et l'installer sur votre appareil. Si vous ne voulez pas ou ne pouvez pas connecter votre téléphone à votre ordinateur à chaque fois que vous souhaitez tester une nouvelle version de votre application, vous pouvez : - Utiliser le hot reload ou hot restart pendant que votre téléphone est connecté pour voir immédiatement les effets de petites modifications dans le code. - Générer et installer un APK (ou un AppBundle pour une distribution via le Play Store) pour les tests en utilisant les commandes \`flutter build apk\` ou \`flutter build appbundle\`. Après le build, vous pouvez transférer le fichier APK ou AppBundle vers votre appareil et l'installer manuellement pour tester les modifications. Assurez-vous également que vous n'ayez pas activé de restrictions de développement sur votre téléphone qui pourraient empêcher la mise à jour de l'application. Si vous suivez ces étapes et que le problème persiste, il se peut que vous rencontriez un problème spécifique à votre configuration de développement ou à votre téléphone, et il faudrait alors examiner plus en détail les paramètres de votre environnement de développement et les logs ou messages d'erreur potentiels."},{"prompt":"reecris ce mail: Bonjour a tous, J'espere que vous allez bien.

Ecco alcuni passaggi che puoi seguire per cercare di risolvere il problema: 1. **Controllo Chiave/Fob**: - **Batteria del telecomando**: Se stai utilizzando un telecomando per aprire il bagagliaio e non funziona, potrebbe essere necessario sostituire la batteria. - **Funzione manuale**: Prova ad aprire il bagagliaio utilizzando la chiave fisica se ne hai una. 2. **Blocco centralizzato**: - Controlla se il blocco centralizzato funziona correttamente. A volte il problema del bagagliaio potrebbe essere correlato a un malfunzionamento del sistema di blocco centralizzato dell'auto. 3. **Interruttore/Maniglia di apertura**: - Assicurati che l'interruttore o la maniglia di apertura del bagagliaio non siano bloccati o danneggiati. A volte sporco o detriti possono impedire il corretto funzionamento. 4. **Fusibili**: - Controlla i fusibili dell'auto per assicurarti che non ne sia bruciato qualcuno che possa essere associato al meccanismo di sblocco del bagagliaio. 5. **Problemi meccanici**: - Il meccanismo di chiusura/sblocco potrebbe essere inceppato o danneggiato. Se sospetti che sia questo il problema, potrebbe essere necessario rimuovere il rivestimento interno del bagagliaio per accedere al meccanismo e verificarne l'operatività. 6. **Sicurezza bambini o blocco internazionale del bagagliaio**: - In alcune auto esiste una funzione di sicurezza che impedisce l'apertura del bagagliaio dall'interno. Controlla se la tua Clio ha questa funzione e assicurati che non sia attivata. Se non riesci a risolvere il problema con questi passaggi, potrebbe essere necessario portare la tua auto da un professionista per un controllo approfondito. Infatti, se il problema è relativo a un componente elettrico o meccanico più complesso, potrebbe essere necessario un intervento professionale per effettuare la riparazione."},{"prompt":"Non apre solo il bagagliaio neanche dall esterno mentre le porte le apre. Ha il key less ed ho cambiato la batteria del telecomando","completion":"Se il bagagliaio della tua Renault Clio IV con il sistema keyless (apertura senza chiave) non si apre, ma le porte si, ecco alcune possibili cause e soluzioni che puoi provare: 1. **Problema specifico al meccanismo del bagagliaio**: - Può darsi che ci sia un guasto specifico al meccanismo di apertura del bagagliaio, come un attuatore difettoso, un cablaggio danneggiato o un problema con il sistema di blocco. 2. **Sensore del bagagliaio**: - Verifica se c'è un pulsante o un sensore specifico per l'apertura del bagagliaio (può essere situato vicino alla targa o nella maniglia del bagagliaio). Assicurati che non ci siano detriti o sporco che potrebbero ostruirlo. 3. **Programmazione del sistema keyless**: - Il problema potrebbe essere legato al sistema keyless. Se hai recentemente cambiato la batteria del telecomando, potrebbe essere necessario riprogrammare il telecomando o resettare il sistema di riconoscimento. 4. **Disfunzione interna**: - Potrebbe esserci una disfunzione interna alla centralina che gestisce l'apertura keyless del bagagliaio. Questo potrebbe richiedere un intervento tecnico o l'uso di uno strumento diagnostico per resettare il sistema o aggiornare il software. 5. **Emergenza Manuale**: - La maggior parte dei veicoli è dotata di un sistema manuale di apertura di emergenza del bagagliaio. Di solito, è possibile accedere a una leva o un cordino nascosto all'interno dell'abitacolo o attraverso il portellone posteriore rimuovendo una parte del rivestimento interno. Controlla il manuale del proprietario per le istruzioni su come aprire manualmente il bagagliaio. 6. **Fusibile specifico**: - Se l'auto ha dei fusibili dedicati al sistema di apertura del bagagliaio, controlla che questi non siano bruciati e sostituiscili se necessario. 7. **Consultazione del manuale del proprietario**: - A volte, la soluzione potrebbe essere semplice come seguire una procedura particolare descritta nel manuale del veicolo. È consigliabile controllare il manuale per qualsiasi step specifico di risoluzione dei problemi relativo all'apertura del bagagliaio. Se dopo aver eseguito questi passaggi il problema persiste, è consigliabile rivolgersi a un concessionario o un meccanico professionista autorizzato dalla Renault che sarà in grado di diagnosticare il problema con precisione e fornirti un'assistenza adeguata."},{"prompt":"Se ti indico modello e anno puoi dirmi quali fusibili verificare?","completion":"Certo, se mi fornisci il modello esatto e l'anno della tua Renault Clio IV, posso cercare di aiutarti indicandoti quali fusibili controllare.

Tipicamente il manuale ha una sezione che mostra la mappa dei fusibili e fornisce dettagli su quale fusibile controlla quali funzioni. Generalmente, i fusibili si trovano in due postazioni nell’auto: - Nel cruscotto, sul lato del passeggero o del guidatore. Si accede spesso aprendo una porta sul lato del pannello. - Nel vano motore, dove si trova una scatola dei fusibili di solito vicino alla batteria o lungo il parafango. Fusibili da controllare potrebbero essere quelli dedicati ai sistemi di comfort, comandi elettrici o sistemi di chiusura centralizzati. Sarebbe utile cercare quelli relativi al comando della serratura del bagagliaio o al sistema di apertura keyless. Se non hai il manuale, a volte è possibile trovare le informazioni online o in forum di appassionati della Clio e di Renault. Inoltre, puoi considerare di contattare una concessionaria Renault per ottenere le informazioni specifiche sui fusibili. In ogni caso, se non ti senti a tuo agio nel controllare o nel sostituire i fusibili, o se non riesci a diagnosticare il problema, sarebbe meglio consultare un meccanico o un'officina autorizzata Renault. Inoltre, i problemi legati al sistema elettrico possono essere complicati e spesso richiedono conoscenze specifiche o strumenti diagnostici per essere risolti correttamente."},{"prompt":"please explain in detail what does \\"boom defense\\" mean? how is it best translated into russian? please also cite your sources","completion":"\\"Boom defense\\" or \\"boom defence\\" refers to a floating barrier used to protect a harbor, river, or coastal area against enemy ships and submarines. It is typically a chain of large, linked floats or buoises that can extend across the mouth of a harbor or river to prevent the passage of hostile watercraft while allowing friendly vessels to pass through controlled access points. Such barriers were especially common during World War II for the protection of naval assets. The boom defense is often complemented by other defensive measures such as mines, nets, or anti-submarine devices to create a more comprehensive defensive system. In Russian, \\"boom defense\\" could be translated as \\"бум барьер\\" or \\"заграждение бум\\". However, to ensure that the translation accurately conveys the military context, a more commonly used term might be preferable, such as \\"морской заграждение\\" (sea barrier) or \\"антиторпедное заграждение\\" (anti-torpedo barrier). Note that \\"бум\\" in Russian would not be the same as \\"boom\\" in the English naval/military term. A suitable term that would resonate with Russian speakers while conveying the military context might be \\"гидротехническое заграждение,\\" which encompasses hydraulic engineering structures used for similar defensive purposes. It is important to not only translate the word but also capture the cultural and functional nuances in translation to ensure that the intended meaning is maintained for Russian speakers with knowledge of maritime or military terminology. For sourcing on the concept of boom defense, you might refer to historical documents or naval warfare references, such as: - Playfair, Ian S.O., and Molony, C.J.C., et al. (2004). \\"The Mediterranean and Middle East: The Destruction of the Axis forces in Africa\\". History of the Second World War, United Kingdom Military Series. Naval & Military Press. ISBN 1-84574-068-8. - War Department Field Manual 55-105, \\"Seacoast Artillery: Service of the Piece—155-mm Gun (GPF),\\" United States War Department, February 1944. While these sources address broader topics, they provide insights into the military practices of the era, including the use of boom defenses. For the actual Russian terminology, reference might be made to Russian military historical documents or textbooks on naval warfare, which would require access to the appropriate Russian-language sources or defense manuals."},{"prompt":"isnt' боновые заграждения a better translation?","completion":"Yes, you are correct. \\"Боновые заграждения\\" is indeed a better and more accurate translation of \\"boom defense\\" into Russian. The word \\"бон\\" (bon) in Russian refers specifically to a type of naval barrier, capturing the concept of a boom that is used to block or defend a waterway against enemy vessels. The term is well-established in Russian military and naval terminology and aligns directly with the concept of a boom defense system. So the full term \\"боновые заграждения\\" would be directly understood by Russian speakers as referring to defensive marine booms, and it maintains the technical and military context of the original English term. My initial suggestions were broader and did not offer the specificity that \\"боновые заграждения\\" provides. Thank you for pointing out the more precise translation. It is always worthwhile to find the term that best captures the intended meaning in the context of the subject matter, especially when dealing with specific technical or military terms."},{"prompt":"Give me an A/B test of this text: Leading with a coaching and mentoring approach, I prioritise my team's personal and professional growth.

'Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A): Practices, Roles, Responsibilities, and Functions' Business partnering skills include the ability to work well with others and understand their business priorities and goals, build a deep knowledge of the company and its processes, and turn droves of information into easily understood reports. FP&A Responsibilities: #P&L: The FP&A team is responsible for putting together profit and loss (P&L) statements, board reports and management reports such as variance reports, which track budget vs. actual spend by department, and statements of cash flow. Finalizing these statements requires collecting data from different departments (thus the business partnering skills) and then verifying and consolidating that information. The FP&A team uses that to calculate key financial indicators that will appear in these statements—like debt-to-equity ratio and current ratio. #Profit Margins: FP&A professionals often dig into financial statements to understand which product lines or services have the highest profit margin or contribute the most to net profit. Similarly, they may break down the cost and revenue or profit generated by each department within the company. **Another common duty of FP&A team members is assessing a business's investments with its working capital and finding new investment** opportunities. #Budgeting: More forward-looking responsibilities of FP&A include planning the budget and forecasting the company's future financial performance. Budgeting requires parsing through financial reports to determine how to allocate money. Forecasting requires creating financial models that account for trends within the business and in the broader industry and economy that may affect revenue and profit. A smaller business may forecast 4-8 months out, while a larger enterprise could look 1-3 years into the future. Planning and forecasting are not just an annual or quarterly event—more businesses have shifted to continual planning and rolling forecasts, regularly evaluating the latest numbers to make adjustments. #Scenario Planning: One type of financial modeling is scenario planning, a process in which FP&A employees map out best-case, expected and worst-case scenarios by plugging in different numbers for sales and order volume to see how it would impact the company's financial position. Based on those results, the team can identify steps it would take in response to different outcomes, better preparing a business for the future—“extremely or very effective” FP&A teams were more likely to have predictive capabilities, according to a survey from AFP/APQC. These projections can also help plan capital expenses and other investments. #Ad-hoc reporting: These on-demand reports, typically requested by the CFO or controller, often provide a more detailed look at a certain KPI or business department. An analyst or director may need to pull numbers from various broader reports to uncover the specific information the executive wants. This reporting and modeling, especially if it's done frequently, gives the FP&A team the information it needs to provide timely, accurate and actionable recommendations to senior management. Building an Effective FP&A Team: Every business has an accountant, but many don't have someone dedicated to FP&A. FP&A team structure varies greatly—at a small company, this function could be just one aspect of one person's job, like the controller, while a larger organization might have dozens of FP&A employees. FP&A is typically a role an organization adds personnel to as it becomes more complex with multiple locations, subsidiaries, departments or international operations. That explains why some companies are just beginning to build up FP&A resources and headcount, while others have high-performing teams that regularly feed strategic reports to the C-suite. Three Roles of FP&A Teams: Although job titles and roles of FP&A team members will vary by company, here are common titles and their respective responsibilities: #Corporate Financial Analyst: - Analyze financial data and use financial models for forecasting. -Track revenue and gross margin by business unit and expenses by cost center. - Prepare reports on financial performance tailored to the needs of leadership. - Evaluate financial performance by comparing and analyzing actual results with plans and forecasts. - Study and analyze trends and forecasts to inform recommended actions. - Establish policies and procedures that guide cost analyses. #FP&A Manager - Work closely with the leadership team to formulate short- to long-term financial and strategic plans. - Analyze financial and operational results to better understand the company's overall financial health. -Evaluate previous budgets and collaborate with business unit leaders to build their annual budgets and forecasts. - Produce models to project long-term growth, accounting for factors that will impact performance. - Provide detailed analysis and commentary on the performance of a product or department. - Communicate results and recommendations to senior management that will lead to revenue generation, cost reduction and more efficient operations. #Director of FP&A/Vice President of FP&A - Own the process for preparing financial statements and financial models, including scenario planning. - Define processes for monthly, quarterly and annual financial budgeting, forecasting and long-range planning. -Drive and improve existing management reporting to be more accurate and timely. - Analyze financial results to determine key takeaways and recommendations for senior management. - Lead ad hoc financial modeling and reporting for special projects. Partner with IT and the broader organization to improve forecasting through automation and system optimization. Key FP&A Functions: #Short- and Long-term Planning: - Gather and compile data for P&L statements. - Consolidate plans from various departments and communicate finalized plan. - Perform scenario planning based on different assumptions. #Budgeting & Planning: - Create a 'fixed' budget for a specific period (typically one year). - Monitor the month-to-month execution of the plan, including revenue and expenses, expected cash flow and debt reduction. - \\"Adjust plan based on actual performance\\" and other developments. #Management Reporting: - Pull together monthly, quarterly and annual reports on budget vs. actual and cash flow. - Aggregate and analyze financial and operational data to glean insights that direct decision-making. - Present reports to executives and/or Board of Directors. #Forecasting: - Use historical data to forecast financial performance over the next 4-12 quarters. - Re-forecast the next 12 months at the end of each quarter for rolling forecast. #Ad-Hoc Reporting & Analysis: - Quickly gather data for ad-hoc analysis and reporting throughout the year. - Make recommendations to management based on findings.","completion":"#Step One: Identify the Overall Objective The overarching goal for the Corporate Financial Analyst, FP&A Manager, and Director of FP&A/Vice President of FP&A is to enable informed strategic decision-making by providing accurate and insightful financial information and forecasts.

Top-tier tech companies tend to exist in a state of continuous evolution and disruption, necessitating an FP&A practice that is exceptionally flexible, speed-oriented, and forward-looking. The FP&A Manager’s role is to enable the organization to navigate and capitalize on rapid market movements and technology trends. In contrast, at Pitney Bowes, the FP&A Manager would play a critical role in not only supporting the current business but also in strategically steering the company through a transformational phase, where stability, risk management, and careful planning are equally important. Thus, while both roles are ultimately aimed at driving financial health and strategic insight, the day-to-day focus and execution of tasks can differ markedly, based on the different dynamics and imperatives of the environment in which each company operates."},{"prompt":"Another try?

Here's an example: \`\`\`python from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView from flask_admin import expose, redirect class MyModelView(ModelView): @expose('/edit/', methods=('GET', 'POST')) def edit_view(self): if request.method == 'POST': return redirect(url_for('.view')) return super(MyModelView, self).edit_view() \`\`\` In the code above, we create a custom \`MyModelView\` class that inherits from \`ModelView\`. We then override the \`edit_view\` method. Inside this method, we check if the request method is POST. If it is, we redirect to a different view using \`redirect\` and \`url_for\` functions. This effectively prevents any POST requests to the \`/edit\` route. If the request method is GET, we call the parent class's \`edit_view\` method using \`super(MyModelView, self).edit_view()\` to access the default behavior of the \`edit_view\` in Flask-Admin. Using this approach, the user will be redirected from the edit view to a different view whenever they try to make any changes. This way, the editing functionality is effectively disabled."},{"prompt":"restrict permisson for crud operation in flask admin","completion":"To restrict permissions for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Flask-Admin, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions system provided by Flask-Admin itself. Flask-Admin allows you to define customized views with different permissions for each CRUD operation. Here's an example demonstrating how to restrict permissions for CRUD operations in Flask-Admin: \`\`\`python from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView from flask_admin import Admin from flask_security import current_user admin = Admin(app) class RestrictedModelView(ModelView): def is_accessible(self): # Check if the current user has the necessary role or permission to access the view return current_user.has_role('admin') # Replace 'admin' with the appropriate role or permission name def inaccessible_callback(self, name, **kwargs): # Redirect or raise an exception if the current user does not have access to the view return redirect(url_for('security.login')) # Replace 'security.login' with the appropriate login route # Register your models with restricted views admin.add_view(RestrictedModelView(Model1, db.session)) admin.add_view(RestrictedModelView(Model2, db.session)) \`\`\` In the above code, we define a \`RestrictedModelView\` class that inherits from \`ModelView\` provided by Flask-Admin. In this custom view, we override the \`is_accessible\` and \`inaccessible_callback\` methods. The \`is_accessible\` method checks whether the current user has the necessary role or permission to access the view. You can replace \`'admin'\` in the code with the appropriate role or permission name based on your application's permission system. The \`inaccessible_callback\` method is called when the current user does not have access to the view. In this example, we redirect the user to the login page by using \`redirect\` and \`url_for\` functions. You can replace \`'security.login'\` with the appropriate login route for your application. Finally, you can register your models with the restricted views using \`admin.add_view()\`. By implementing the \`is_accessible\` and \`inaccessible_callback\` methods in the custom view, you can control the permissions for CRUD operations in Flask-Admin based on your application's role or permission system."},{"prompt":"how to use def is_action_allowed(self, name) in flask admin","completion":"The \`is_action_allowed()\` method in Flask-Admin allows you to define custom logic to determine whether a specific action is allowed or not. This method takes the \`name\` parameter, which represents the name of the action being checked. Here's an example showing how to use the \`is_action_allowed()\` method in Flask-Admin: \`\`\`python from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView class CustomModelView(ModelView): def is_action_allowed(self, name): if name == 'edit' and not current_user.is_admin: return False if name == 'delete' and not current_user.is_superuser: return False return True \`\`\` In the above code snippet, we define a custom \`CustomModelView\` class that inherits from \`ModelView\`. Inside this class, we override the \`is_action_allowed()\` method. In our custom implementation, we check the value of the \`name\` parameter to determine which action is being checked. We can then apply custom logic based on the action being checked. In this example, we prevent non-admin users from being able to perform the \`edit\` action by returning \`False\` for that action if the \`current_user\` does not have the \`is_admin\` attribute set. Similarly, we restrict the \`delete\` action to only superusers, returning \`False\` for other users. For other actions or situations, we return \`True\` to allow the action. This way, you can customize the \`is_action_allowed()\` method in Flask-Admin to define granular permissions and control the availability of actions based on your application's logic and the current user's attributes or roles."},{"prompt":"why flask action doesn't work","completion":"If Flask actions are not working as expected, there can be several reasons for this issue. Here are some common mistakes or factors that could cause Flask actions to not work: 1. Incorrect route mapping: Make sure the route for the action is correctly defined and mapped in your Flask application. Ensure that you have specified the correct URL pattern and HTTP methods for the action route. 2. Incorrect view or method name: Verify that you are calling the correct method and referencing the correct view class for the action. If the method or view name is misspelled or does not match with the route configuration, the action won't be triggered. 3. Missing or incorrect decorators: Check if you have applied the necessary decorators, such as \`@app.route\` or \`@expose\`, to the action function or method. Decorators are essential for mapping the function or method to the correct URL route. 4. Missing or incorrect request type: Ensure that you are handling the correct request type (GET, POST, etc.) in your action view or method. If the action is expecting a POST request, for example, make sure you are triggering the action via a form submission with the correct method set. 5. Authentication or authorization issue: If your Flask application uses any authentication or authorization mechanism, ensure that the user performing the action has the necessary permissions to access and trigger the action. Check if the user has the correct roles, permissions, or CSRF protection configured, depending on your application's requirements. 6. Error or exception handling: Wrap your action code inside appropriate try-catch blocks to catch any potential exceptions that might be occurring and causing the action"},{"prompt":"Correct oracle select \`\`\`SELECT * FROM ( SELECT V_CM_UTRAN_CELL_V3.USERLABEL, V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.USERLABEL, SUM(V_PM2_KCELL_UTRAN_SHO_M.C310880137) AS Attempts FROM NAF_CM.V_CM_UTRAN_CELL_V3, NAF_CM.V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3, KCELL.V_PM2_KCELL_UTRAN_SHO_M WHERE V_PM2_KCELL_UTRAN_SHO_M.NE_ID = V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.NEID AND V_PM2_KCELL_UTRAN_SHO_M.RELATIONID = V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.AMCC || ':' || V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.AMNC || ':' || V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.NRNCID || ':' || V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.NCID AND BEGINTIME >= sysdate - 14 AND ROWNUM <= 300 GROUP BY V_CM_UTRAN_CELL_V3.USERLABEL, V_CM_UTRAN_RELATION_V3.USERLABEL ORDER BY V_CM_UTRAN_CELL_V3.USERLABEL) ORDER BY 3 DESC\`\`\`","completion":"The provided Oracle select statement is already correct.

Make sure you have a backup of your WordPress site before making any changes. 2. Verify that the file \\"class-wp-site-health.php\\" exists in the \\"wp-admin/includes\\" directory of your WordPress installation. If it's missing, you'll need to restore it from a backup or reinstall WordPress. 3. If the file exists, check the file permissions to ensure that it is readable by the web server. The file should have permissions set to 644 or similar. 4. Clear any caching plugins or services you may be using, as they may be serving an outdated version of the file. 5. Disable any recent plugins or themes you installed before the issue occurred to see if they are causing a conflict. You can do this by renaming the respective folders within the \\"wp-content/plugins\\" or \\"wp-content/themes\\" directory. 6. If the issue persists, try disabling all of your plugins and activating them one by one to identify the problematic plugin. You can do this by renaming the \\"plugins\\" directory to something else, which will deactivate all plugins at once. Then, rename it back to \\"plugins\\" and reactivate each plugin individually until the issue reoccurs. 7.
