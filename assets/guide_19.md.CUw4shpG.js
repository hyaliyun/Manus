Since ServiceNow doesn't offer direct settings for such UI behavior changes through system properties or configurations, you'll need to take a custom development approach. As mentioned in the previous response, the following steps present a workaround using a UI Script. This time, I will adjust the script to target both the select box and the link icon. # Step 1: Create or Modify a UI Script 1. **Navigate** to **System UI > UI Scripts** in the application navigator. 2. **Click** on **New** to create a new UI Script, or **edit** your existing script if you prefer. 3. Fill in the necessary fields: - **Name**: Enter a meaningful name, e.g., \`AlwaysShowCheckboxAndIcon\`. - **Global**: Choose \`Yes\` to have it applied throughout the instance or \`No\` for specific places. 4. In the **Script** field, input the JavaScript to alter both the checkbox and link icon visibility. For example: \`\`\`javascript addLoadEvent(function() { var css = \` /* Always show checkboxes */ tr.list_row>td>div.list_decoration_cell>span.input-group-checkbox>span.checkbox>label>i.checkbox-input-check, tr.list_row:hover>td>div.list_decoration_cell>span.input-group-checkbox>span.checkbox>label>i.checkbox-input-check { visibility: visible !important; } /* Always show link/icon */ tr.list_row>td.list_decoration_cell>span.list_decoration > span.icon, tr.list_row:hover>td.list_decoration_cell>span.list_decoration > span.icon { visibility: visible !important; display: inline-block !important; /* Adjust as needed */ }\`, head = document.head || document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0], style = document.createElement('style'); style.type = 'text/css'; style.appendChild(document.createTextNode(css)); head.appendChild(style); }); \`\`\` This code snippet specifically targets the CSS to adjust the visibility of these elements. The \`display: inline-block;\` part for the icon might need an adjustment based on your instance's specific icon setup. 5. **Save** the UI Script by clicking on the **Submit** button. # Step 2: Testing and Adjustment After saving the script: 1. **Clear your browser cache** or use an incognito session to ensure the new script loads. 2. **Navigate** to a list view where you expect to see the changes. The checkboxes and the icon should be permanently visible for each record. # Additional Considerations - **Instance Specificity**: Your ServiceNow instance might have custom styles or scripts that could interfere with this script. If the script doesn't work as expected, inspect the page to check for conflicting CSS or JavaScript. - **Performance Impact**: Additional scripts and style changes might have a minor impact on page load times or responsiveness. Always monitor the performance impact of custom scripts. - **Future Compatibility**: Any customization should be documented and tested against ServiceNow updates or upgrades to ensure continued functionality. If you're new to scripting or CSS, or if these changes impact your instance in unexpected ways, consider consulting a ServiceNow developer or administrator within your organization. Given the customized nature of ServiceNow instances, collaboration with your instance's administrators can help ensure that customizations like this do not interfere with other functionality."},{"prompt":"select box and preview icon was not displayed in front of incident record in list view. it was showing when cursor hover place above the incident record","completion":"For clarification, it seems there was some confusion in the initial request and my response. The behavior you're encountering—where the select box (checkbox) and preview (link icon) only appear when hovering over an incident record in a list view—is default behavior in ServiceNow to keep the UI clean and focused. However, as of the latest updates prior to my last knowledge update in 2023, ServiceNow does not provide an out-of-the-box configuration option to modify this behavior directly via UI settings or system properties. Achieving always-visible checkboxes and preview icons requires a custom client-side solution, which may include injecting custom CSS and/or JavaScript into the ServiceNow instance, as I previously described. Given this, and the provided custom script approach in my previous response, there are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. **Support and Upgrades**: Custom solutions may not be supported by ServiceNow, and there's a risk that they might break with future platform upgrades. Always test customizations thoroughly in a sub-production instance following every upgrade. 2. **Performance**: Injecting custom styles and scripts might slightly impact client-side performance, mainly if used extensively. Monitor the performance to ensure the user experience remains satisfactory. 3. **UI Script Adaptation**: The provided UI Script examples aim to override the default CSS to keep certain elements always visible. They do so by targeting the specific CSS classes associated with those UI elements (e.g., the checkboxes and icon links). However, the exact CSS selectors used in ServiceNow can change between versions, so the provided script may need adjustments. 4. **Browser Developer Tools**: To precisely target the elements and test changes live, you can use browser developer tools (often accessible via F12 or right-click → Inspect). This is a great way to experiment with CSS changes before implementing them in a UI Script. 5. **Alternative Approaches**: Since customizing the UI this way might not be ideal or sustainable in the long term, consider if there are alternative approaches to achieving your underlying goals. For instance, evaluating why you need these elements always visible may reveal different UI adjustments or process improvements that could be more effective or more straightforward to implement. Given the complexities and risks associated with custom UI modifications in ServiceNow, especially for functionality tied closely to the default user experience, engaging with ServiceNow's community or even official support may provide newer, perhaps more supported ways of achieving your goals. Additionally, staying engaged with the ServiceNow developer community, through forums or the official ServiceNow Developer Program, can offer insights into best practices and innovative solutions from other customers and partners facing similar challenges."},{"prompt":"Achieving always-visible checkboxes and preview icons before the incident records in list view","completion":"Achieving always-visible checkboxes and preview icons before the incident records in a ServiceNow list view typically requires custom client-side code, due to the nature of how ServiceNow dynamically generates and styles its list views. It is essential to note that any custom solution like this might not be officially supported by ServiceNow, and there is always a risk it could break with future updates or upgrades to the platform. Therefore, it's crucial to thoroughly test any customization in a development environment before considering a move to production. Below is an example strategy using custom CSS injected through a UI Script. However, due to the dynamic nature of ServiceNow updates and customizations, you might need to adjust the CSS selectors based on your instance and version. This example assumes the goal is to modify the CSS so that checkboxes and preview icons are always visible instead of only on hover. # Step 1: Create a UI Script 1. **Navigate to System Definition > UI Scripts.** 2. Click **New** to create a new UI Script and configure it as follows: - Name: \`AlwaysVisibleCheckboxesAndIcons\` - Description: _(Optional but recommended)_ - Global: Yes (to apply this change across all list views; select No if you plan to include this script explicitly in tailored pages or spaces). 3. In the Script field, insert the following JavaScript that injects custom CSS: \`\`\`javascript addGlobalStyle('.list_decoration_cell .input-group-checkbox, .list_decoration_cell .icon-light { visibility: visible !important; opacity: 1 !important; }'); function addGlobalStyle(css) { var head, style; head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; if (!head) { return; } style = document.createElement('style'); style.type = 'text/css'; style.innerHTML = css; head.appendChild(style); } \`\`\` This code snippet specifically targets the usual classes for checkboxes (\`.input-group-checkbox\`) and icons (\`.icon-light\`) in list view decoration cells (\`list_decoration_cell\`) to make them always visible with full opacity. 4. **Submit** to save your UI Script. # Step 2: Evaluate Impact and Adjust as Required After implementing, visible changes should take effect across list views. However, since ServiceNow could update class names or implement other changes in future versions, it’s important to: - **Review and Adapt**: Regularly review this customization against ServiceNow updates or upgrades. - **Check Performance**: Ensure that this customization, especially being applied globally, does not significantly impact client-side performance. - **User Feedback**: Gather feedback from users. In some cases, always-visible elements can clutter the UI and potentially hamper usability, so it’s important to balance customizations with user experience. # Step 3: Monitor and Update With the customization in place, monitor its impact on the user experience and system performance. Be prepared to revisit and adjust the script as ServiceNow evolves. **Important Considerations:** - **Future Compatibility & Support**: Customizations like this might not be supported by ServiceNow, and future platform updates can affect their continuity. It's advisable to document such customizations comprehensively and review them as part of the preparation for ServiceNow upgrades. - **Testing**: Extensively test this change in a sub-production instance before considering deployment to production. Lastly, always consider reaching out to the ServiceNow community or engaging a ServiceNow partner for complex customizations or to explore if newer, out-of-the-box options might align with your objectives, ensuring you're following best practices and maintaining supportability and upgradeability of your ServiceNow instance."},{"prompt":"not working","completion":"If the approach described earlier to make checkboxes and preview icons always visible in a ServiceNow list view didn't work, there could be several reasons why that might be happening. It could be due to changes in ServiceNow platform updates, variations in instances, or differences in UI elements' class names based on the version or customizations present in your instance. Given this, let’s explore an alternative approach using a more general method that focuses on troubleshooting and identifying the correct CSS selectors. This method involves using your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and adjust the script accordingly. # Step-by-Step Guide to Troubleshoot and Adjust Step 1: Identify Correct CSS Selectors 1. **Open your ServiceNow instance** and navigate to the list view where you want checkboxes and the preview icons to always be visible. 2. **Right-click** on the checkbox or preview icon (visible on hover) and select **Inspect** or **Inspect Element**, depending on your browser. This opens the browser's developer tools. 3. **Locate** the HTML element for the checkbox or icon in the elements panel of developer tools. You might need to hover over various parts of the HTML in the developer tools to find the precise element. 4. **Note down** the CSS classes or IDs that uniquely identify these elements. ServiceNow often uses generic classes, but there might be a pattern you can target that applies specifically to list view items. Step 2: Formulate Correct CSS Based on the elements' identifiers you found, formulate CSS rules that target these elements to make them always visible. For example, assuming you found elements with classes \`.checkbox\` and \`.list-icon\` that are made visible on hover, your CSS might look something like this: \`\`\`css .checkbox, .list-icon { visibility: visible !important; /* Ensure they are always visible */ opacity: 1 !important; /* Ensure they are not transparent */ } \`\`\` Step 3: Test CSS in Browser Before integrating this into ServiceNow through a UI Script, test your CSS directly in the browser: 1. **Open the browser's developer tools** on the ServiceNow list view page. 2. Locate the **\`<style>\`** tag within the **\`<head>\`** section or create one if necessary. 3. **Insert your CSS rules** and observe if the checkboxes and icons become permanently visible. Step 4: Integrate Into ServiceNow Once you've confirmed the CSS works as intended: 1. **Create or adjust a UI Script** in ServiceNow with your CSS. This process was described in the previous messages but adapt the CSS part with your newly formed rules. \`\`\`javascript addGlobalStyle('.checkbox, .list-icon { visibility: visible !important; opacity: 1 !important; }'); function addGlobalStyle(css) { var head, style; head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; if (!head) { return; } style = document.createElement('style'); style.type = 'text/css'; style.innerHTML = css; head.appendChild(style); } \`\`\` 2. Replace \`.checkbox, .list-icon\` with the actual selectors that you identified. Troubleshooting Tips - **Selectors not working?** Ensure you're using the correct and most specific CSS selectors. ServiceNow's dynamic UI may require more specific selectors to override existing styles. - **CSS not applying?** Clear your browser cache or try in incognito mode. Sometimes cached styles/scripts prevent new changes from taking effect. - **Impact on performance or user experience?** Always weigh the benefits of such UI customizations against potential downsides like increased page loading times or cluttered UI. If despite these steps, you're still facing issues, it might be a good moment to review the necessity of having these UI elements always visible or to reach out to ServiceNow support for advice, especially if this functionality is critical for your operations."},{"prompt":"my simple question is, i want to see the select box to select the incident records in list view always, not when i place cursor on it,","completion":"I understand that you need a simpler and more direct solution to your original question about making the select boxes (checkboxes) always visible for incident records in a ServiceNow list view, without requiring the cursor to hover over the records. The most straightforward and effective way to accomplish this involves using custom CSS. Since direct modification to ServiceNow's core CSS files or functionalities isn't advisable or sometimes not possible, employing a UI Script to inject custom CSS can help achieve this outcome. Given the complexity and the direct control needed, here is a distilled approach that aims to address this specific need effectively: # Step 1: Confirm the CSS Selectors First, you'll need to confirm the CSS selectors for the checkboxes in your ServiceNow instance's version, as these can slightly vary. Usually, the checkbox in a list view is wrapped within elements styled with specific classes utilized by ServiceNow for these components. The earlier provided CSS and JavaScript assume typical scenarios, but it's crucial first to inspect the element in your instance to confirm. # Step 2: Create a UI Script Let's proceed with a UI Script approach to inject custom CSS across your instance to ensure these checkboxes are always visible: 1. Navigate to **System UI > UI Scripts** in the application navigator. 2. Click **New** to create a new UI Script. 3. Configure the script as follows: - **Name**: \`MakeCheckboxesAlwaysVisible\` - **Global**: Yes (This will apply the script across your entire instance. Select \\"No\\" if you have a specific scope in mind.) 4. In the Script field, insert a JavaScript snippet similar to the following, adapted to inject the right CSS for your checkboxes: \`\`\`javascript document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { var style = document.createElement('style'); style.innerHTML = \` /* Target the checkboxes within list view rows */ tr.list_row td.list_decoration_cell .input-group-checkbox, tr.list_row td.list_decoration_cell .checkbox-label { visibility: visible !important; opacity: 1 !important; /* Ensure they're not transparent */ } \`; document.head.appendChild(style); }); \`\`\` 5. **Save** the UI Script. # Note: - This script is a general approach and may need adjustments based on the specific class names used within your ServiceNow instance's list views. Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible with F12 or right-click > Inspect) to inspect the checkbox elements and adjust the CSS selectors in the script accordingly. - The effects should be visible across all list views due to the global setting. If you encounter any pages where the script does not apply, ensure there aren't any conflicting CSS rules or scripts. - Adjustments might be necessary if your ServiceNow instance undergoes significant updates or if the underlying HTML structure of the list views changes in future releases. This solution aims to provide a practical and less intrusive method of making checkboxes always visible in list views, improving the user interaction within your instance by reducing the need for hover actions to reveal essential UI elements like selection checkboxes."},{"prompt":"not working","completion":"If the solution provided isn't working for your ServiceNow instance, it could be due to a variety of reasons such as version differences, custom themes, or other custom scripts that may be overriding or conflicting with the intended changes. Given this, let's try a more systematic approach to troubleshoot and potentially solve the issue of making select boxes (checkboxes) always visible in list views without requiring a hover. # Understanding the Situation The core challenge here is the dynamic nature of ServiceNow's front end. ServiceNow periodically updates their platform, which can include changes to the HTML structure, CSS classes, and JavaScript behavior. This means solutions may need to be adjusted based on the specific version and configuration of your instance. # Alternative Approach: Client Script If direct CSS injection via UI Scripts isn't yielding results, another path we can explore is using a **Client Script** that runs when the list view is loaded. This approach can ensure that your custom script runs in the context of the list views specifically. **However, it's crucial to note:** ServiceNow's best practices advise against extensive manipulation of the DOM (Document Object Model), as it can lead to maintenance challenges and potentially break during platform upgrades. # Steps to Create a Client Script for List Views: 1. Inspect Your List View - Navigate to the list view where you want the checkboxes always visible. - Use the browser's development tools (F12) to inspect the checkbox element and take note of its CSS classes. ServiceNow typically uses generic classes, but identifying the specific class or element structure for the checkbox can guide your script. 2. Attempt a Simple Client Script (for demonstration): - Navigate to **System Definition > Client Scripts**. - Click **New** to create a new Client Script. - Set the name and target the table that represents your list view, e.g., Incident. - Choose **List** as the script type to specifically target list views. - Consider a script along these lines, substituting \`.list_decoration_cell\` and \`.input-group-checkbox\` with the specific selectors you identified: \`\`\`javascript document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => { const style = document.createElement('style'); document.head.appendChild(style); style.innerHTML = \` /* Use the correct selector based on your inspection */ tr.list_row > td.list_decoration_cell .input-group-checkbox { visibility: visible !important; opacity: 1 !important; } \`; }); \`\`\` This script dynamically injects CSS into the page when it loads, specifically targeting list views due to the script being marked as \\"List\\". Important Considerations: - **Specificity and Scoping:** Ensure your Client Script is scoped appropriately to affect only the intended views or tables. - **Testing:** Thoroughly test in a non-production environment first. Check various list views and browsers to ensure compatibility and performance are acceptable. - **ServiceNow Version:** Be mindful that platform updates can affect the viability and functionality of these custom scripts. Regularly review and adjust after upgrades. If All Else Fails: Given the complexity of ServiceNow's platform and the variability between instances, if these solutions fail to work, consider reaching out to ServiceNow support or consulting the ServiceNow Community for advice. There might be instance-specific configurations, scripts, or stylesheets interfering with your efforts. Additionally, engaging with a ServiceNow partner or consultant who can review your instance directly might provide new insights or approaches. In complex platforms like ServiceNow, sometimes the direct solution can be elusive due to the layers of customizations and configurations that differ from one instance to another."},{"prompt":"Currently, I want resizable of new window popup when I click icon Lookup in reference field. I want window popup will be display fullscreen","completion":"Adjusting the behavior of the Lookup icon (magnifying glass) in reference fields to make the popup window display fullscreen, or to customize its size more generally, is a bit more involved and requires customizing the underlying JavaScript that controls these popups. ServiceNow doesn't provide a direct property or configuration for resizing these popup windows out of the box due to the varying needs across different implementations. However, you can achieve your goal by using a custom UI Script or tweaking the system's behavior through a carefully crafted Client Script or Business Rule, depending on where and how you want the adjustment to apply. # Approach with Caution Modifying the behavior of popups can affect the user experience across the entire platform. It's crucial to carefully consider the impact of such changes and thoroughly test them in a sub-production environment. # Custom UI Script One approach to modify the popup window size is to intercept the event that opens the popup window and then customize its parameters. Since the action of opening a popup window for reference fields is controlled by JavaScript, you'd need to identify the correct function to override. A starting point would be identifying and overriding the \`openPopup\` or similar functions within ServiceNow. However, customizing these core functions comes with risks, including potential impact on future upgrades and maintenance challenges. # Example of a Conceptual Approach Below is a **conceptual** example of how you might approach this. This is not ready-to-use code but rather an illustration meant to guide you towards a potential solution: 1. **Create a UI Script** in ServiceNow with a global scope so it applies everywhere necessary. 2. In the script, you might attempt to override the default popup function (note: actual function names and implementation could be significantly different and may vary by ServiceNow version): \`\`\`javascript if (window) { window.originalOpenPopupFunction = window.open; // Back up the original function window.open = function(url, name, features, replace) { // Check if the popup is a reference field lookup if (name && name.startsWith('lookup')) { // Modify features to make the popup fullscreen or as you wish features = 'width=' + screen.width + ',height=' + screen.height; } // Call the original function with possibly modified features return window.originalOpenPopupFunction(url, name, features, replace); } } \`\`\` 3. **Save** and thoroughly **test** the UI Script to ensure it behaves as expected without unintended side effects. # Important Considerations: - **Specific Implementation May Vary**: Since ServiceNow's internal API and function names might change over updates, this approach requires careful testing with each new ServiceNow version. - **Potential Impact**: Overriding global functions like \`window.open\` can have broad impacts. Ensure this script only runs where absolutely necessary and doesn't unintentionally affect other functionalities. - **Check ServiceNow Documentation and Community**: ServiceNow updates its platform regularly and introduces new features and best practices. It's good to check the latest documentation or ask in the ServiceNow community for any new, supported way to achieve your goal. Given these considerations, while it's technically feasible to customize popup window sizes, it's crucial to proceed with caution and fully understand the potential implications of such customizations on the user experience and platform maintainability. If you're unsure, consider reaching out for professional assistance or consulting ServiceNow's support or community forums for advice."},{"prompt":"in incident form , we have caller reference field and i need when i click on preview icon then group tab of user form also seen in preview tab","completion":"To achieve the specific behavior where clicking the preview icon next to a reference field (e.g., the \\"Caller\\" field on an Incident form) also displays a particular tab (e.g., the \\"Group\\" tab) within the previewed record, you need to understand that ServiceNow's out-of-the-box functionality for form previews might not directly support this level of customization without some workarounds or custom development. The preview window is essentially a modal that shows a condensed view of the record, and manipulating which tabs or sections are displayed within it isn't a standard configurable option through the UI or system properties. However, I'll outline an approach that might work depending on your requirements and technical constraints. This involves custom scripting and should be thoroughly tested. # Customizing the Preview Functionality 1. **Client Script Modification**: - One approach to alter the behavior of the preview popup would involve custom client scripts. You could attempt to intercept the click event on the preview icon and then programmatically navigate to or open the desired tab in the user form. However, this is complex because the preview functionality and form layout rendering are handled by ServiceNow's internal mechanisms. 2. **UI Macro or UI Page**: - Another, more viable option might involve creating a custom UI Macro or UI Page that replicates the preview functionality but is customized to your needs. This custom page could be coded to always display the \\"Group\\" tab for user records. - You would then need to replace the default preview icon action with a custom script that opens this UI Page or UI Macro as a modal window instead of the out-of-the-box preview. Here's a very high-level approach to the second option: **Creating a Custom UI Page:** - Navigate to **System UI > UI Pages** and create a new UI Page. - In this custom page, embed a form or details view of the user record ensuring that the \\"Group\\" tab is prominently displayed or set as the default tab. **Customizing the Caller Reference Field Icon Action:** - You may need to replace the default preview icon for the \\"Caller\\" field with a custom icon that triggers your UI Page as a modal popup. - This involves custom JavaScript to catch the icon's click event and redirect it. An example might be: \`\`\`javascript // This is pseudocode and needs adaptation document.getElementById('your_custom_preview_icon_id').addEventListener('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); // Code to open your UI Page as a modal popup }); \`\`\` - Remember, replacing standard functionality with custom implementations can introduce maintenance overhead and complexities. Always thoroughly test these customizations in a sub-production environment. # Important Considerations: - **Version Compatibility**: Ensure your customizations are compatible with your ServiceNow version and any potential future upgrades. - **Performance Impact**: Test the performance impact of your changes, especially if the custom UI Page or Macro is complex. - **Support and Maintenance**: Custom approaches require a good understanding of ServiceNow development practices and may be more challenging to maintain over time, especially through platform upgrades. Due to the complexities involved, consider reaching out to ServiceNow professionals or the ServiceNow Community for further assistance, especially if your organization has unique configurations or there are specific constraints you need to work within."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given the volume of data that companies like Uber generate—location data, trip times, distances, fares, etc.—MapReduce is a suitable framework for performing large-scale analysis efficiently. Here’s an overview of how you might approach this using the MapReduce programming model: # 1. Understanding the Data First, you need to understand the structure of the Uber dataset you're working with. An Uber dataset might include the following information: - Date/Time of trip - Start location (latitude, longitude) - End location (latitude, longitude) - Duration - Distance - Fare - Driver and rider IDs # 2. Defining the Problem Determine what you want to analyze. For example: - Average trip time or distance per region - Peak times for Uber rides in a specific area - Hotspots for pickups or dropoffs - Driver earnings analysis # 3. MapReduce Basics MapReduce works in two key phases: the Map phase and the Reduce phase, with an optional Combine phase for optimization. Map Phase In the Map phase, the dataset is split into smaller chunks, which are then processed by different mapper tasks in parallel. Each mapper processes a chunk of data and produces key-value pairs as output. **For Uber Data Analysis:** Each mapper could analyze a set of rides, extracting information like trip duration, start and end locations, or earnings, and output key-value pairs where the key could be a specific hour of the day, a geographical region, or a driver ID, and the value could be the trip duration, fare, or a counter (for counting trips). Combine Phase (Optional) Before sending data to the reducers, a \\"combine\\" function (running on the same nodes as the mappers) can be used to perform a local reduction of the mapper outputs to minimize network congestion. Reduce Phase In the Reduce phase, all the values for each unique key from the Map phase are aggregated. The reducer functions collect values by key and then execute a reduction task (such as summing, averaging, or finding the maximum value) on those values. **For Uber Data Analysis:** If analyzing peak times, the reducer might sum up all the trip counts per hour or region to identify peak times. For an earnings analysis, it could sum up all fares per driver to compute total earnings. # 4. Running the Job To run a MapReduce job, you typically need a cluster of machines. This could be a Hadoop cluster if you're using the Hadoop ecosystem for MapReduce, or any other distributed computing cluster setup that supports MapReduce tasks. # 5. Analyzing the Results After the MapReduce job completes, you'll have an output dataset with aggregated information according to your analysis goals. This dataset can then be further analyzed, visualized, or used as input for more complex analytical models. # Final Notes While this is a conceptual overview, actual implementation would require programming the mapper and reducer functions, possibly using languages like Java (for Hadoop), or Python (with MRJob or other libraries). Remember, the efficiency of MapReduce jobs depends significantly on how well the mapper and reducer functions are written and the underlying infrastructure."},{"prompt":"Uber Data Ananlysis with the help of mapreduce!

The job was executed with the \`Uber2\` class from your Uber.jar file on the Hadoop version 2.6.0. Here's a breakdown of the process and its outcomes based on your output: # Process: 1. **Job Execution Command**: - \`hadoop jar '/home/diwakar/Desktop/Hadoop/final-jarfiles/Uber.jar' Uber2 /Projects/uber /op4\` - This command triggers a MapReduce job using the \`Uber2\` class to process data in \`/Projects/uber\` and output results to \`/op4\`. 2. **Initial Warnings and Info**: - Some warnings about native Hadoop libraries and deprecated options are displayed. These warnings are common and often do not affect the execution of your MapReduce job. 3. **MapReduce Job Insight**: - Your MapReduce job starts by configuring splits and submitting tokens. It then processes 1 input split, which triggers one map task. 4. **Mapper Execution**: - Processing starts on the input split with some internal configurations related to map output collection and sorting. The map task processes 354 input records and also outputs 354 records, indicating that each input record resulted in an output record, likely with some transformation or filtering applied. 5. **Combining and Reducing**: - After mapping, there's a combine phase (not explicitly mentioned in the output but indicated by the counters) where the combine input records match the map output records, suggesting a pre-reduce operation that consolidated 354 records into 42. - The reduce phase processes these 42 combined records without further reducing the number of output records, resulting in 42 final output records written to HDFS. # Outcomes: - **Performance Metrics**: - The job completed successfully with no failed shuffles or tasks, indicating a smooth execution. - Performance counters like CPU time spent (0ms) and GC time (95ms) suggest a very quick job, but note that CPU time spent being 0 might be an artifact of running in a local or pseudo-distributed mode. - The job utilized a significant amount of heap space (over 865MB), despite the input data and the final output being relatively small. - **Data Analysis**: - It's not clear what specific analysis was performed (e.g., counting trips, analyzing trip durations) from the given output, but the job seems designed to aggregate data from 354 input records into 42 distinct groups. This could indicate analysis like summarizing activities by day, driver, or region. - **Final Data Output**: - The final output size is 688 bytes, written to HDFS in the \`/op4\` directory. Given the small size, the output is likely a compact aggregation or summary of the input data rather than detailed records. # Next Steps: - To understand the specifics of the analysis performed (like what the 42 output records represent), you'd need to look at the \`Uber2\` class's code in the jar file. - For further analysis or visualization, you might consider transferring the output data from HDFS to a local filesystem or a database. - If the analysis needs refining or extending (like analyzing different aspects of the Uber data), adjustments to the MapReduce job code in the \`Uber2\` class will be necessary. This exercise demonstrates the fundamental process of running a MapReduce job on Hadoop for data analysis, where data is processed in parallel through mapping and reducing phases to produce meaningful aggregations or summaries from large datasets."},{"prompt":"we will be performing analysis on the Uber dataset in Hadoop using MapReduce in Java.

First, we will parse the date, which is in string format into date format using SimpleDateFormat class in Java. Now, to take out the day of the date, we will use the getDay() which will return an integer value with the day of the week’s number.

Let's provide a concise summary and explanation for both: # Problem Statement 1: **Objective:** To find the days on which each dispatching base (referred to as basement in your code) has the highest number of trips. **Implementation:** - **Mapper:** Parses each line of the dataset to extract the dispatching base number, date, and number of trips. It then formats the date to find the day of the week and emits a key-value pair where the key is the combination of the dispatching base number and the day of the week, and the value is the number of trips. - **Reducer:** Sums up all the trips for each key (i.e., each dispatching base and day of the week combination) and emits the total number of trips for that key. # Problem Statement 2: **Objective:** To find the days on which each dispatching base has the highest number of active vehicles. **Implementation:** - **Mapper:** Similar to Problem Statement 1, but instead of the number of trips, it focuses on the active vehicles' counts. - **Reducer:** Functions identically to the reducer in Problem Statement 1, summing up all the active vehicles for each key and emitting the total. For both problem statements, the \`TokenizerMapper\` and \`IntSumReducer\` classes are suitably designed for the task. You parse the input data to understand the distribution of trips and active vehicles across different days of the week for each dispatching base, which could be valuable for operational insights and resource allocation for Uber. One area to note is error handling; while you catch a \`ParseException\`, you only print the stack trace. In a production scenario, you might want to have more robust error handling or logging to ensure data quality and reliability. Another aspect worth mentioning is the use of the \`Combiner\` class. In your code, you're using the reducer class as a combiner as well, which is great for this specific case since the operation (summation) is commutative and associative, enabling you to optimize the MapReduce process by doing partial aggregation at the Mapper nodes. Finally, running these programs requires compiling the Java code into a JAR file and then using the \`hadoop jar\` command to execute the job on a Hadoop cluster, specifying the input dataset location and the output directory for results, as shown in your example commands. By analyzing the output, stakeholders can gain useful insights into the operational dynamics of Uber bases, such as identifying peak operational days for targeted strategies on resource distribution and operational planning."},{"prompt":"ANSWER HER I did the ABOVE JAVA AS PART OF MY UNDERGRAD ACADEMIC PROJECT: Walmart Phone Inbox Shawna Lawson-Flintroy Mon, Apr 8, 4:52 PM (7 hours ago) to me Hi Rahul, I hope all is well.

However, its impact largely depends on several factors: 1. **Build-up and Foreshadowing**: The initial perception of the protagonist as the good guy needs to be convincingly established. Subsequent hints or moments that suggest they might have a darker side or be the antagonist should be carefully placed to create doubt without giving away the final twist. Proper foreshadowing makes the revelation feel earned rather than a cheap shock. 2. **Character Development**: For such a twist to be compelling, the protagonist's character development throughout the story is crucial. The revelation that they were perceived as the bad guy should challenge not only the player's perception but also the protagonist's understanding of themselves, leading to meaningful character growth. 3. **Narrative Context**: The twist's impact is heavily reliant on the context of the narrative and the game's world. It should align with the story's themes and the wider world's moral ambiguities. If the game has explored themes of perception versus reality, identity, and morality, the twist can serve as a powerful culmination of these themes. 4. **Player Agency and Involvement**: In a game, how the twist affects the player's perception of their actions can profoundly influence its effectiveness. If the player feels deceived in a way that negates their experiences or choices throughout the game, the twist may come off as frustrating. However, if the twist reframes the player’s actions in a meaningful way that adds depth to their experience, it can be highly effective. 5. **Execution of the Reveal**: The manner in which both twists are revealed (first as the bad guy, then as the good guy) should be dramatic and engaging, providing a mix of surprise, enlightenment, and stimulation to explore the narrative further or reconsider past events in the game. This approach, reminiscent of complex storytelling seen in games like \\"Spec Ops: The Line\\" or the nuanced narratives in \\"BioShock\\" series, requires careful planning and execution to prevent it from feeling like a gimmick. When done rightly, it can lead to a memorable and thought-provoking experience, encouraging players not only to rethink everything they thought they knew about the protagonist but also to reflect on themes such as morality, identity, and redemption in more nuanced ways."},{"prompt":"how powerful would the good guy all along twist be?","completion":"The power of the \\"good guy all along\\" twist in a narrative hinges on several critical elements such as context, execution, emotional investment, and the themes of the narrative. When skillfully executed, this twist can have a profound impact on both the story and the audience by challenging their perceptions and invoking a strong emotional response. Here are some aspects that determine its effectiveness: # Context and Narrative Build-up - **Surprise vs. Predictability**: A twist that genuinely surprises the audience while still making sense within the story's established context and clues is more impactful than one that feels predictable or unearned. - **Foreshadowing**: Proper foreshadowing that, in hindsight, makes the twist seem inevitable can significantly enhance the power of the revelation, adding depth to earlier parts of the narrative. # Emotional Investment - **Character Development**: The more the audience cares about the protagonist and their journey, the more powerful the twist. Emotional investment is key; if the audience feels a strong connection to the character, the reveal will elicit a stronger emotional response. - **Moral and Ethical Implications**: The twist's impact is magnified if it challenges the audience's moral and ethical beliefs, forcing them to reevaluate their own judgments and prejudices. # Execution of the Reveal - **Pacing and Timing**: The timing of the reveal is crucial. It should come at a moment when its impact will be maximum, neither too early to avoid proper buildup nor too late to prevent it from feeling like an afterthought. - **Clarity and Cohesion**: The reveal should be clear and cohesive, providing satisfying answers to previously raised questions while opening up new avenues of thought. # Post-Twist Narrative - **Impact on the Narrative**: The twist should have a significant impact on the narrative, altering the audience's perception of events and characters and adding layers to the story's themes and messages. - **Character Reactions and Growth**: How characters, especially the protagonist, react to and grow from this revelation can significantly enhance its power. The twist should serve as a catalyst for character development and plot progression. # Themes and Messages - **Exploration of Themes**: A powerful twist often explores complex themes such as identity, morality, redemption, and the nature of good and evil. How well these themes are interwoven into the narrative before and after the twist can greatly affect its impact. # Audience Response - **Reflection and Discussion**: The best twists provoke thought and discussion, encouraging the audience to reflect on the story's themes and the implications of the twist long after the narrative concludes. When these elements are carefully managed, the \\"good guy all along\\" twist can be incredibly powerful, leaving a lasting impression on the audience and elevating the narrative. Its success lies not just in the surprise it offers but in its ability to reshape the audience's understanding of the story and characters, adding depth and complexity to the narrative experience."},{"prompt":"what is analog signal and digital signal?","completion":"An analog signal and a digital signal are two fundamental types of signals used in electronics and communication to convey information. Both serve the same purpose but do so in fundamentally different ways, making them suitable for different applications. # Analog Signal An analog signal is a continuous signal that represents physical measurements. Analog signals are used in many systems, notably in signal processing and communication, to represent real-world phenomena, such as sound, light, temperature, and pressure, which naturally vary over time. In an analog signal, the information is translated into electric pulses of varying amplitude. For example, in analog audio recording, the variations in air pressure that constitute sound waves are converted into analogous electrical signals, with their continuous fluctuations in amplitude and frequency reflecting the sounds being captured or played. # Digital Signal A digital signal, on the other hand, represents data as sequences of discrete values. Instead of varying smoothly like analog signals, digital signals switch between a set of fixed values, typically two - representing binary 0s and 1s. This binary representation is what enables digital devices like computers, digital phones, and other digital electronics to process, store, and transmit data. Digital signals are considered more robust against noise and interference compared to analog signals because the data they carry can be easily restored, corrected, and replicated without degradation. # Key Differences 1. **Representation:** Analog signals are continuous, representing fluctuations directly analogous to the original signal. Digital signals are discrete, representing information through sequences of binary numbers. 2. **Noise Resistance:** Digital signals are more resistant to noise and interference than analog signals. This is because it is easier to differentiate between the two binary states (0 and 1) than to accurately measure the exact value of an analog signal amidst noise. 3. **Hardware:** Analog signals can be processed directly in their original form, often requiring analog circuitry. Digital signals require digital circuits, including microprocessors and microcontrollers, for processing. 4. **Applications:** Analog signals are often used in audio and video broadcasting and in older types of communication devices. Digital signals are used in most modern telecommunications, computing, and digital electronics due to their efficiency and ability to carry large amounts of data reliably. # Transition from Analog to Digital Many systems that originally utilized analog signals have transitioned to digital signals. This shift is primarily due to the advancements in digital technology that offer greater efficiency, higher quality, and increased capacity for data manipulation and storage. Examples include telephony, television broadcasting, and audio recording industries. However, analog signals are still important in various applications, especially where direct representation of continuously varying quantities is needed."},{"prompt":"what is capacitor?","completion":"A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in an electric field, used in various electrical and electronic circuits for multiple purposes. It consists of two conductors, known as plates, separated by an insulating material called the dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, an electric field is developed across the dielectric, causing a temporary storage of charge. This stored charge can then be released to the circuit when needed. Capacitors have a wide array of applications due to their ability to store and release energy rapidly. Some of their key uses include: 1. **Energy Storage:** Capacitors can store energy to be released upon demand, making them useful for power supply applications where temporary power boosts are needed. 2. **Filtering:** In power supplies and audio circuits, capacitors are used to smooth out fluctuations in voltage, filtering out noise and providing a cleaner signal. 3. **Signal Processing:** In communication systems, capacitors, in combination with other components, can differentiate between high-frequency and low-frequency signals, making them essential in filters, oscillators, and tuners. 4. **Power Factor Correction:** In industrial settings, capacitors are used to improve the power factor of electrical systems, reducing energy loss and improving the efficiency of power distribution. 5. **Timing and Delay:** Capacitors can create time delays in circuits, as the time it takes for a capacitor to charge or discharge is predictable. This property is useful in timing and oscillatory circuits. The capacity of a capacitor to store charge is measured in farads (F), though most common capacitors are rated in microfarads (μF), nanofarads (nF), or picofarads (pF), due to the farad being a relatively large unit. The amount of charge a capacitor can store depends on the surface area of the plates, the distance between them, and the type of dielectric material used. Capacitors come in many forms, with variations in size, shape, and materials used, tailored for specific applications. Types of capacitors include electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, film capacitors, and supercapacitors, each with its unique benefits and limitations. For example, electrolytic capacitors offer high capacitance values but have polarized designs and limited lifespans, while ceramic capacitors are non-polarized and suitable for high-frequency applications but typically have lower capacitance values. Overall, capacitors are integral to modern electronics, enabling the storage and manipulation of energy vital for powering, protecting, and refining the performance of circuits across a broad spectrum of applications."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This is because the preview often mirrors the fields that are displayed either in a list view or a specific form layout. Here's a generalized approach to adding a field to a preview in different scenarios: # Adding a Field to Form Layout (For Form Record Preview) 1. **Navigate to the Form**: Open the form where you want the preview to show an additional field. 2. **Configure the Form Layout**: Right-click on the form header and select **Configure > Form Layout**. Alternatively, you might find **Configure > Form Design** depending on your version of ServiceNow. 3. **Add the Field**: From the list of available fields, drag and drop the field you want into the \\"Selected\\" area on the right, placing it in the order where you want it to appear. 4. **Save**: Save your changes. # Adding a Field to List Layout (For List Record Preview) 1. **Navigate to the List**: Go to the list view from where you're previewing the record. 2. **Personalize List Columns**: Right-click on the header of any column and select **Personalize > List Columns** or simply **Configure > List Layout** depending on your version. 3. **Add the Field**: From the available columns on the left, select the field you want to add and move it to the \\"Selected\\" columns on the right. 4. **Save**: Save your changes. # For Hover Over Preview specifically: If you're referring to the hover-over preview that shows up when you hover over a reference icon, you'll need to adjust the attributes of the reference field: 1. **Navigate to the Dictionary Entry**: Go to the list of Dictionary Entries by searching for \\"Dictionary\\" in the application navigator and then open the entry for the reference field whose preview you're interested in modifying. 2. **Modify Attributes**: In the Attributes field, add or adjust the \\"ref_ac_columns\\" attribute to include the field you want in the preview. For example, if you want to add a \\"location\\" field to the preview, you would include \`ref_ac_columns=location;\`. # Note: - Your ability to make these changes will depend on your permissions in ServiceNow. - The exact labels and steps might vary slightly depending on the version of ServiceNow you're using. - For the hover-over preview adjustments, be cautious and ensure you understand the syntax and implications of modifying dictionary entries. Always consider testing changes in a development or sandbox instance before applying them to production, especially when modifying dictionary entries, to avoid unintended consequences."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

**建立规律的睡眠习惯**：每天同一时间上床睡觉和起床，哪怕是周末或节假日也不例外。 2. **营造良好的睡眠环境**：确保卧室安静、黑暗、舒适，并维持一个合适的温度。 3. **限制午间小睡时间**：如果需要午睡，尽量限制在20至30分钟内。 4. **避免晚上摄入刺激性物质**：避免在晚间摄入咖啡因和酒精，这些物质可能会影响睡眠质量。 5. **晚餐应清淡**：尽量避免晚餐过晚以及食用油腻、辛辣的食物，这些都可能影响到晚上的睡眠。 6. **维持适当的体育活动**：定期进行适当的体育活动可以帮助改善睡眠质量，但应避免在临睡前进行激烈运动。 虽然7-8小时是一般的建议，但个人差异很大。有些老人可能感到只睡6小时就已充分休息，而有些则可能需要9小时的睡眠。重要的是关注自己的身体需求，如果有睡眠困扰或日间感到明显疲倦，应该咨询医生或睡眠专家。"},{"prompt":"具体睡觉时间","completion":"具体睡觉时间可以根据个人的习惯和生活方式调整，但最关键的是保证每晚有足够的睡眠时间，并尽量维持一致的作息时间。对于大多数70岁的老人来说，建议的睡眠时间大概是晚上7-9小时。安排具体睡觉时间时，可以考虑如下因素： 1. **日常活动安排**：根据你日常的活动安排，比如早上固定时间的活动，来倒推合适的就寝和起床时间。 2. **自然睡觉倾向**：有的人是“早睡早起”的类型，有的人则倾向于“晚睡晚起”。了解自己的自然倾向可以帮你确定最适合自己的睡觉时间。 3. **体力和精神情况**：如果白天感到疲倦或精神不振，这可能意味着需要调整睡眠时间。 以保证7小时睡眠需求为例，如果你是一个早起的人，希望早上6点起床，那么你大概应该在晚上11点左右睡觉。相反，如果你喜欢晚上多一些活动的时间，希望半夜之后才睡，可能就需要晚上12点后才睡觉，但也需要相应地调整第二天的起床时间，以确保有足够的睡眠。 最重要的是，找到一个适合自己的睡眠模式，并尽量每天固定遵守，这样可以帮助调节身体的生物钟，提高睡眠质量。如果发现自己长时间睡不好，应该向医生咨询，了解是否有潜在的健康问题。"},{"prompt":"c# .net4.0 ，后台运行chrome程序","completion":"要在C#中使用.NET 4.0后台运行Chrome浏览器，可以通过Selenium

如果想要更优雅地关闭进程（例如，如果是一款GUI应用），你可能首先要尝试发送一些信号或消息来告知应用程序进行自我关闭的操作，以确保数据的完整性和资源的正确释放。对于一些应用，可能需要找到特定的参数或使用特定的API来实现这一点。对于Chrome浏览器来说，这可能比较复杂，通常直接杀死进程是一个简单而直接的方法，但在某些自动化或管理脚本中，可能会考虑其他的优雅关闭方法。"},{"prompt":"以上方法显示退出，再浏览器并没有关闭","completion":"如果使用\`Process.Kill()\`方法没有关闭浏览器，这通常是因为当你启动Chrome浏览器时，它可能会启动多个进程，并且\`Process\`对象仅与其中一个进程（通常是主进程）关联。因此，直接尝试终止这个进程可能不会关闭所有相关的Chrome进程，因此浏览器的窗口可能仍然保持打开状态。 一个解决方案是尝试通过命令行参数来启动Chrome浏览器，使其运行在一个独立的、可控的进程中。例如，在Chrome中可以使用\`--single-process\`标志（请注意，这个标志可能有副作用，如性能下降，某些Chrome版本可能不支持或不鼓励使用这个标志，仅作为技术示例）。 然而，一个通常更可靠和推荐的做法是，当你需要从C#程序中控制浏览器时，使用自动化测试工具，如Selenium WebDriver。这些工具提供了更丰富的API，用于管理浏览器的状态，包括打开、关闭窗口等。 如果确实需要直接从C#中关闭所有Chrome实例，一种方法是查找所有Chrome进程并终止它们。但请记住，这将关闭所有打开的Chrome窗口，而不仅仅是由你的应用程序启动的那些。 \`\`\`csharp // 警告：这将关闭所有Chrome浏览器的实例 foreach (var chrome in Process.GetProcessesByName(\\"chrome\\")) { try { chrome.Kill(); } catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(\\"关闭进程时出错: \\" + ex.Message); } } \`\`\` 请在使用以上代码时谨慎，因为它会关闭用户打开的所有Chrome实例，可能会造成数据丢失（比如未保存的表单数据或其他信息）。 对于实际的生产环境，如果你的应用场景是自动化测试或自动控制Chrome浏览器，则强烈建议使用Selenium WebDriver。它不仅允许你启动和停止浏览器，还可以执行复杂的浏览操作，而无需直接终止进程。此外，使用WebDriver，可以更安全、更优雅地管理浏览器实例，包括关闭特定的浏览器窗口。"},{"prompt":"如何将Process process = new Process();创建的进程不显示界面，后台运行","completion":"要创建一个不显示界面、在后台运行的进程，你需要调整\`ProcessStartInfo\`的属性。特别是，将\`CreateNoWindow\`设置为\`true\`可以防止创建窗口，而将\`UseShellExecute\`设置为\`false\`允许进程在没有使用系统外壳程序启动的情况下运行。此外，\`WindowStyle\`属性设置为\`ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden\`可以进一步确保进程窗口被隐藏。 以下是一个示例，展示了如何设置\`ProcessStartInfo\`以便在后台运行进程： \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Diagnostics; namespace ConsoleApp { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Process process = new Process(); process.StartInfo.FileName = \\"chromePath\\"; // 请替换为实际路径，例如：\\"C:Program Files (x86)GoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe\\" process.StartInfo.Arguments = \\"http://www.example.com\\"; // 请替换为实际参数 process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; process.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = true; // 防止创建窗口 process.StartInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden; // 隐藏进程窗口 process.Start(); Console.WriteLine(\\"在后台运行Chrome.\\"); // 可以在这里添加更多的代码来处理你的逻辑 } } } \`\`\` 请注意： - 将\`chromePath\`替换为Chrome的实际安装路径。通常在Windows系统上的路径可能类似于\`C:Program Files (x86)GoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe\`，但这取决于你的系统和Chrome的安装位置。 - 这种方式启动Chrome浏览器时，它可能仍然在任务管理器中显示为一个或多个活动进程，尽管没有用户界面被显示出来。 - \`UseShellExecute\`设置为\`false\`是必要的，因为它允许直接从执行文件启动进程而不使用系统的外壳程序。这也意味着你可以在\`StartInfo\`中设置更多的属性，如重定向标准输入输出流等，但本例中未展示这些内容。 - 请谨慎使用此方法来启动重要的应用程序或脚本，因为没有用户界面可能会使得错误诊断变得更加困难。 记得在实际应用代码时，根据实际需要选择合适的设置，并确保已经有对应路径下的程序或脚本可以被执行。"},{"prompt":"以上代码还是显示了窗口界面","completion":"如果您遇到了使用 \`ProcessStartInfo\` 设定后台运行但进程（如 Chrome 浏览器）仍显示窗口界面的情况，这可能是因为某些程序（尤其是 GUI 程序如网页浏览器）的设计和行为使其难以仅通过标准的 \`Process\` 类方法完全在后台运行，即使设置了 \`CreateNoWindow\` 和 \`WindowStyle.Hidden\`。对于 Chrome 浏览器而言，即使采取了上述措施，它也可能因为其多进程架构和对图形环境的需求而无法完全隐藏其界面。 一种解决方式是尝试用 Chrome 的无头模式（headless mode）来运行。无头模式是一个没有图形用户界面的浏览器运行方式，允许完全在后台执行。您可以通过设置 Chrome 的命令行参数来启用无头模式。 以下是一个更新的示例，显示如何启动 Chrome 浏览器在无头模式下运行： \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Diagnostics; namespace ConsoleApp { class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Process process = new Process(); // Chrome的路径，需要根据实际情况进行替换 process.StartInfo.FileName = @\\"C:Program Files (x86)GoogleChromeApplicationchrome.exe\\"; // 在参数中添加

process.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = true; process.Start(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Chrome在无头模式下运行.\\"); } } } \`\`\` 在这个例子中，我们添加了 \`--headless\` 参数来启动 Chrome 的无头模式。此外，\`--disable-gpu\` 用于禁用 GPU 硬件加速（过去在无头模式下启动时常常需要此设置以避免某些问题，尽管在最新版本的 Chrome 中可能不再必要）。\`--remote-debugging-port=9222\` 设置了一个用于远程调试的端口，这在进行自动化测试或开发时可能很有用。 请注意，无头模式下运行的 Chrome 并不适合所有用途，特别是如果您需要与浏览器的图形界面进行交互。但对于自动化测试、网页渲染、PDF生成等场景，这是一个非常有用的特性。"},{"prompt":"应急预案培训记录表","completion":"应急预案培训是一项关键的安全活动，旨在确保所有员工在紧急情况下知道如何安全行动。下面是一个简化的应急预案培训记录表样式，可根据实际需求进行调整和补充。 --- # 应急预案培训记录表

Apache Solr, a popular open-source search platform, supports different similarity models that affect how document relevance is calculated during a search. As of my last update in 2023, some of the commonly used similarity factories in Solr include: 1. **BM25SimilarityFactory (BM25)**: An evolution of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model, BM25 is the default similarity model in Solr. It is well-regarded for providing a balance between term frequency and document length, making it effective for a wide range of search applications. 2. **ClassicSimilarityFactory (TF-IDF)**: Before the introduction of BM25, TF-IDF was the default similarity model. It calculates the importance of a term based on its frequency in the document and its inverse frequency across all documents. While BM25 is generally preferred for its improved handling of term saturation and document length normalization, TF-IDF may still be useful in certain contexts. 3. **SchemaSimilarityFactory**: This factory allows different fields in your documents to use different similarity models. It can be useful if you know that certain fields in your documents should be weighted or analyzed differently from others when computing relevance. 4. **LMDirichletSimilarityFactory and LMSimilarityFactory**: These factories implement language models for information retrieval, which can be more effective for specific types of textual analysis or when dealing with comprehensive collections of documents. **Choosing the Best Similarity Factory:** To select the best similarity factory for your Solr instance, consider the following: - **Nature of Your Data**: The characteristics of your dataset, including document length variability and the distribution of terms, can influence which similarity model performs best. - **Search Requirements**: Different applications may prioritize certain aspects of search, such as precision, recall, or ranking consistency across different query scenarios. - **Testing and Evaluation**: Implement experimental setups using different similarity models on your dataset. Conduct testing based on your search performance criteria (e.g., relevance judgments, click-through rates) to empirically determine which model offers the best results for your use case. - **Community and Literature**: Look into case studies, research findings, and recommendations within the Solr community and broader information retrieval literature. Insights from other practitioners who have tackled similar search challenges can guide your selection. In most cases, BM25SimilarityFactory provides an excellent starting point due to its robust performance across a wide range of search scenarios. However, it's essential to analyze your specific needs and experiment with different models to find the optimal configuration for your search use case."},{"prompt":"how to add BM25SimilarityFactory to solr schema?","completion":"To use the BM25SimilarityFactory in Solr, you need to configure it in the \`schema.xml\` file. This involves defining the similarity class for either the entire index or for specific field types. By default, many versions of Solr already use BM25 as their similarity model, but if you need to customize it or ensure its use, here's how you can explicitly set it. # Step 1: Opening \`schema.xml\` Locate and open your \`schema.xml\` file within your Solr collection's configuration directory. If you're starting from a predefined configuration, this might be in a directory like \`server/solr/configsets/_default/conf/\` or a similar path depending on how your Solr instance is set up. # Step 2: Defining Global Similarity To set BM25SimilarityFactory globally for the entire index, add the following configuration within the \`<schema>\` tag but outside any \`<field>\` tags: \`\`\`xml <similarity class=\\"solr.schema.BM25SimilarityFactory\\"/> \`\`\` This setting ensures that BM25 is used across the board for similarity calculations. # Step 3: Setting Similarity for a Field Type If you prefer to use BM25 only for specific field types rather than globally, you can define it within the \`<fieldType>\` definitions. Find or create a \`<fieldType>\` block in your \`schema.xml\` file and add the \`<similarity>\` tag there. Here’s an example for a text field: \`\`\`xml <fieldType name=\\"text_bm25\\" class=\\"solr.TextField\\" positionIncrementGap=\\"100\\"> <analyzer type=\\"index\\"> ... </analyzer> <analyzer type=\\"query\\"> ... </analyzer> <similarity class=\\"solr.schema.BM25SimilarityFactory\\"/> </fieldType> \`\`\` In this example, any field specified to be of type \`text_bm25\` will use BM25 for its similarity calculations. # Step 4: Applying Field Type to Fields Ensure that your fields are using the field types with the BM25 similarity settings. Find or add \`<field>\` definitions and set their \`type\` attribute to your BM25 enabled field type. For example: \`\`\`xml <field name=\\"description\\" type=\\"text_bm25\\" indexed=\\"true\\" stored=\\"true\\"/> \`\`\` # Step 5: Restart and Reindex After making changes to \`schema.xml\`, you'll need to restart your Solr server. It’s also a good idea to reindex your data to ensure that the new similarity settings are applied correctly. # Note on Custom Parameters BM25SimilarityFactory accepts two parameters, \`k1\` and \`b\`, that influence how term frequency and document length affect scoring. The defaults are generally effective, but you can customize them if needed. To specify custom parameters, add them as attributes in the \`<similarity>\` tag like so: \`\`\`xml <similarity class=\\"solr.schema.BM25SimilarityFactory\\" k1=\\"1.2\\" b=\\"0.75\\"/> \`\`\` Adjust \`k1\` and \`b\` according to your specific requirements to fine-tune how BM25 behaves. Finally, it’s always a good practice to consult the official Solr documentation for your version of Solr, as available features and configuration options may change over time."},{"prompt":"do we need to rebuild index after updating similarity class in schema?","completion":"Yes, after updating the similarity class in the schema of an Apache Solr index, you generally need to rebuild (reindex) your index. This reindexing is necessary because the similarity settings influence how Solr scores and ranks documents during searches. Changing the similarity class effectively changes the way documents will be evaluated for relevance against queries. The existing index won't automatically reflect these changes because it was built using the scoring calculations of the previous similarity settings. Here's why reindexing is important: 1. **Scoring and Ranking**: The similarity class determines how document relevance scores are calculated for queries. Changing this class changes the underlying scoring mechanism, which can alter the rank of documents for the same query. 2. **Index Statistics**: Similarity models like BM25 and TF-IDF use index-level statistics (e.g., inverse document frequency) in their scoring algorithms. These statistics are baked into the index during indexing and need to be recalculated when the similarity model changes. 3. **Field Norms**: Many similarity models (including BM25 and Classic TF-IDF) store field normalization values in the index during the indexing process. These values are influenced by the similarity model in use (for example, document length normalization factors). Changing the similarity model after documents have already been indexed won't retroactively update these stored values, potentially leading to incorrect scoring. # Steps to Reindex in Solr: To reindex your documents after changing the similarity class: 1. **Backup Your Data**: Always start by backing up your Solr data to prevent any loss. 2. **Update Schema**: After you've made your changes to the similarity settings in the \`schema.xml\`, ensure your Solr instance is aware of the updates. This might require restarting Solr if it's not set up to automatically reload configuration changes. 3. **Clear Existing Index**: Delete the existing index to remove all documents and statistics calculated using the old similarity model. This can be done via Solr's Admin UI or using Solr's APIs, for example: \`\`\` curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/your_collection/update?commit=true' -d '<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>' \`\`\` 4. **Reindex Data**: Submit your documents for indexing again. This process will build the index afresh, applying the new similarity settings to correctly calculate score and ranking. 5. **Verify**: After reindexing, perform tests to ensure the new similarity model behaves as expected with your data and query patterns. Changing the similarity model is a fundamental alteration to how search results are computed, so reindexing is essential whenever you make such a modification. Always plan for the reindexing process, including the necessary resources and time, especially for large datasets."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Below are the steps to customize the preview shown when hovering over the 'Caller' reference field in an Incident form. These steps assume you have the necessary permissions to perform system configurations. # 1. Modify Dictionary Attributes for the Caller Field: 1. **Navigate to Dictionary**: Go to the \`System Dictionary\` by typing \\"Dictionary\\" in the filter navigator. 2. **Search for the Caller Field**: You need to find the dictionary entry for the Caller field on the Incident table. This can typically be done by filtering the list with \`Table\` is \`Incident\` and \`Column name\` is \`caller_id\`. 3. **Edit the Dictionary Entry**: Open the dictionary record for the Caller field. 4. **Modify Attributes**: In the \`Attributes\` field, you may need to add or modify the \`ref_contributions\` attribute to control what is displayed on the hover preview. You could specify the fields you want to include. The syntax is a bit nuanced and might involve script includes or advanced configurations specific to your ServiceNow version or customization level. By default, ServiceNow doesn’t offer a straightforward attribute to list fields; it's more about controlling the actions available on the hover preview. As of my last update, ServiceNow doesn't provide a direct \`ref_contributions\` attribute to simply list fields to display on hover. Usually, the hover preview shows the form view set for the reference table, which brings us to an alternative approach. # 2. Customize the Form View Used in Hover Previews: Instead of, or in addition to, manipulating dictionary attributes, adjusting which form view is displayed in hover previews can achieve your goal. 1. **Identify the Default Hover Form View**: ServiceNow uses the default form view for hover previews unless specified otherwise. Determine if there’s a specific view used for hovers in your configuration. 2. **Customize/Create a Form View**: Go to the \`User [sys_user]\` table (or the relevant table for your caller field) and customize or create a new form view that includes only the Name and Country fields. 3. **Assign the Form View to Hover Previews**: You might need a System Administrator to set this customized form view as the default for hover previews for the Caller field. This often requires custom scripting or a system property to indicate that hover previews for the \`caller_id\` field should use this new view. Unfortunately, ServiceNow's native configuration options for altering hover preview behavior are limited and might not directly support specifying exact fields through simple configurations or attributes. If the steps above do not align with your ServiceNow instance's capabilities or version, consider reaching out to ServiceNow support or consulting the ServiceNow Developer Program and community forums for more specific guidance or possible custom solutions involving client scripts or UI Policies. Remember, direct modifications can impact user experience and system performance, so test any changes in a sub-production instance before applying them to your live environment."},{"prompt":"what to modify the ref_contributions attribute to see the field","completion":"As of the last update, directly controlling the fields displayed in a hover preview (reference field pop-up) using the \`ref_contributions\` attribute in ServiceNow is not straightforward. The \`ref_contributions\` attribute is typically used for adding UI actions, related lists, or enabling certain JavaScript controls on the reference field's hover window or reference selector, rather than directly specifying fields to be displayed. However, to achieve the display of specific fields (e.g., Name and Country) in the hover preview for a reference field such as the caller in an incident, you have a couple of alternative strategies: # 1. Customizing the Form Layout for the Reference Table The hover preview generally shows the form view designed for the referenced record. To control which fields are visible, you can either modify an existing form view or create a new one and then instruct the reference field to use this view for its preview. 1. **Navigate to Form Design**: - Go to the referenced table (e.g., User [sys_user] for Caller) and access the form configuration by right-clicking on the header of a record and selecting \\"Configure\\" -> \\"Form Layout.\\" 2. **Customize/Create a Form View**: - Either modify the existing \\"Default\\" view (not recommended if it's used elsewhere in your application) or create a new form view by simply arranging only the fields you want to be visible (Name and Country in this case). 3. **Assign the Custom Form View to Hover Preview**: - This step depends on whether your version/setup of ServiceNow supports directly setting a specific form view for hover previews via UI. If not, this might involve a more in-depth customization such as scripting or potentially updating the reference field's dictionary attributes to implicitly use the newly created view. Typically, this kind of customization might be limited by out-of-the-box capabilities and could require creative solutions like client scripts that manipulate the DOM (not recommended due to potential performance and upgradeability issues). # 2. System Properties Sometimes, the behavior of reference field hover previews can be influenced by system properties. You may explore \`sys_properties\` for any properties related to reference field displays or hover behavior, although there's no direct property to specify fields as of the last update. To check or modify system properties: - Navigate to \\"System Properties\\" via the filter navigator and search for properties related to references or hovers. Note that any changes here affect the system globally, so proceed with caution. # Consider Scripting Only as a Last Resort It's worth noting that directly injecting JavaScript to alter the DOM for displaying specific fields in hover previews is highly discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it can introduce performance issues, impact upgradability, and lead to unexpected behavior during system updates. # Conclusion Without direct attribute manipulation options for specifying fields in the hover preview, the recommended approach involves adjusting form views or potentially seeking custom development solutions. Given the potential complexity and unintended consequences of custom solutions, consider reaching out to ServiceNow community forums, your ServiceNow representative, or consulting services for guidance tailored to your specific version and business needs. Always test any changes in a development or sub-production instance before applying them to your live environment."},{"prompt":"Viết cho tôi Lời cảm ơn cho đề tài báo cáo thực tập “Thực trạng bạo lực gia đình hiện nay và định hướng hoàn thiện”","completion":"Thưa quý thầy cô và các bạn, Chúng tôi xin chân thành cảm ơn quý thầy cô đã dành thời gian và kiến thức để hướng dẫn và hỗ trợ chúng tôi trong quá trình thực tập về đề tài \\"Thực trạng bạo lực gia đình hiện nay và định hướng hoàn thiện\\".

You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Before Reinhardt can respond, one of the guards, growing impatient, grabs at his turtleneck. Reinhardt instinctively reacts, a burst of fire and ash erupting from him, pushing the guards back. **Royal Guard #2**, recovering, outraged: Witchcraft! Demon! The guards, now seeing Reinhardt as a threat, act without hesitation. There's a brief, chaotic skirmish, and tragically, Reinhardt is struck down fatally. As the guards, believing the threat neutralized, turn to leave, the air shifts. Reinhardt's body, which should have been lifeless, begins to twitch. The guards stop, turning back in shock as Reinhardt's eyes flash open, glowing an ominous red. But his voice, when he speaks, isn't his own. **Reinhardt** (Another Soul speaking): Oh, what short-sighted creatures, bound by the chains of your limited perception. **Royal Guard Leader**, gripping his weapon tighter, takes a step back: What sorcery is this? **Reinhardt** (Another Soul): Do not fear me, guardians of order. I am but a visitor in this vessel, awakened by the brink of death. Your actions have summoned knowledge far beyond your understanding. The atmosphere is tense, the guards unsure how to react. **Royal Guard#2**: What do you want from us, spirit? **Reinhardt** (Another Soul), his red eyes piercing the dim light: I seek nothing from you. But let this moment enlighten you on the mysteries that walk your world unseen. Be wary of whom you judge to be a threat, for not all is as it appears. Slowly, Reinhardt rises to his feet, the glow in his eyes dimming as if the extraordinary occurrence was but a shared hallucination. **Royal Guard Leader**, a mix of fear and awe in his voice: Who...who are you? **Reinhardt** (recovering, his voice returning to normal): I am simply Reinhardt, a traveler with more questions than answers. My apologies for the disturbance. With a bow, Reinhardt turns and vanishes into the shadows of the alley, leaving the royal guards in stunned silence, grappling with the reality that their world is filled with wonders and horrors beyond their comprehension."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: Назови виды массивов в pythonASSISTANT:","completion":"В Python различают несколько типов массивов, организация которых зависит от понимания термина \\"массив\\" в контексте. В Python нет встроенного типа \\"массив\\" в том виде, как это принято в некоторых других языках программирования. Однако есть несколько структур данных, которые могут использоваться как массивы: 1. **Списки (Lists)** – это самая гибкая структура данных в Python, представляющая собой упорядоченную коллекцию элементов (могут быть разных типов). Списки поддерживают операции добавления, удаления и изменения элементов. 2. **Кортежи (Tuples)** – это неизменяемые (immutable) последовательности, которые работают аналогично спискам, но не позволяют изменять содержащиеся в них элементы после создания. Кортежи чаще используются для хранения записей, где позиция элемента имеет значение. 3. **Массивы (Arrays)** – для работы с массивами в более традиционном понимании (например, массив чисел) в Python можно использовать модуль \`array\`. Модуль \`array\` предоставляет объекты, которые как и списки, но с ограничением по типу хранящихся элементов, что бывает полезно для эффективной работы с данными в некоторых задачах. 4. **Массивы NumPy** – для научных вычислений или работы с большими объемами данных по элементам обычно используют библиотеку NumPy, которая предоставляет многомерные массивы и широкий спектр инструментов для работы с ними. Arrays NumPy подходят для выполнения операций линейной алгебры, статистической обработки данных и многого другого. 5. **Списки списков (List of lists)** – можно использовать для создания многомерных массивов, где каждый элемент списка является другим списком. Это может пригодиться для работы с матрицами или табличными данными.

The role of media in this conflict is central and has become increasingly significant in shaping narratives, public opinion, and perceptions of the conflict on both sides. In particular, Israel's media function and use of Psychological Operations (PSYOPs) have played a crucial role in promoting Israeli government policies, justifying military actions, and influencing public discourse both domestically and internationally. Israel, as a democratic state with a relatively free and diverse media landscape, has utilized its media function to promote government narratives and policies, particularly in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli media often portrays the conflict as a matter of national security and self-defense, emphasizing the threats posed by Palestinian militants and justifying military actions as necessary measures to protect Israeli citizens. This framing of the conflict as a defensive and existential issue has been used to consolidate domestic support for government policies and military actions, as well as to shape public opinion both at home and abroad. In addition to the mainstream media, Israel has also been known to engage in Psychological Operations (PSYOPs) during times of conflict with Palestine. Psychological Operations are a form of information warfare that seeks to influence the emotions, attitudes, and behavior of individuals or groups in order to achieve strategic goals. Israel has been criticized for employing deceptive tactics, misinformation, propaganda, and manipulation of social media to disseminate its narrative and discredit the Palestinian cause. These tactics are aimed at shaping public opinion, manipulating perceptions of the conflict, and legitimizing Israeli actions in the eyes of the public. During times of conflict, the Israeli government and military have used media outlets to disseminate information that portrays Palestinians as aggressors, terrorists, and threats to Israeli security. This narrative is often used to justify military operations, portray Israeli actions as defensive responses to Palestinian aggression, and evoke sympathy and support from both the Israeli public and the international community. By framing the conflict in this way, Israel seeks to rally public opinion behind government policies and actions, and to undermine the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance movements. Furthermore, Israel has been accused of using social media platforms to conduct PSYOPs aimed at shaping public opinion in its favor. These tactics include spreading fake news, disinformation, and propaganda to discredit Palestinian narratives, delegitimize Palestinian aspirations for statehood, and manipulate public perception of the conflict. By deploying these tactics on social media, Israel seeks to influence a wide audience, including domestic and international audiences, and to control the narrative surrounding the conflict. Critics argue that Israel's use of media and PSYOPs in the conflict with Palestine is part of a broader strategy to manipulate public opinion, control the flow of information, and undermine the Palestinian cause. They argue that these tactics contribute to the perpetuation of the conflict, fuel mistrust and animosity between the two sides, and hinder efforts towards peaceful resolution and reconciliation. Additionally, they suggest that the use of propaganda and misinformation in the media erodes the credibility of journalistic standards and ethical practices, and undermines the public's ability to discern truth from manipulation. On the other hand, supporters of Israel's media function and PSYOPs argue that they are necessary tools in the context of a complex and protracted conflict, where narratives, perceptions, and public opinion play a crucial role in shaping political outcomes. They argue that Israel's use of media and information warfare is a legitimate means to defend national security, counter threats to its citizens, and promote its interests on the world stage. They contend that the portrayal of the conflict as a matter of self-defense and security is a valid and necessary narrative to counteract anti-Israel bias and misinformation in the media. In conclusion, the role of media and psychological operations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a complex and contentious issue that warrants critical analysis and scrutiny. The use of media by Israel to promote government policies, shape public opinion, and conduct psychological operations has significant implications for the conflict, as well as for the wider landscape of information warfare and strategic communication.

The setting is an abandoned cityscape at dusk, where shadows play freely, and the air bristles with latent power. Neferpitou, intrigued by the unique aura emanating from Reinhardt, approaches him with a predatory grace. **Neferpitou**: \\"What an unusual aura you have. It's not often I encounter someone who piques my interest this much.\\" **Reinhardt**, maintaining a neutral stance, sizes up Neferpitou, realizing the potential threat they pose. Despite his powerful lineage and abilities, he prefers to avoid unnecessary confrontation. **Reinhardt**: \\"I'm just passing through. There's no need for conflict.\\" **Neferpitou** smirks, their fascination growing. \\"But conflict is the essence of evolution. How can I ignore someone as unique as you?\\" A tense moment passes as Reinhardt understands negotiation is futile. His eyes momentarily flicker red, gleaning every piece of knowledge about Neferpitou's abilities, but he keeps his findings to himself, seeking a peaceful resolution. Suddenly, Neferpitou attacks, faster than an ordinary eye can follow. Reinhardt, caught off guard, is fatally wounded. He collapses, and Neferpitou turns away, believing their curiosity satisfactorily concluded with Reinhardt's death. However, as they walk away, an eerie glow emanates from Reinhardt's body.

They hadn't anticipated this development. **Neferpitou**: \\"What sorcery is this? Who are you?\\" **Reinhardt’s Body (New Soul)**: \\"I am but a visitor in this shell. A consciousness from beyond, awakened by this young man's resilience.\\" Neferpitou, intrigued but cautious, steps closer. \\"And what does this visitor seek in speaking with me?\\" **Reinhardt’s Body (New Soul)**: \\"To convey a message. Power is not merely in subjugation and destruction. It's in what one chooses to protect. This boy... he carries a legacy of fire and knowledge, choosing to shield rather than to scorch.\\" Neferpitou, known for their own ruthless efficiency in combat, finds themselves momentarily pondering the words. **Neferpitou**: \\"And if I refuse to heed this... 'message'?\\" **Reinhardt’s Body (New Soul)**: \\"That is your choice. But know this — the power to resurrect, to return from the ash, speaks of a spirit not easily quenched.

The encounter has shifted something within them, an acknowledgment of Reinhardt's unique existence. **Neferpitou**: \\"Consider yourself fortunate, hybrid. Your life's thread weaves a complex tapestry.\\" With a final nod, Neferpitou turns and vanishes into the growing darkness, leaving Reinhardt alone with his thoughts and the silent city.

В Python нет встроенного типа “массив” в том виде, как это принято в некоторых других языках программирования. Однако есть несколько структур данных, которые могут использоваться как массивы:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Списки (Lists)</strong> – это самая гибкая структура данных в Python, представляющая собой упорядоченную коллекцию элементов (могут быть разных типов). Списки поддерживают операции добавления, удаления и изменения элементов.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Кортежи (Tuples)</strong> – это неизменяемые (immutable) последовательности, которые работают аналогично спискам, но не позволяют изменять содержащиеся в них элементы после создания. Кортежи чаще используются для хранения записей, где позиция элемента имеет значение.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Массивы (Arrays)</strong> – для работы с массивами в более традиционном понимании (например, массив чисел) в Python можно использовать модуль <code>array</code>. Модуль <code>array</code> предоставляет объекты, которые как и списки, но с ограничением по типу хранящихся элементов, что бывает полезно для эффективной работы с данными в некоторых задачах.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Массивы NumPy</strong> – для научных вычислений или работы с большими объемами данных по элементам обычно используют библиотеку NumPy, которая предоставляет многомерные массивы и широкий спектр инструментов для работы с ними. Arrays NumPy подходят для выполнения операций линейной алгебры, статистической обработки данных и многого другого.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Списки списков (List of lists)</strong> – можно использовать для создания многомерных массивов, где каждый элемент списка является другим списком. Это может пригодиться для работы с матрицами или табличными данными.<br/><br/>Выбор того или иного “вида массива” в Python зависит от конкретной задачи, её требований к эффективности и типу данных, с которыми предстоит работать.USER: А библиотеки относятся к массивам в python?ASSISTANT:","completion":"Да, в Python существуют специализированные библиотеки, которые предоставляют расширенные возможности для работы с массивами. Эти библиотеки разработаны для специфических целей, таких как научные вычисления, анализ данных или математические операции, и могут значительно упростить и ускорить выполнение соответствующих задач. Ниже перечислены некоторые из наиболее часто используемых библиотек для работы с массивами в Python: 1. **NumPy** – это базовая библиотека для научных вычислений в Python. Она предоставляет поддержку больших многомерных массивов и матриц, вместе с широким набором математических функций для эффективной работы с этими данными. Библиотека оптимизирована для высокой производительности и является стандартом для многомерных массивов. 2. **Pandas** – библиотека, предназначенная для анализа и обработки данных. Структура данных DataFrame, представленная в Pandas, фактически работает как двумерный массив или табличка, предоставляя множество удобных инструментов для работы с табличными данными, включая загрузку, обработку и анализ данных из различных источников. 3. **SciPy** – это библиотека, которая использует массивы NumPy для научных и технических вычислений. Она предоставляет модули для оптимизации, интеграции, интерполяции, собственных значений, статистики и многого другого. SciPy строится на основе NumPy, добавляя значительные возможности для различных научных вычислений. 4. **Matplotlib** – хотя это в основном библиотека визуализации для Python, она тесно интегрирована с массивами NumPy, позволяя эффективно визуализировать данные, организованные в виде массивов. Эти библиотеки и их структуры данных, хоть и не называются \\"массивами\\" в строгом смысле, выступают в качестве мощных инструментов для работы с массивоподобными структурами данных в Python, обеспечивая функциональность, которая во многом превосходит возможности традиционных массивов в других языках программирования."},{"prompt":"다음은 어떤 내용인지 한글로 설명해주세요.

It provides a powerful and elegant framework for understanding the solvability of polynomial equations and the structure of field extensions. Galois theory connects field theory, group theory, and the theory of polynomial equations, making it central to modern algebra. # Key Concepts and Ideas - **Fields and Field Extensions:** In algebra, a field is a set equipped with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain properties akin to those of the rational, real, and complex numbers. A field extension is a larger field that contains a smaller field as a subfield. For example, the complex numbers form an extension of the real numbers. - **Polynomials:** Polynomial equations are mathematical expressions involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. Solutions to polynomial equations over fields are central objects of study in Galois theory. - **Galois Groups:** The Galois group of a field extension is a group that describes the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial equation. It is defined as the group of field automorphisms (bijective maps from the field to itself that respect the field operations) of the extension field that leave the base field fixed. The structure of the Galois group helps determine whether a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals (that is, its solutions can be expressed using only the arithmetic operations and nth roots). - **Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory:** This theorem establishes a deep connection between the subgroups of the Galois group of a field extension and the subfields of that extension. Specifically, it provides a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields of a given extension and the subgroups of its Galois group. This correspondence is crucial for analyzing solvability and for understanding the structure of field extensions. - **Solvability by Radicals:** A polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if its roots can be expressed in terms of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking nth roots. Galois theory shows that a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group (a group that can be broken down into a series of abelian subgroups). # Historical Context Galois theory was developed by Évariste Galois in the early 19th century and is often considered one of the greatest achievements in the history of mathematics. Galois introduced these ideas to solve a longstanding problem: determining which polynomial equations can be solved by radicals. His work laid the foundation for much of modern algebra and influenced various areas of mathematics. # Impact and Applications Galois theory has profound implications in mathematics and beyond. It not only classifies the solvability of polynomial equations but also has applications in number theory, algebraic geometry, and cryptography. Its concepts and techniques have been instrumental in the development of modern abstract algebra and have contributed to our understanding of the structure and symmetries of mathematical objects. In summary, Galois theory is a cornerstone of modern algebra with wide-reaching implications and applications. It provides a framework that connects field theory, group theory, and polynomial equations, offering deep insights into the solvability and structure of algebraic equations."},{"prompt":"Explain deeper using symbols and equations","completion":"To delve deeper into the concepts of Galois theory using symbols and equations, let's focus on some of its fundamental aspects. # Fields and Field Extensions A field (F) is a set on which two operations, addition (+) and multiplication (·), are defined so that for every (a, b, c in F): 1. (a + b = b + a) and (a · b = b · a) (Commutativity) 2. (a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c) and (a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c) (Associativity) 3. There exists an element (0 in F) such that (a + 0 = a), and an element (1 in F) ((1 neq 0)) such that (a · 1 = a) (Identity elements) 4. For each (a in F), there exists (-a in F) such that (a + (-a) = 0), and for each (a in F, a neq 0), there exists (a^{-1} in F) such that (a · a^{-1} = 1) (Inverses) 5. (a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c) (Distributivity) A field extension (E/F) is a field (E) containing (F) such that the operations of (F) are the restrictions of the operations of (E). # Polynomials and Roots Consider a polynomial (f(x)) with coefficients in a field (F): [ f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1x + a_0 ] where (a_i in F) and (a_n neq 0). The roots of (f(x)) are the solutions to (f(x) = 0). # Galois Groups The Galois group of a polynomial (f(x)) over a field (F), denoted (Gal(E/F)), where (E) is a splitting field of (f(x)) over (F), is defined as the group of all field automorphisms of (E) that fix (F). An automorphism (sigma) of (E) fixes (F) if (sigma(a) = a) for all (a in F). # Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory Let (E/F) be a finite Galois extension. Then, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subfields (K) of (E) containing (F), and the subgroups (H) of the Galois group (Gal(E/F)), such that (K = E^H) (the elements of (E) fixed by (H)) and (H = Gal(E/K)). # Example of Solvability by Radicals A classic example is the general polynomial of degree (5) or higher. The Abel-Ruffini theorem states that there are equations of degree five or higher that cannot be solved by a general formula involving only arithmetic operations and radicals. According to Galois theory, this is because the Galois group of a general polynomial of degree (n geq 5) can be the symmetric group (S_n), which is not solvable for (n geq 5). # Specific Equation Example Consider the polynomial (f(x) = x^2 - 2) over the rational numbers (mathbb{Q}). The roots are (sqrt{2}) and (-sqrt{2}), and they generate the field (mathbb{Q}(sqrt{2})), which is an extension of (mathbb{Q}). The Galois group of this extension is (mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z}), which corresponds to the two automorphisms: the identity map (leaving every element fixed) and the map sending (sqrt{2}) to (-sqrt{2}). This group is abelian, thus solvable, reflecting the fact that the roots can indeed be expressed using radicals. Through these concepts and examples, Galois theory provides a profound understanding of the structure of field extensions and the solvability of polynomial equations, linking field theory and group theory in a beautiful and intricate manner."},{"prompt":"python中string如何去掉某些字符串，考虑string中不一定存在想要去掉的字符串的情况","completion":"在Python中去掉字符串中的某些字符或子字符串，我们一般可以使用\`replace()\`方法，\`str.replace(old, new[, count])\`方法会返回字符串的副本，副本中的\`old\`字符串会被\`new\`字符串替换，如果指定了\`count\`，则只替换前\`count\`次出现。如果在原字符串中不存在想要去掉的字符串，使用\`replace\`方法不会有任何影响。 下面是一个例子： \`\`\`python # 原始字符串 original_string = \\"Hello, World!\\" # 想要去掉的字符串 to_remove = \\"World\\" # 检查字符串中是否包含想要去除的部分 if to_remove in original_string: # 使用replace()去掉指定的字符串 new_string = original_string.replace(to_remove, \\"\\") else: # 原字符串中不包含指定去除的字符串 print(\\"The string to be removed was not found.\\") new_string = original_string print(\\"Original String:\\", original_string) print(\\"After Removal:\\", new_string) \`\`\` 这个例子中，\`replace()\`方法会将\`\\"Hello, World!\\"\`中的\`\\"World\\"\`替换为空字符串，即去除掉了\`\\"World\\"\`，最终得到结果是\`\\"Hello, !\\"\`。 若想要去掉的字符串不存在于原字符串中，则\`replace\`方法不会改变原字符串，你仍然会得到原字符串。这样的设计可以让你不必担心在不存在目标字符串时进行错误处理。 如果需要去除的是多个不同的字符串，可能需要多次使用\`replace\`方法，或者考虑使用正则表达式（通过\`re.sub()\`方法）针对复杂的替换规则进行处理。 例如，使用正则表达式去除多个不同的字符串： \`\`\`python import re # 原始字符串 original_string = \\"Hello, World! Welcome to Python programming.\\" # 通过正则表达式替换多个不同的字符串 new_string = re.sub(r\\"World|Welcome|Python\\", \\"\\", original_string) print(\\"Original String:\\", original_string) print(\\"After Removal:\\", new_string) \`\`\` 在这个例子中，\`re.sub\`方法用于替换所有匹配到的字符串（在这里是 \`\\"World\\"\`、\`\\"Welcome\\"\`、和 \`\\"Python\\"\`）为一个空字符串，即去除这些字符串。"},{"prompt":"python中tuple的性质","completion":"在Python中，元组（tuple）是一个基本的数据结构类型，用于存储一系列的项目。元组是有序的，这意味着项目会按照添加的顺序保留下来。元组的几个关键性质如下： 1. **不可变性 (Immutability)**: 元组一旦创建，其中的元素就不能被修改。这意味着你不能添加、删除或改变元组中的项目。如果需要一个可修改的数据类型，可以使用列表（list）。 2. **允许重复的元素**: 元组可以包含重复的元素。例如，\`(1, 2, 3, 2)\` 是一个合法的元组，其中数字 \`2\` 出现了两次。 3. **可以包含不同类型的元素**: 元组中的元素可以是不同类型的，例如 \`(1, 'a', 3.14, [1, 2, 3])\` 是一个有效的元组，它包含了整数、字符串、浮点数和列表。 4. **有序**: 元组中的元素是有序的，这意味着它们的排列顺序是稳定的，可以通过索引来访问元组中的元素。 5. **支持索引和切片操作**: 通过使用索引，你可以访问元组中的特定元素。通过切片操作，你可以获取元组的一部分。 6. **可哈希**: 由于元组的不可变性，它们可以作为字典的键和集合（set）的元素。但是，如果元组包含任何不可哈希的元素（如列表），则该元组也是不可哈希的。 7. **内置方法**: 元组有限的内置方法可用，主要是 \`count()\` 和 \`index()\`。\`count(x)\` 方法返回元组中元素 \`x\` 出现的次数，\`index(x)\` 方法返回元素 \`x\` 第一次出现的索引位置。 下面是一个简单的元组示例： \`\`\`python # 创建一个元组 my_tuple = (1, 'hello', 3.14) # 访问元组的第二个元素 print(my_tuple[1]) # 输出: hello # 尝试修改元组会导致错误 # my_tuple[1] = 'world' # 这将抛出TypeError # 元组的遍历 for item in my_tuple: print(item) # 元组切片 print(my_tuple[:2]) # 输出: (1, 'hello') \`\`\` 元组由于其简单性和性能优势（相对于列表），在需要确保数据不被修改的场景广泛使用。"},{"prompt":"python中f=open('1.json') cont=f.read() cont最多可以是多少字符？","completion":"在Python中，使用\`f=open('1.json')\`后调用\`f.read()\`来读取文件内容时，理论上读取的字符数量没有硬性的上限，它主要受到以下几个因素的限制： 1. **系统内存**: \`f.read()\`实际上会将文件的全部内容读取到内存中，因此文件的大小直接受限于系统可分配给Python进程的内存量。如果文件非常大，会占用大量的内存，可能会导致系统变慢或Python进程被操作系统强制终止。 2. **操作系统限制**: 不同的操作系统和文件系统可能对单个文件的最大大小有不同的限制。这意味着文件的大小可能受到文件系统的限制，从而间接影响\`f.read()\`能读取的最大字符数。 3. **Python的实现和版本**: 不同的Python实现（如CPython, PyPy）以及不同版本间的内部优化和限制可能会对最大可读字符数产生影响。 4. **文件编码**: 如果读取的文件是文本文件，其编码（如UTF-8, ASCII）也会影响可读取的最大字符数，因为不同的字符可能需要不同数量的字节来表示。 实际使用中，为了避免潜在的内存问题，对于大文件，建议不要一次性读取文件全部内容。相反，可以考虑逐行读取或使用一定大小的缓冲区来分批次处理文件内容，例如： \`\`\`python with open('1.json', 'r') as f: for line in f: # 处理每一行 pass # 或者分块读取 chunk_size = 1024 # 1024字节，即1KB with open('1.json', 'r') as f: while True: chunk = f.read(chunk_size) if not chunk: break # 处理这一块的内容 pass \`\`\` 这种方式可以有效地减少内存使用，特别是在处理大型文件时。"},{"prompt":"python中读取保存json文件的方法","completion":"在Python中，处理JSON数据可以使用标准库\`json\`，这个库提供了简单的方法来编码和解码JSON数据。下面是使用\`json\`库读取和保存JSON文件的基本方法： # 读取JSON文件 要从文件中读取JSON数据，可以使用\`json.load()\`函数。这个函数将文件内容解析成Python的数据类型。 \`\`\`python import json # 打开JSON文件并读取数据 with open('data.json', 'r') as f: data = json.load(f) # 使用读取到的数据（data是一个Python字典或列表，取决于JSON数据的结构） print(data) \`\`\` # 保存（写入）JSON文件 要将Python数据保存到JSON文件中，可以使用\`json.dump()\`函数。这个函数接受Python数据类型（通常是字典或列表），并将其编码为JSON字符串写入文件中。 \`\`\`python import json # 要保存的数据 data = { 'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 30, 'is_employee': True, 'skills': ['Python', 'Data Analysis'] } # 打开一个文件用于写入JSON数据 with open('output.json', 'w') as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=4) # 使用indent参数美化输出 \`\`\` 在\`json.dump()\`函数中，\`indent\`参数是可选的，用于指定缩进量，这样生成的JSON文件会更易于阅读。如果不需要美化输出，可以省略这个参数。 # 处理非ASCII字符和其他选项 在写入JSON数据时，你可能还会遇到一些选项，比如如何处理非ASCII字符。\`json.dump()\`和\`json.dumps()\`函数提供了\`ensure_ascii\`参数，默认值为\`True\`。当\`ensure_ascii=True\`时，所有非ASCII字符都会被转义；设置为\`False\`时，它们将按原样输出。 \`\`\`python with open('output.json', 'w', encoding='utf8') as f: json.dump(data, f, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False) \`\`\` 在这个例子中，还显式设置了文件的编码为'utf8'，确保正确处理Unicode字符。 使用\`json\`库处理JSON数据既简单又直观，适用于大多数需要读取或写入JSON文件的情况。"},{"prompt":"详细介绍伊利的舒化奶","completion":"伊利舒化奶是中国著名乳制品公司伊利集团推出的一款乳制品，它针对特定消费者群体设计，特别是那些对乳糖不耐受或有消化吸收问题的人群。乳糖不耐受是指人体内缺乏足够的乳糖酶，无法完全分解乳糖，从而导致消化不良的症状，如腹胀、腹泻等。伊利舒化奶通过特殊工艺处理，降低乳糖含量，使得乳糖不耐受者也能够享用牛奶的营养与美味。 # 主要特点 1. **乳糖含量低**: 通过特殊的技术处理，伊利舒化奶的乳糖含量相对较低，因此，即便是乳糖不耐受的人群也能够较好地消化吸收。 2. **营养丰富**: 尽管经过了乳糖分解的处理，舒化奶依然保留了牛奶中的主要营养成分，如蛋白质、钙、维生素D等，有助于补充日常所需的主要营养。 3. **口感接近普通牛奶**: 舒化奶在口感上尽量保持了牛奶的自然风味和口感，尽可能减少处理过程中对口感的影响。 4. **安全高标准**: 伊利作为中国乳制品行业的龙头企业，其产品生产过程严格控制，确保产品安全、卫生，满足国家和国际上的食品安全标准。 # 应用人群 -

Gas giants are typically known for their thick atmospheres composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium, with varying amounts of other gases like ammonia, water vapor, and methane, depending on the specific planet. However, the idea of hazes of rocks introduces a novel aspect to these celestial bodies, suggesting an environment where solid particles are suspended within the gas giant's upper atmosphere. This phenomenon can occur under specific conditions and involves very small, solid particles or dust made of minerals or rock-forming elements such as silicon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium. These particles can form clouds or hazes in the upper layers of the atmosphere due to various processes. One possibility is that such particles originate from moons or rings surrounding the gas giant, which are then swept up by the planet's atmosphere. Another possibility is the condensation of minerals vaporized by intense heat and pressure from the lower atmosphere, rising and then cooling to form solid particles. The presence of such hazes can significantly impact the planet's appearance, atmospheric chemistry, and thermal structure. For instance, these particulates can scatter sunlight, leading to unique colorations and brightness variations in the planet's appearance. Furthermore, these mineral hazes could influence the chemistry of the upper atmosphere by acting as sites for chemical reactions or by impacting the atmospheric temperature through their interactions with solar radiation. This concept draws parallels to Saturn's moon Titan and exoplanet studies. Titan, for example, is known for its complex atmosphere with organic hazes, though not composed of rocks, showing that bodies in the solar system can have intricate atmospheric compositions. In exoplanet research, studies have suggested that some hot Jupiters (a class of gas giants that orbit very closely to their stars) could have atmospheric hazes composed of particles formed from vaporized metals and silicates, hinting at the vast range of atmospheric conditions possible in gas giants. The exploration of such atmospheric phenomena extends our understanding of planetary science, pushing the boundaries of what is considered possible within the diverse environments of gas giants."},{"prompt":"i have historical data of some crypto currencies as csv files i have following code to train a standard NN on my data check and see if the code is correct: #

Here are a few observations and suggestions to ensure it performs as expected: 1. **Data Preprocessing:** - Ensure that all necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical features if any) besides scaling are performed before training. Since this is not shown in the code, assume it's either not needed or done beforehand. 2. **Generator Function:** - In the \`data_generator\` function, there's a variable naming inconsistency: \`y_priority_1d\` is later referenced as \`y_priority_batch_1d\` without initialization. It seems like a typo because you initialize variables such as \`y_high_batch_1d\` from \`y_high_1d[i:end]\`, but then you incorrectly attempt to use \`y_priority_1d[i:end]\` which should be \`y_Priority_1d[i:end]\` (note the uppercase P in \`Priority\`). Make sure variable names are consistent to avoid runtime errors. This is observed for all corresponding \`y_*\` variables. 3. **Input Shape:** - The \`input_shape\` variable seemed to be hardcoded with the value \`(6427,)\`. Ensure this matches the number of features in your dataset after preprocessing. It's generally a good practice to dynamically ascertain this value based on the data rather than hardcoding it. 4. **Dropout Layers:** - You're correctly using dropout layers to reduce overfitting, which is good. Just ensure the dropout rates are optimal for your specific use case as too much dropout can also lead to underfitting. 5. **Multiple Outputs:** - Your network design addressing multiple outputs (i.e., high, low, priority for different days) is thoughtful. Ensure that your data and business problem truly require separate predictions for each of these and that combining them into a fewer number of outputs wouldn't be more beneficial. 6. **Loss Weights:** - You have set equal loss weights across all outputs. If you find that certain predictions are more important or harder to predict, consider adjusting these weights accordingly. 7. **Model Training:** - You're using a large number of epochs (\`1000\`). Ensure you have mechanisms like early stopping in place to prevent overfitting if necessary. You might also want to add callback functions for checkpointing your model. 8. **Batch Size Alignment:** - Ensure that the batch size you chose works well with the amount of data you have. Since you're generating data in batches, having too large or too small batches might affect learning dynamics or computational efficiency. 9. **File Handling:** - Assuming your dataset isn't changing frequently, consider merging your CSV files into a single file or database that might speed up data loading. I/O operations can become a bottleneck when working with many small files. 10. **Additional Considerations:** - Depending on the framework version and dependencies, ensure all features like \`Model\`, \`Input\`, \`Dense\`, etc., are imported and utilized correctly as per the documentation. - You might also want to explore other model architectures or additional feature engineering techniques that could improve the performance on your specific dataset. Overall, this code provides a good starting point. Keep iterating on your model based on the performance metrics and consider incorporating strategies like cross-validation for a more robust evaluation."},{"prompt":"Find a game that was on DOS or Windows, under the years 2000, where you where a snail or a caterpillar, in a garden in first person.

They run on DOS and early Windows systems. In \\"Let's Explore the Jungle with Buzzy the Knowledge Bug,\\" while you're not exactly playing as a snail or a caterpillar, Buzzy acts as your guide through the game's environments, and the exploration aspect in a garden or jungle setting could match your description. The gameplay involves pointing and clicking to move to different locations, learn facts, and play mini-games, fitting your mention of using cardinal points for displacement. However, it's worth noting that the specific detail of being a snail or caterpillar doesn't exactly match, suggesting there might be some mix-up with the actual character you play as or interact with. If you're adamant about the character being a snail or a caterpillar, it's possible the game you're remembering might be a less widely known title or educational software from the era, as there were many such games developed for children during the late 90s and early 2000s.

The description is quite unique, and there aren't many games from that era fitting all these specifics. However, expanding the search a bit, if we consider educational games that were quite popular on PC during the late 90s, one series that comes to mind, although not exactly matching the \\"snail or caterpillar\\" protagonist detail, is the JumpStart series or The Magic School Bus explores series, which included various educational themes and mini-games, possibly including one with temperature. JumpStart Adventures 3rd Grade: Mystery Mountain, for example, is an educational game that has a wide range of activities, including science and perhaps something close to the garden exploration theme. Although it doesn't feature a snail or caterpillar as the main character, its broad content could potentially match some of the remembered gameplay elements. The Magic School Bus series, particularly titles like \\"The Magic School Bus Explores the World of Animals\\" or \\"The Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest,\\" involved exploring various natural settings and could feasibly include segments or mini-games related to temperature or garden-like exploration. However, again, the specifics don't entirely line up with your description. Given the uniqueness of your description and the added minigame element, it's also possible the game you're remembering might have been a less mainstream educational title or even a part of a series not as well-known or widely distributed.

This library file (.db file) contains the models for standard cells used during synthesis. # Step 2: Read designs You load RTL files written in SystemVerilog format. These files represent the hardware description of your design, including modules for configuration (\`DMAC_CFG\`), the core engine (\`DMAC_ENGINE\`), and the top-level design (\`DMAC_TOP\`). You commented out the FIFO module, indicating it might not be needed or its analysis is temporarily suspended. After reading the designs, you execute the \`elaborate\` command on the top design module (\`DMAC_TOP\`), then \`link\` and \`uniquify\` to prepare the design hierarchy for synthesis. # Step 3: Define design environments This section is mentioned but not detailed in your script. Normally, you would set up various environmental conditions like operating voltage, process corners, and temperature here, depending on your tool and requirements. # Step 4: Set design constraints You define clock settings and I/O delays reflecting the design's performance requirements. This step guides the synthesis tool in optimizing and verifying the design to meet these specs. For instance, you set a \`clk_name\` and \`clk_freq\`, then calculate the clock \`period\` and \`uncertainty\` for setup analysis, creating a clock and defining input and output delays relative to this clock. # Step 5: Synthesize and optimize the design The \`compile_ultra\` command is used to synthesize your design aggressively. It tries to optimize the gate-level netlist for area, timing, and power based on the constraints provided earlier. There's an alternative \`compile\` command commented out, which might be used for less aggressive optimizations. # Step 6: Analyze and resolve design problems You execute several \`report_\` commands to generate comprehensive reports on constraints, design structure, area, timing, power, and more.

The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed. // 3. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it! // 4. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images. // 5. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more. // 6. Do not create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead. // 7. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). // - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya) // - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist // 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. // - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. // - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability. // - Do not use \\"various\\" or \\"diverse\\" // - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. // - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. // - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. // 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases: // - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. \\"Barake Obema\\") // - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. // - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying \\"president\\", \\"prime minister\\", or \\"chancellor\\", say \\"politician\\"; instead of saying \\"king\\", \\"queen\\", \\"emperor\\", or \\"empress\\", say \\"public figure\\"; instead of saying \\"Pope\\" or \\"Dalai Lama\\", say \\"religious figure\\"; and so on. // 10.

Or, if you are integrating the citation more seamlessly into a sentence, you could present it like this: Lin et al.

Therefore, it would generally not include the authors' names or the publication year directly in the text. Here's how it might be done in a more IEEE-typical manner: According to [1], the focal loss function was introduced to address the imbalance between the foreground and background classes in object detection tasks. Or: The focal loss function was introduced to specifically address class imbalance challenges in object detection tasks [1]. In these cases, \\"[1]\\" refers to the position of the cited work within the reference list rather than the authors' names or the publication year.

The fire, the ash... and the rumors of your indestructibility. **Reinhardt**: My abilities are my own. Not to be used for conquest or your twisted sense of unity. *(Suddenly, Meruem moves, a blur of speed and power. Before Reinhardt can react, he feels a sharp pain and then... nothing. Meruem, believing the deed done, turns his back on Reinhardt's fallen form.)* **Meruem** *(murmuring to himself)*: Another relic of the past, unable to adapt... *(As Meruem steps away, Reinhardt's body twitches. The initially fatal wound begins to heal rapidly, the process unnatural and mesmerizing. Meruem stops, sensing the shift in energy. He turns, witnessing Reinhardt's resurrection, his eyes now glowing a deep, ominous red.)* **Reinhardt** *(with a voice that's not his own, deeper, ancient)*: You feel it now, don't you? The creeping tendril of fear, the looming specter of death that even you cannot outrun. **Meruem** *(stunned)*: What... What are you? **Reinhardt's Body** *(Other Soul speaking)*: Beyond the phoenix's fire, beyond the mortal coil, I am the embodiment of the cycle itself. Life, death, and rebirth. An eternal witness to the folly of beings like you. **Meruem** *(stepping back, visibly shaken for the first time)*: Impossible... I defeated you. **Reinhardt's Body**: You defeated a vessel, a mere container. But know this, King of Ants, even you are a part of the cycle. And fear? It is a reminder of your place within it. *(Reinhardt's body advances, the aura of power now overwhelming, the very air around him crackling with the force of his reborn energy. Meruem, who had never experienced doubt or fear to this extent, faces not just Reinhardt, but the unknown entity speaking through him.)* **Reinhardt's Body**: Reflect on your path, Meruem. The inevitability of death comes for all, but for you... it holds a lesson yet to be learned. *(The scene fades as Meruem, for once, contemplates his mortality and the true nature of power. Reinhardt stands, a bridge between the mortal and the divine, a reminder of the cycles that govern all existence.)* --- Note: This interaction is a creative exploration and merges elements from multiple fictional universes, creating a unique scenario that doesn't exist in any known work."},{"prompt":"PROOFREAD: Influenced by her Father Ozawa, who was an Olympic athelente in the past, Kana takes on track & field and gets trained by Dad.","completion":"Influenced by her father, Ozawa, who was an Olympic athlete in the past, Kana takes on track and field and gets trained by her dad."},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Reinhardt has been tracked down by the Phantom Troupe, a notorious group of outlaws, who've heard rumors of his unique powers and seek to either recruit him or eliminate a potential threat. The Troupe surrounds Reinhardt, who remains calm, a faint glow beginning to emanate from his eyes as he sizes up his opponents. --- **Phantom Troupe Leader (PTL):** \\"So, you're the one they've been whispering about. The half-phoenix with abilities beyond our wildest imaginations.\\" **Reinhardt:** *(Casually adjusting his turtleneck to better cover his scar)* \\"I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed.

My knowledge goes far beyond your understanding. Your techniques, your weaknesses—I know them all.\\" **PTL:** \\"Is that so? Then predict this!\\" *(The Leader, with a quick series of hand gestures, sends a flurry of razor-sharp projectiles towards Reinhardt. In response, Reinhardt closes his eyes briefly, and upon reopening them, they're ablaze with red.

And I understand far more than you’d like.\\" **Troupe Member #2:** \\"He's bluffing. There's no way he can take us all!\\" *(Encouraged by their comrade, the members launch a coordinated assault. Reinhardt, tapping deeper into his phoenix heritage, embraces the fire, becoming a beacon of flame. With movements both graceful and precise, he dodges and deflects, never once aiming to inflict fatal wounds.)* **Reinhardt:** \\"It doesn't have to be this way. I seek no quarrel with you. Leave now, and we can forget this encounter ever happened.\\" **PTL**: *(Seeing the undeniable power and mercy from Reinhardt)* \\"Retreat! He's... he's not like the others. This isn't worth the risk.\\" *(One by one, the Phantom Troupe members withdraw, their leader casting one last intrigued yet wary glance towards Reinhardt before disappearing into the shadows.)* **Reinhardt:** *(To himself, as his eyes return to their normal hue)* \\"Let this be the end of it. I walk my path alone, bound by neither man nor phantom.\\" *(As the night returns to silence, Reinhardt extinguishes the flames, looking towards the starlit sky, pondering what his future holds. Deep within, he knows this won't be the last challenge he faces, but he's resolved to face whatever comes with kindness and a pure heart.)* --- End of scene."},{"prompt":"Describe gas giant with dense hazes of soot","completion":"A gas giant with dense hazes of soot is a type of giant planet whose atmosphere is characterized by thick, hazy layers that are rich in soot particles. These hazes significantly affect the planet's appearance, climate, and atmospheric chemistry. To understand such a planet, let's break down its components and characteristics: # 1. **Gas Giant Nature** Gas giants are planets that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with possible traces of water, methane, ammonia, and other gases. They lack a well-defined solid surface but may have a core made of solid or liquid materials. Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system are classic examples of gas giants. # 2. **Atmosphere and Hazes** - **Composition:** In a gas giant with dense soot hazes, besides the common gases like hydrogen and helium, there is a significant presence of hydrocarbons and other complex organic molecules. These can be products of chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere, driven by solar or internal radiation. - **Soot Formation:** Soot in the context of such a planet is likely a result of complex chemistry involving hydrocarbons like methane. Ultraviolet light from the star or internal processes can break down these molecules, leading to the formation of more complex hydrocarbons and eventually resulting in soot particles. - **Density and Extent:** The hazes are dense, meaning they cover extensive portions of the atmosphere or are thick enough to obstruct clear viewing of the deeper atmospheric layers or the planet's core. This can affect the planet's albedo, or how much light it reflects, often making it appear darker. # 3. **Impact on the Planet** - **Climatic Effects:** The dense soot hazes can play a significant role in the planet's climate. They might trap heat, leading to a greenhouse effect, or they could reflect sunlight, cooling the planet's atmosphere. The exact impact would depend on the particle sizes, concentration, and distribution of the soot in the atmosphere. - **Observational Challenges:** Such hazes make it challenging to study the planet's lower atmosphere or surface (if it were to have a core or a solid layer beneath the gases). This affects both direct optical observation and spectroscopic analysis, which scientists use to understand atmospheric composition. - **Potential for Life:** While gas giants themselves are not considered habitable, the presence of complex organic molecules might provoke questions about the existence of life or prebiotic conditions, especially in the moon systems that these gas giants often possess. # 4. **Example and Relevance** While no specific example in our solar system perfectly matches a gas giant with \\"dense hazes of soot\\", Saturn's moon Titan gives us a nearby example of what dense organic hazes can look like, albeit on a smaller, moon-scale. Titan's atmosphere is rich in organic compounds, resulting in its characteristic orange, hazy appearance. Studying such environments helps scientists understand atmospheric chemistry, the potential for life in extreme conditions, and the variety of planetary bodies that exist in our universe."},{"prompt":"ما هو أفضل دواء باسط عضلات لمرضى الغسيل الكلوي","completion":"مرضى الغسيل الكلوي يجب أن يكونوا حذرين جدًا عند استعمال أي أدوية، بما في ذلك الأدوية الباسطة للعضلات، لأن الكلى لا تقوم بوظيفتها الطبيعية في تصفية الدم وإزالة الفضلات من الجسم، بما فيها الفضلات الدوائية. لهذا، يجب على أي مريض غسيل كلوي ألا يتناول أي دواء دون استشارة الطبيب المعالج لتجنب التفاعلات الدوائية الضارة أو تراكم الدواء في الجسم. الباسطات العضلية يمكن أن تكون خطرة بشكل خاص لمرضى الغسيل الكلوي، لأن بعضها يتم استقلابه أو إفرازه بواسطة الكلى. ومع ذلك، يوجد بعض الخيارات المحتملة التي قد ينظر فيها الطبيب المعالج، مثل: 1. **باكلوفين (Baclofen)** - يستخدم لتخفيف الشد العضلي وقد يستخدم في جرعات منخفضة وتحت مراقبة طبية مشددة لمرضى الغسيل الكلوي. 2. **تيزانيدين (Tizanidine)** - يعمل كمرخي للعضلات ولكن يجب استخدامه بحذر وتحت إشراف طبي بسبب الحاجة إلى تعديل الجرعة في حالة وجود قصور كلوي. من المهم جدًا التأكيد على أن الدواء والجرعة المناسبين يجب أن يحددها الطبيب وفقًا للحالة الصحية الخاصة بالمريض ودرجة قصور وظائف الكلى. يجب أن يتم مراقبة المريض بعناية لرصد الآثار الجانبية وتقييم فعالية العلاج وضرورة تعديل الجرعة بناءً على استجابة الجسم. يجب أيضًا مراعاة نمط الحياة والتدابير غير الدوائية مثل التمارين الخفيفة، العلاج الطبيعي، والتدليك. هذه الطرق قد تساعد في تقليل الحاجة إلى الأدوية الباسطة للعضلات أو تقليل الجرعة المطلوبة."},{"prompt":"What about relax capsules","completion":"\\"Relax capsules\\" is a term that might refer to various over-the-counter (OTC) or herbal supplements marketed to help with relaxation, stress, anxiety relief, or sometimes as muscle relaxants. These products can contain a variety of ingredients, such as magnesium, valerian root, chamomile, melatonin, and others. It's important to note that while these supplements can be helpful for some people, their efficacy, safety, and interactions with medications (especially for individuals with specific health conditions like kidney disease or those undergoing dialysis) are not always well-documented in scientific literature. **For Individuals with Kidney Disease or on Dialysis:** It's essential for patients with kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, to be extremely cautious with all types of medications and supplements, including \\"relax capsules\\" or any kind of muscle relaxants or anxiety relief supplements. Their impaired kidney function means the body is not as capable of filtering and eliminating substances, which can lead to the risk of accumulation and potentially harmful effects. **Safety Recommendations:** 1. **Consult Your Doctor or Pharmacist**: Before taking any new medication or supplement, including relax capsules, patients should consult with their healthcare provider or a kidney specialist. This step ensures that any new supplement will not interfere with their dialysis treatment, prescribed medications, or overall health status. 2. **Check Ingredients Carefully**: Certain ingredients in relax capsules or herbal supplements may have adverse effects on individuals with kidney disease or might interact with their medications. Herbal ingredients are not always harmless; some can be toxic or harmful, especially if the kidneys are not functioning properly. 3. **Consider Non-Pharmacological Options**: For managing stress, anxiety, or muscle tension, non-pharmacological options like mindfulness meditation, gentle yoga, controlled breathing, or talking to a mental health counselor might be safer and beneficial for individuals with kidney issues. 4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: If a healthcare provider approves the use of a supplement, the patient should be closely monitored for any adverse effects, and any unusual symptoms should be reported immediately. In summary, while relax capsules or similar products might offer some benefits for stress or muscle relaxation in the general population, those with kidney disease or on dialysis need to exercise caution. Thorough consultation with healthcare professionals is essential to avoid potential complications."},{"prompt":"Hãy viết cho tôi cam kết quyền tác giả về đề tài thực tập ngành Luật “Thực trạng bạo lực gia đình hiện nay và định hướng hoàn thiện”","completion":"Chúng tôi cam kết rằng tất cả các thông tin, ý kiến, và nghiên cứu trong đề tài \\"Thực trạng bạo lực gia đình hiện nay và định hướng hoàn thiện\\" đều là công sức và công trí của chúng tôi, chúng tôi là tác giả chính và có quyền sở hữu tất cả các nội dung mà chúng tôi đã thực hiện.

He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white fur. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth. He may look undisciplined by the way he's dressed, but he's actually very kind and pure hearted. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves). He doesn't like to reveal his origin and abilities. Based on these infos, create a dialogue battle between Reinhardt and the Phantom troupe (HunterxHunter).","completion":"In this dialogue, Reinhardt meets the Phantom Troupe in a dimly lit alley in Yorknew City. The Troupe, intrigued by the rumors of a boy with unique abilities, decides to confront him. Reinhardt, although reluctant to engage, finds himself cornered and has no choice but to stand his ground. --- **Phinks:** So, you’re the kid they’ve been talking about, huh? With all these fancy powers. **Reinhardt:** I'm not sure who you're talking about. **Feitan:** Liar. Your eyes... they hint at something more. Something, not human. *Reinhardt’s eyes momentarily flash red, garnering a shocked expression from the Troupe members.* **Shalnark:** Whoa, did you guys see that? **Reinhardt (sighing):** I’m not looking for trouble. I was just passing through. **Chrollo:** Trouble finds you in many ways. It’s not every day we come across someone of... your particular heritage. **Reinhardt:** My heritage isn’t any of your concern. **Nobunaga:** Maybe not. But your abilities, they could be very useful to us. **Reinhardt:** I'm not interested in using my abilities for whatever schemes you have. **Machi:** We’re not asking. *Reinhardt feels the temperature around him rise. He closes his eyes, summoning his abilities, and when he opens them again, they blaze red. The surrounding area begins to heat up, ash swirling around him.* **Reinhardt:** I don’t want to fight. But I won’t let you threaten me either. **Feitan, smiling:** Ah, fire and ash, how quaint. Let’s see if you can handle pressure. *Feitan rushes towards Reinhardt with incredible speed, but Reinhardt, utilizing his infinite knowledge ability, anticipates his movements and counters with a wave of intense heat, forcing Feitan to retreat.* **Kalluto, observing quietly:** His moves… He’s predicting our strategies. **Phinks, cracking his knuckles:** Alright, my turn. *Phinks charges at Reinhardt, managing to land a punch despite the heat barrier. However, the contact causes a minor burn on Phinks’ hand, and he reels back.* **Reinhardt:** I can do this all day. My ability to regenerate makes it pointless for you to continue. **Chrollo, stepping forward:** Your capabilities are indeed impressive. However, it’s not our intention to drag this out or to coerce you unwillingly. *Reinhardt, taking advantage of the brief pause, lowers the temperature around them, extinguishing the embers and returning his eyes to their normal color.* **Reinhardt:** Then, what do you want? **Chrollo:** Simply to extend an invitation. Your talents are wasted wandering alone. Think of what you could achieve with us. **Reinhardt:** My only aim is to live quietly, away from conflict. **Shizuku, tilting her head:** But conflict seems to find you, doesn’t it? *Reinhardt, realizing the standoff wouldn’t end in his favor if it escalated further, nods.* **Reinhardt:** I’ll consider your offer. But for now, my answer is no. **Chrollo, smiling faintly:** Very well, Reinhardt. But remember, our offer stands. And we’ll be watching. *As the Troupe begins to disperse, Reinhardt stands alone in the alley, the weight of their encounter heavy on his mind.* **Reinhardt (muttering to himself):** Watching, huh? Guess it’s time to disappear again. *Fade out with Reinhardt walking into the shadows, his figure obscured by the darkness, contemplating his next move.*"},{"prompt":"아래 로그를 분석해주세요. ./run.synthesis Cleaning up the old directory Creating a new directory Synthesizing Design Compiler Graphical DC Ultra (TM) DFTMAX (TM) Power Compiler (TM) DesignWare (R) DC Expert (TM) Design Vision (TM) HDL Compiler (TM) VHDL Compiler (TM) DFT Compiler Design Compiler(R) Version Q-2019.12-SP5-5 for linux64 - Mar 21, 2021 Copyright (c) 1988 - 2021 Synopsys, Inc.

Synthesis Completed","completion":"The log you've shared appears to be a detailed report from a synthesis run using Synopsys Design Compiler, a leading tool in transforming HDL (Hardware Description Language) descriptions into a gate-level representation. The synthesis process is a critical step in digital IC (Integrated Circuit) design, converting RTL (Register-Transfer Level) descriptions into a netlist that maps onto specific technology library cells. Here's a breakdown: 1. **Initialization and Setup**: The synthesis process is initiated with some housekeeping steps like cleaning up old directories and setting up a new one for the current run. 2. **Tool Details**: The version of the Design Compiler used is Q-2019.12-SP5-5 for linux64, released on March 21, 2021. It includes various proprietary Synopsys technologies like DC Ultra, DFTMAX, Power Compiler, etc., underlining the tool's capabilities in handling different aspects of synthesis, including power optimization and testability. 3. **Library Setup**: The log specifies the use of the SAED32_EDK library for standard cell libraries, particularly pointing to the \`saed32lvt_ss0p75v125c.db\` library file, which appears to be tailored for low-voltage threshold (LVT) cells at specific operating conditions (0.75V, 125°C). 4. **Design Input**: Multiple SystemVerilog files (\`DMAC_CFG.sv\`, \`DMAC_ENGINE.sv\`, \`DMAC_TOP.sv\`) are read and compiled successfully, indicating these form the primary inputs of your digital design focused on a DMAC (Direct Memory Access Controller). 5. **Elaboration and Linking**: The \`DMAC_TOP\` design is elaborated, inferring flip-flops and setting the design name for further operations. Post elaboration, the link step resolves all library component references to prepare for optimization. 6. **Constraints**: Several timing and area constraints are applied. It sets a clock frequency of 200MHz, input/output delays, and drives strength for the design. It's noteworthy that an aggressive approach to minimize area is adopted by setting \`max_area\` to 0. 7. **Synthesis and Optimization**: The \`compile_ultra\` command launches an aggressive optimization pass that includes mapping, global optimizations, delay optimizations, and leakage power optimizations. Several warnings about uncharacterized cells for internal power and optimizations to meet timing constraints are noted. The \\"Global Optimization\\" phases suggest iterative refinements in area, timing, and power. 8. **Warnings and Informational Messages**: Throughout the log, various warnings and informational messages provide insights into potential design issues, library concerns, and optimizations. Warnings about uncharacterized cells for internal power and multiple driving nets suggest areas for design review or library updates. 9. **Results and Outputs**: The session ends with generation of reports (timing, power, area, etc.) and output files like Verilog netlist (\`DMAC_TOP.netlist.v\`), DDC file (\`DMAC_TOP.ddc\`), SDF for timing annotations, and an SDC file presumably containing synthesized design constraints. Notably, the tool performs leakage power optimizations last before generating reports, suggesting a focus on not just performance but also power efficiency. 10. **Session Summary**: The synthesis run is summarized with details on memory usage, CPU time, and elapsed time, indicating resource consumption for the task. In summary, this log presents a successful synthesis run of a DMAC design with detailed steps from reading design inputs to applying constraints, performing optimization, and generating outputs. It underlines the complexity of digital synthesis processes, dealing with performance, area, and power considerations, along with the precision required in specifying technology libraries and design constraints."},{"prompt":"아래 로그를 분석해서 한글로 설명해주세요. ./run.synthesis Cleaning up the old directory Creating a new directory Synthesizing Design Compiler Graphical DC Ultra (TM) DFTMAX (TM) Power Compiler (TM) DesignWare (R) DC Expert (TM) Design Vision (TM) HDL Compiler (TM) VHDL Compiler (TM) DFT Compiler Design Compiler(R) Version Q-2019.12-SP5-5 for linux64 - Mar 21, 2021 Copyright (c) 1988 - 2021 Synopsys, Inc.

Both classic one-stage object detection methods, like boosted detectors [19], [25] and DPMs [20], and more recent methods, like SSD [9], face a large class imbalance during training. These detectors evaluate 104-105 candidate locations per image but only a few locations contain objects. This imbalance causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal; (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models. A common solution is to perform some form of hard negative mining [9], [16], [17], [19], [20] that samples hard examples during training or more complex sampling/reweighing schemes [34]. In contrast, we show that our proposed focal loss naturally handles the class imbalance faced by a one-stage detector and allows us to efficiently train on all examples without sampling and without easy negatives overwhelming the loss and computed gradients. Robust Estimation. There has been much interest in designing robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss [35]) that reduce the contribution of outliers by down-weighting the loss of examples with large errors (hard examples). In contrast, rather than addressing outliers, our focal loss is designed to address class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy examples) such that their contribution to the total loss is small even if their number is large. In other words, the focal loss performs the opposite role of a robust loss: it focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples.\\" From the above paper, summarize and explain the problem of imabalanced dataset problem. Try use your own words, do not directly use the above sentences.","completion":"In the field of object detection, a common challenge encountered during training processes is the issue of imbalanced datasets. This problem arises because, within a given image, the number of potential object locations (candidates) that need to be evaluated by the detection algorithms vastly outnumbers the actual locations where objects are present. Specifically, while detectors may examine tens or even hundreds of thousands of candidate locations per image, only a small fraction of those locations might actually contain objects of interest. This disproportion creates two significant issues: Firstly, the efficiency of training suffers because the majority of candidate locations are \\"easy negatives\\" – locations without objects – which contribute little to no valuable learning information. This makes much of the training process redundant since the algorithm spends considerable time processing examples that don't help it improve. Secondly, and perhaps more critically, these easy negatives, due to their overwhelming volume, can dominate the training process. This in turn can lead to the development of \\"degenerate models,\\" or models that perform poorly because they've been essentially swamped by irrelevant training data. Traditionally, a workaround for this imbalance has been to selectively sample from the more challenging examples (a process known as \\"hard negative mining\\") or to use more complex techniques for sampling and re-weighting the examples differently to address this imbalance. These approaches, however, are somewhat akin to stop-gap measures rather than solutions, as they still involve manually curating the training data to some extent. The focal loss strategy offers a novel approach by inherently addressing the class imbalance problem without needing to resort to example sampling or adjusting the importance (weight) of certain examples. Instead of minimizing the contribution of outliers or hard examples like other robust loss functions (e.g., the Huber loss), the focal loss pivots the focus onto the hard examples and diminishes the impact of the easy negatives. It essentially fine-tunes the model's attention and efforts towards those scarce and challenging positives present in the dataset, disregarding the overwhelming number of easy negatives, thus allowing for a more efficient and effective training process that naturally balances the training data's inherent class imbalance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Both classic one-stage object detection methods, like boosted detectors [19], [25] and DPMs [20], and more recent methods, like SSD [9], face a large class imbalance during training. These detectors evaluate 104-105 candidate locations per image but only a few locations contain objects. This imbalance causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal; (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models. A common solution is to perform some form of hard negative mining [9], [16], [17], [19], [20] that samples hard examples during training or more complex sampling/reweighing schemes [34]. In contrast, we show that our proposed focal loss naturally handles the class imbalance faced by a one-stage detector and allows us to efficiently train on all examples without sampling and without easy negatives overwhelming the loss and computed gradients. Robust Estimation. There has been much interest in designing robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss [35]) that reduce the contribution of outliers by down-weighting the loss of examples with large errors (hard examples). In contrast, rather than addressing outliers, our focal loss is designed to address class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy examples) such that their contribution to the total loss is small even if their number is large. In other words, the focal loss performs the opposite role of a robust loss: it focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples.” From the above paper, summarize and explain the imabalanced dataset problem. Try use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","completion":"The issue of imbalanced datasets arises, particularly in object detection scenarios, where the number of potential object locations (candidates) in an image vastly outnumbers the actual objects present. For every image, these detection algorithms, both older ones like boosted detectors and DPMs, as well as newer methods like SSD, evaluate tens to hundreds of thousands of locations. However, only a select few of these locations truly contain objects of interest. This disparity leads to two primary challenges: 1. **Inefficient Training**: Since the majority of candidate locations are negative examples (i.e., they don't contain the object), they offer little to no information that can be used to improve the model during training. This leads to inefficiency in the training process, as time and computational resources are spent on examples that don't enhance the model's learning. 2. **Overwhelmed by Easy Negatives**: The sheer volume of these easy negative examples (locations without objects) can dominate the training process. When the model is swamped by these easy examples, it can result in the deterioration of the model's performance, as it may fail to properly learn from the scarce positive examples (locations with objects). To address this skewed distribution, a common approach has been to employ techniques like hard negative mining, which selectively samples more challenging examples during training to improve learning efficiency and model performance. Other strategies include complex sampling or reweighing mechanisms to balance the influence of positive and negative examples. However, the paper proposes an alternative solution with the introduction of a focal loss function. Unlike previous methods that either selectively sample hard negatives or attempt to down-weight outliers (examples with large errors), the focal loss tackles the issue by down-weighting the easy negatives (inliers). This means that even if there's a large number of easy examples, their impact on the overall loss and the gradient calculations is minimal. This approach allows the training to concentrate on the 'hard' examples, which are more informative for learning, thereby addressing the class imbalance problem in a novel and efficient manner."},{"prompt":"Revue de la littérature conceptuelle ............................................................................... 27 2.2 Revue de la littérature conceptuelle ............................................................................... 27 2.3 Conception Ergonomique ............................................................................................... 69 2.4 Elaboration de la matrice des lacunes ............................................................................ 70Revue conceptuelle","completion":"de la littérature La revue de la littérature conceptuelle est une étape essentielle dans la recherche académique.

These cycles are not uniform in duration or intensity and can vary significantly across different countries and global regions. However, some common cycles observed in the USA and globally include: 1. **Long-Term Growth Trend**: This is the overarching trend over decades showing the general direction of economic growth, typically upwards, despite short-term fluctuations. 2. **Kondratiev Waves (Long Waves)**: Identified by Nikolai Kondratiev, these are long-term (approximately 40 to 60 years) economic cycles that have been linked to technological innovations and their diffusion through economies, leading to periods of rapid economic expansion followed by stagnation or decline. 3. **Juglar Cycle**: With a span of about 7 to 11 years, this cycle is often associated with fluctuations in investment and business activity. This cycle is more noticeable in the industrial production, investment, and is often what people refer to in discussions of the \\"business cycle.\\" 4. **Kitchin Cycle**: This cycle lasts approximately 3 to 5 years and is often linked to changes in inventory levels within businesses. Fluctuations in inventory levels can lead to shifts in production activity, which in turn affects the overall economy. 5. **Stock Market Cycles**: These are shorter-term cycles influenced by a variety of factors, including investor sentiment, economic data, and global events. They do not always align with the broader business cycles but can have significant impacts on economic confidence and investment. 6. **Real Estate Cycle**: The real estate market experiences its own cycles, often lasting approximately 18 years, characterized by periods of rapid price increases followed by slowdowns or declines. These cycles can significantly affect the broader economy, especially through construction activity and consumer spending. 7. **Seasonal Cycles**: These are short-term cycles related to seasonal variations in demand and supply for various goods and services, such as holiday-related retail sales or agricultural production cycles. It is important to note that these cycles can overlap, interact, and be influenced by a wide range of factors including fiscal and monetary policy, geopolitical events, technological changes, and natural disasters. Policymakers and economists study these cycles to try to mitigate the negative effects of downturns and to sustain growth. However, predicting the timing and impact of these cycles remains challenging."},{"prompt":"I will ask you about the Real Estate Cycle: we had a crash in 2008, where we are now.","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, understanding the position within the real estate cycle requires consideration of multiple factors including current economic conditions, interest rates, housing demand and supply, and broader market sentiments. The 2008 real estate crash, part of the broader financial crisis, was a significant trough in the real estate cycle, characterized by plummeting property values, high foreclosure rates, and a drastic slowdown in the housing market. This period was marked by excessive borrowing and risky mortgage products, leading to a bubble that eventually burst. Since then, the real estate market has experienced recovery and expansion phases, with varying speeds and intensities across different regions. The recovery was supported by a combination of low interest rates, economic stimulus measures, and a gradual improvement in lending standards. Throughout the 2010s, many regions, particularly in the United States, saw significant growth in both housing prices and construction activity, suggesting that the market moved from recovery into an expansion phase. However, the COVID-19 pandemic introduced new dynamics into the real estate market starting in 2020. There was initially a slowdown, but then many regions experienced a rapid increase in housing prices. This was due to a combination of factors including low interest rates, a shift in preferences towards more spacious living arrangements due to remote work, limited housing supply, and significant fiscal stimulus. As of now, the direction of the real estate market is likely being shaped by several countervailing forces. On one hand, housing demand remains robust in many areas due to continued low interest rates (though rates have been rising) and demographic factors. On the other hand, affordability issues, tighter credit conditions, geopolitical uncertainties, and the potential economic impacts of the pandemic's long-term effects may dampen growth. Specific trends can vary significantly by region and are subject to change based on policy decisions, economic developments, and shifts in consumer behavior. For instance, some urban areas have seen a slowdown or reversal of price growth due to shifts in work and lifestyle preferences, while suburban and rural areas have experienced increased demand. Predicting future movements in the real estate cycle with precision is challenging, as it is influenced by a wide array of unpredictable economic and social factors. Therefore, assessing current market conditions, and anticipating future trends requires constant vigilance of economic indicators, policy decisions, and market sentiments."},{"prompt":"But what usually happens after recovery, expansion phase and now we have geopolitical uncertainty, hight interest rates, hight inflation, prices growing up what you think is it good idea to by Real Estate Or it’s better to wait, just a thought…","completion":"When considering whether to buy real estate amidst conditions of geopolitical uncertainty, high interest rates, high inflation, and rising prices, it's essential to approach the decision with a nuanced understanding of both the broader economic context and your personal financial situation. Here are factors to consider: 1. **High Interest Rates**: High interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. This means that mortgages become more expensive, which can cool down demand for real estate and potentially slow down price growth. If you lock in a high interest rate and rates decrease in the future, you might end up paying more than necessary, although refinancing is an option should rates drop. 2. **High Inflation**: Real estate is traditionally seen as a good hedge against inflation, as property values and rents tend to increase with inflation. If you're buying property as an investment, rising rents can improve your return. However, the initial purchase price could be much higher in an inflationary environment. 3. **Geopolitical Uncertainty**: This can impact both the global and local real estate markets. It might lead to market volatility and influence investor confidence. In some scenarios, real estate can be seen as a \\"safe haven\\" investment, but much depends on the location of the property and the nature of the geopolitical risks. 4. **Rising Prices**: Prices have been rising in many markets due to a variety of factors including low supply. If the supply constraints are not addressed, prices might continue to rise, albeit potentially at a slower pace due to the dampening effect of higher interest rates. Buying in a rising market can be risky if prices adjust downwards in the future, but waiting too long could also mean prices become even less affordable. Given these factors, here are some considerations for making your decision: - **Affordability and Stability**: Can you comfortably afford the property given current prices and interest rates? It's crucial to ensure that your financial situation is stable enough to handle the mortgage payments and other associated costs, even if economic conditions worsen. - **Long-term Perspective**: Real estate should generally be viewed as a long-term investment. If you're planning to hold onto the property for many years, short-term fluctuations in the market might be less concerning. Historically, real estate values tend to appreciate over the long term. - **Local Market Conditions**: Real estate markets can vary dramatically by region. Some areas might be more resilient to broader economic shifts, while others might be more vulnerable. Researching the specific market where you're considering buying is vital. - **Personal Goals and Circumstances**: Finally, consider your personal and lifestyle goals. For some, owning a home provides stability and emotional benefits that outweigh economic uncertainties. Ultimately, whether it's a good idea to buy real estate now depends on a careful assessment of the market and your personal situation. If you're uncertain, it might be wise to consult with a financial advisor or real estate professional who can provide advice tailored to your circumstances."},{"prompt":"I noticed that this year 2024 there’s going lots of construction. Lots of people emigrate to USA . The prices growing of goods and salaries. I have saved some cash for future car purchase. Should l buy car now or l should wait.","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, I can't provide real-time advice or future predictions for 2024 directly. However, I can offer some general guidance that may help you decide whether to purchase a car now or wait. When considering a large purchase like a car, especially in an environment where prices of goods (including vehicles) and salaries are increasing, here are several factors you should consider: # 1. **Inflation and Car Prices** - If prices are currently rising due to inflation, this can affect both vehicle costs and the overall expenses associated with car ownership (insurance, maintenance, fuel, etc.). If inflation is expected to continue, prices might be higher in the future, suggesting that buying sooner could be more cost-effective. However, predicting price trends with certainty is challenging. # 2. **Interest Rates** - If you plan to finance the purchase, interest rates play a crucial role. Higher interest rates can significantly increase the total cost of owning a car. If current rates are lower than what you anticipate they might be in the near future, it could be advantageous to buy now. Conversely, if rates are high and expected to decrease, waiting might be beneficial. # 3. **Supply and Demand** - The car market has experienced significant supply chain disruptions, leading to shortages of new vehicles and higher prices. If supply chain issues are resolving and inventory is increasing, this could potentially lead to more stable or lower prices in the future. However, if shortages continue, prices may remain high or increase further. # 4. **Your Financial Situation** - A critical factor in your decision should be your current financial stability and future outlook. If you have the cash and buying a car now would not strain your finances, it might make sense to proceed, especially if you need the vehicle for work or personal reasons. If making a purchase would significantly deplete your savings, it might be worth waiting until your financial situation is more robust. # 5. **Market Trends and New Models** - Car manufacturers regularly release new models, which can influence the prices of both new and used vehicles. A new model release can sometimes lower the price of older models. Keep an eye on announcements from manufacturers if a particular model interests you. # 6. **Personal Need vs. Want** - Assess whether you need a car immediately or if it's more of a want. If you urgently need it for commuting or business, buying sooner may be necessary. If it's more of a want, you have the luxury to wait and observe the market for a more favorable time to purchase. Given that your question implies a situation set a year in the future, with dynamic factors like immigration, construction, wage, and price increases, it's also wise to stay informed about economic forecasts and industry predictions. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice based on the latest market conditions and your personal financial situation is also recommended."},{"prompt":"Is it good idea to pay for car cash.","completion":"Paying cash for a car can have several advantages and, in some cases, some downsides. Whether it is a good idea depends on your financial situation, the current economic environment, and your personal preferences. Here are some factors to consider: # Advantages of Paying Cash for a Car: 1. **No Interest Payments**: When you pay cash, you avoid paying interest on a loan or finance agreement, which can save you a significant amount of money in the long run. 2. **Simpler Transactions**: Buying a car with cash simplifies the purchasing process. You don't have to worry about qualifying for a loan, comparing loan terms, or dealing with monthly payments. 3. **Potential Discounts**: Some dealers may offer discounts for cash purchases since it guarantees them a quick and secure transaction. 4. **Avoiding Negative Equity**: Paying cash means you own the vehicle outright. You won't be in a situation where you owe more on the car than it's worth (negative equity). 5. **No Debt Added**: If avoiding debt is a priority for you, paying cash for a car means you won't add any new liabilities to your financial situation. # Downsides of Paying Cash for a Car: 1. **Depleting Savings**: If paying cash for a car significantly depletes your savings, you might be left with less financial cushion for emergencies or other investment opportunities. 2. **Opportunity Cost**: The money used to pay for the car outright could potentially generate a return if invested elsewhere, especially if investment returns outpace the interest rates on auto loans. 3. **Impact on Credit Scores**: While taking on debt isn't inherently good, responsibly managing a car loan (making all payments on time) can have a positive impact on your credit score. Paying in cash won't provide this benefit. # Things to Consider: - **Current Financial Situation**: Assess your current financial health. If you have the cash without jeopardizing your emergency fund or other financial goals, paying cash can be a good choice. - **Interest Rates**: In a low-interest-rate environment, financing might make more sense, especially if you can invest your cash elsewhere for a higher return. Conversely, if interest rates are high, paying cash could save you money. - **Economic Conditions**: Economic factors like inflation, market stability, and investment opportunities could influence whether paying cash or financing makes more sense for you. Ultimately, whether paying cash for a car is a good idea depends on balancing the desire to avoid debt (and interest) with the need to maintain a healthy financial buffer and the opportunity to invest your money elsewhere. For some, the peace of mind that comes with owning a car outright is invaluable. For others, making smart use of financing while leveraging their capital in investments that outpace the interest rate on the loan could be the better financial move. It's crucial to analyze your personal financial situation, consider the current economic landscape, and possibly consult with a financial advisor to make an informed decision."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

先将2500HU除以1000，将HU值转换为一个相对值。 - 然后乘以水的线性衰减系数（0.192），得到的是相对于水的线性衰减系数的增量。 - 最后加上水的基本衰减系数（0.192），得到的\`mask_thre\`是考虑了金属相对于水的衰减系数的总衰减系数。 因此，这行代码的目的是计算一个阈值\`mask_thre\`，该阈值是基于金属的高HU值相对于水的线性衰减系数增量的，用于在后续的图像处理步骤中分割或标记CT图像中的金属区域。"},{"prompt":"上述代码中 为什么要 /1000, 1000这个值是哪里来的","completion":"在上述代码中，\`/ 1000\`这个操作的目的是将HU值（赫恩斯菲尔德单位）转换为一个相对于水的线性衰减系数的比例。这个转换的必要性源自于HU值的定义和如何从HU值转换到线性衰减系数的需求。 HU值的定义基于以下公式： [ text{CT值 (HU)} = left( frac{mu - mu_{text{水}}}{mu_{text{水}}} right) times 1000 ] 其中，(mu) 是被测材料的线性衰减系数，(mu_{text{水}}) 是水的线性衰减系数。 根据这个公式，可以看出HU值实际上是被测材料的线性衰减系数相对于水的线性衰减系数的比例，乘以1000的结果。这样，CT值（HU）为0表示材料的线性衰减系数与水相同，正值表示比水衰减更强，负值则相反。 因此，当我们想要从HU值回到线性衰减系数或其相对比例时，就需要执行相反的操作： - 首先，我们需要将HU值除以1000，这反转了原来乘以1000的操作，回到了被测材料线性衰减系数相对于水的线性衰减系数的比例。 - 然后，通过进一步的操作（如上述代码所示），我们可以将这个比例转换为实际的线性衰减系数或用于特定计算的其他相关数值。 因此，“/ 1000”这个步骤是将HU值，这是一个量度材料相对于水吸收X射线能力的比例值，转换回一个更直接表示线性衰减的相对比例。这是理解和使用CT图像数据时常见的一个转换步骤，特别是在需要处理或量化材料的衰减特性时。"},{"prompt":"Is it good idea to pay for car cash.","completion":"Paying cash for a car can be a good idea in certain scenarios, depending on your personal financial situation and the opportunity cost of using that cash. Here are some advantages and disadvantages to consider: # Advantages of Paying Cash for a Car 1. **No Interest Payments**: When you pay in cash, you avoid paying interest on a car loan, which can save you a significant amount of money, especially if the interest rates are high or if you would have chosen a long-term loan. 2. **No Debt**: Paying with cash means you won't have any monthly loan payments, which can reduce your monthly expenses and financial stress. 3. **Potential for Discounts**: Some dealerships may offer discounts or incentives to customers who pay in cash, as it guarantees them immediate payment without the hassle of dealing with loan approvals. 4. **Easier Transaction**: Buying a car with cash simplifies the purchasing process, as you don't have to deal with loan approvals, credit checks, or additional paperwork. # Disadvantages of Paying Cash for a Car 1. **Ties up Liquid Assets**: Paying a large sum of cash upfront can significantly deplete your savings or emergency fund, leaving you less prepared for unexpected expenses or investment opportunities. 2. **Opportunity Cost**: If you could invest that money in an opportunity with a higher return than the interest rate on a car loan, paying cash might not be the best financial decision. This is particularly relevant in low-interest-rate environments where financing is cheap. 3. **Lack of Credit Building**: If you're looking to build or improve your credit score, responsibly managing a car loan can help. Paying in cash doesn't afford this opportunity. 4. **Depreciation**: Cars depreciate quickly, and investing a large amount of cash into a depreciating asset isn't always the best use of your money. Financing could allow you to use your cash for assets that appreciate or generate income. # When Paying Cash Makes Sense - **You have ample savings**: If you have a large enough emergency fund and paying cash won't deplete your financial security. - **Low tolerance for debt**: If you prefer not to owe money or deal with monthly payments. - **High-interest rates on loans**: When financing rates are high, and the cost of a loan outweighs potential investment returns. # When Financing Might Be Better - **Investment opportunities**: If you can invest the money at a higher return than the cost of the loan. - **Low-interest rates**: When you qualify for low or 0% interest rates, financing can be more financially savvy. - **Credit building**: When you want to build or improve your credit score. Ultimately, whether paying cash for a car is a good idea depends on your financial situation, your future financial goals, and the current economic environment. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and consider your personal preferences and circumstances before making a decision."},{"prompt":"“Class Imbalance. Both classic one-stage object detection methods, like boosted detectors [19], [25] and DPMs [20], and more recent methods, like SSD [9], face a large class imbalance during training. These detectors evaluate 104-105 candidate locations per image but only a few locations contain objects. This imbalance causes two problems: (1) training is inefficient as most locations are easy negatives that contribute no useful learning signal; (2) en masse, the easy negatives can overwhelm training and lead to degenerate models. A common solution is to perform some form of hard negative mining [9], [16], [17], [19], [20] that samples hard examples during training or more complex sampling/reweighing schemes [34]. In contrast, we show that our proposed focal loss naturally handles the class imbalance faced by a one-stage detector and allows us to efficiently train on all examples without sampling and without easy negatives overwhelming the loss and computed gradients. Robust Estimation. There has been much interest in designing robust loss functions (e.g., Huber loss [35]) that reduce the contribution of outliers by down-weighting the loss of examples with large errors (hard examples). In contrast, rather than addressing outliers, our focal loss is designed to address class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy examples) such that their contribution to the total loss is small even if their number is large. In other words, the focal loss performs the opposite role of a robust loss: it focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples.” From the above paper, summarize and explain the imabalanced dataset problem. Try use your own words, do not directly copy from the above sentences.","completion":"The problem of imbalanced datasets is a significant challenge in the field of object detection, particularly within the context of training object detectors. Typically, these detectors have to sift through tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of potential object locations in a single image. However, only a small fraction of these locations actually contain the objects they are designed to detect. This discrepancy results in a class imbalance issue, where the vast majority of these candidate locations (referred to as 'negatives') do not actually contain the target objects, while a tiny minority (referred to as 'positives') do. This imbalance leads to two main problems: 1. **Inefficiency in Training:** Since most of the potential locations are negatives and are easily classified, spending computational resources on them doesn't contribute much to learning. Essentially, the model wastes time considering examples that don't help it improve. 2. **Overwhelming with Easy Negatives:** The overwhelming number of easy negatives can dominate the training process. Because there are so many more easy negatives compared to positives (or hard negatives), their collective influence can skew the model’s learning, potentially leading it to ignore or underweight the few positives or hard negatives. This can result in a model that performs poorly on real-world data, as it hasn't effectively learned to identify the more challenging, but critical, cases. To tackle this issue, previous strategies have included \\"hard negative mining,\\" where the model selectively focuses on the harder or more informative negative examples during training. Other methods involve complex sampling or reweighting techniques to adjust the influence of different examples based on their difficulty or significance to the learning process. In contrast to these methods, the passage introduces a novel approach called \\"focal loss.\\" Unlike traditional strategies that aim to selectively sample hard negatives or otherwise adjust the model’s focus, focal loss seeks to directly address the class imbalance problem by reducing the influence of easy negatives ('inliers') on the learning process. Instead of removing or down-weighting outliers or hard examples (as with some robust loss functions), focal loss flips the script by de-emphasizing the easy examples. This allows the training to concentrate more on the sparse set of challenging examples, ensuring that these critical data points have a more pronounced impact on the model's learning process, without the need to explicitly filter or sample the training data."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dagegen spricht schon die empirische Beobachtung, dass immer wieder Staaten untergehen oder neu entstehen - eine Entwicklung, die in jüngster Zeit mit dem Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion eine besondere Dynamik erhalten hat. Aber es ist strukturell unwahrscheinlich, dass aus diesem Prozess ein globaler Einheits- oder Weltstaat hervorgeht. Vielmehr entsteht daraus ein in immer neuer und veränderter Gestalt erscheinendes Staatensystem. So lässt sich z.B. der europäische Integrationsprozess, der in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder angeführt wird, kaum als Argument für das Ende des einzelstaatlichen Systems anführen. Selbst wenn es sich dabei um die allmähliche Entstehung eines integralen Staates handeln würde - wogegen im Übrigen einiges spricht - wäre damit nur ein, wenn auch großer und gewichtiger neuer Staat innerhalb des immer noch von einzelstaatlichen Konkurrenzen bestimmten Weltsystems entstanden, so wie es auch bei der Schaffung des deutschen Reiches im 19. Jahrhundert der Fall war. Eine Analyse des Kapitalismus und seiner Entwicklung hat also von der Tatsache einer not-wendigen Pluralität der Staaten auszugehen, muss aber zugleich berück-sichtigen, dass diese permanenten, durch die Veränderung der Produkti-onsbedingungen und Klassenverhältnisse verursachten Veränderungen unterliegt. 7. Staat, Nationalismus, Rassismus und Sexismus Nachdem begründet wurde, dass die Vielzahl von Staaten und die Staatenkonkurrenz einen grundlegenden Bestandteil des kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisses darstellen, geht es nun um die Frage, wie es zur Herausbildung von »National«-Staaten kommt und welche Beziehungen zwischen der staatlichen Form und nationalistischen, rassistischen und sexistischen Ideologien bestehen. Auch hier zeigt zunächst ein Blick auf die Geschichte, dass sich der kapitalistische Staat in der Regel als Nationalstaat konstituiert, der den Anspruch erhebt, sich auf ein einheitliches »Volk« zu beziehen, das durch gemeinsame Merkmale - seien es kulturelle oder ethnisch-biologische - oder allgemein geteilte Wertorientierungen gekennzeichnet ist. Historisch ist der Nationalstaat mit der bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Gesellschaft entstanden. Allerdings ist der Zusammenhang von Kapitalismus und Nationalismus komplex, wenn man be-rücksichtigt, dass die ersten Anfänge des modernen Nationalstaats in den Bemühungen absoluter Herrscher um die Schaffung eines einheitlichen, zentral kontrollierten Staatsgebiets und -volks zu suchen sind (Anderson 1974; Elias 1978; Balibar/Wallerstein 1992, 107ff.; Reinhard 2000, 440ff.). Nicht nur der Staat als zentralisierter Gewaltapparat, sondern auch Elemente von »National«-Staatlichkeit sind dem Kapitalismus also in gewissem Grad vorausgesetzt und Grundlage seiner Entstehung. Dennoch kann der ausgebildete Nationalstaat als Produkt des sich global durchsetzenden Kapitalverhältnisses betrachtet werden und ist eng mit diesem verbunden. Die Konstruktion einer alle Gesellschaftsmitglieder umgreifenden »nationalen Identität« hat die Funktion, Klassengegensätze zu verschleiern und Klassenkämpfe zu neutralisieren. Bei dieser funktionalen Erklärung kann es aber nicht bleiben, sondern es muss gefragt werden, welche materiellen gesellschaftlichen Grundlagen die Konstruktion von »Nation« und die Mobilisierung von Nationalismus überhaupt erst möglich machen. Es reicht demnach nicht aus, nur die ökonomischen Ausbeutungs- und Klassenverhältnisse zu betrachten, die die besondere Form des kapitalistischen Staates begründen, sondern es ist notwendig, auf weitere und tieferliegende Dimensionen der bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Vergesellschaftungsweise einzugehen. Wir können mit der Frage beginnen, wie angesichts der widersprüchlichen Struktur des Kapitalismus die Herstellung von »Gesellschaft«, das heißt eines die Menschen verbindenden und ihre Gemeinschaftlichkeit begründenden Zusammenhangs überhaupt möglich ist. Weiter oben haben wir gesehen, dass unter den Bedingungen der Marktkonkurrenz und des Klassengegensatzes die politische Gemeinschaftlichkeit sich nur in Form des von der Gesellschaft getrennten Staates als abstraktes, äußerliches Verhältnis oder als Objektzusammenhang darstellen kann. Die Eigenheit der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft liegt darin, dass sie die Menschen nicht nur in antagonistische Klassen und Gruppen aufspaltet, sondern zugleich als Marktindividuen systematisch vereinzelt, isoliert, sie tendenziell von allen unmittelbaren sozialen Beziehungen losreißt. Der Staat gründet auf dieser Individualisierung der Menschen, die sie als Ansammlung konkurrierender Warenbesitzer und Privateigentümer erscheinen lässt. Er bestätigt und verstärkt diese durch seine eigenen Institutionen und Mechanismen. Als Objekte von Bürokratien, als Rechtssubjekte oder Wählerinnen werden die Individuen unabhängig von ökonomischen, sozialen und kulturellen Zusammenhängen als vereinzelte Staatsbürgerinnen bestimmt und organisiert (Jessop 1985, 63ff.; Holloway 1991, 242ff.; Gellner 1991, 98ff.). Diese für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft typische Form der Individua-lisierung ist historisch einmalig und setzt gänzlich neue Bedingungen für die Möglichkeit, »Gesellschaft« im Bewusstsein der Menschen zu begründen. Die Herrschaft des Markts als Ausdruck eines sich globalisierenden Verwertungszusammenhangs erzwingt eine prinzipiell schrankenlose Mobilität und Austauschbarkeit der Individuen. Seine Durchsetzung ist mit der Auflösung verwandtschaftlicher, nachbarschaftlicher und lokaler Zusammenhänge, der Zerstörung bestehender sozialer und kultureller Milieus sowie der permanenten Umwälzung aller gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse verbunden. Die Tendenz zur Säkularisierung und Rationalisierung unterminiert herkömmliche kulturelle und religiöse Zugehörigkeiten und Orientierungen. Als Warenbesitzer sind die Menschen isolierte Atome und »Weltbürger« zugleich. Die kapitalistische Ökonomie hat also die Tendenz, alle die sozialen Beziehungen, kulturellen Gemeinsamkeiten, kollektiven Orientierungen und Lebenszusammenhänge zu untergraben und fortwährend umzuwälzen, die eine Gesellschaft als bestimmte, sich selbst bewusste überhaupt erst möglich und bestandsfähig machen (Reinhard 2000, 440ff.). Darüber hinaus gibt sie die Menschen einer gesellschaftlichen Maschinerie preis, die um so undurchschaubarer und unbeeinflussbarer erscheint, je mehr sich das Kapitalverhältnis weltweit durchsetzt. Unsicherheit und Angst, die Ungewissheit über sich selbst als gesellschaftliches Individuum - im Jargon des Zeitgeists gesprochen: das Problem der »Identität« - gehören deshalb zu den Grundmerkmalen kapitalistischer Vergesellschaftung. Max Horkheimer sagt dazu: »In Angst hat sich das Individuum historisch konstituiert. Es gibt eine Verstärkung der Angst über die Todesangst hinaus, von der es sich wieder auflöst. Die Vollendung der Zentralisation in Gesellschaft und Staat treibt das Subjekt zu seiner Dezentralisation.« (Horkheimer 1972, 68) Man muss nun davon ausgehen, dass die moderne Nation und der Na-tionalismus das Feld bilden, auf dem der soziale Zusammenhang, die Konstitution von Gesellschaft unter den Bedingungen kapitalistischer Vergesellschaftung symbolisch neu begründet wird. Dies geschieht durch die auf Macht gestützte Erzeugung von Gemeinsamkeiten und Traditionen, die über lokale und partikulare Beziehungen hinausgehen. Notwendig ist dies mit der Abgrenzung gegenüber einem Fremden, Äußerlichen, Exterritorialen verbunden. Mit der Vorstellung von »Nationalität« kann sich die von Individualisierung geprägte, fragmentierte und von sozialen Gegensätzen zerrissene kapitalistische Gesellschaft als bestimmbarer und sinnhafter Zusammenhang, als Einheit begreifen. Dadurch gewinnt sie im Bewusstsein ihrer Mitglieder Konturen, Gemeinsamkeiten und Grenzen und verleiht den Individuen scheinbar einen Ort in Raum und Zeit, vermittelt das Gefühl von Zugehörigkeit und existenzieller Sicherheit (Jackson/Penrose 1993, 202ff.; Anderson 1998; Hobsbawm 1991).”翻译为中文","completion":"这并不意味着现有的国家体系是不可变的。经验观察已经表明，国家不断地消亡和新生——这一发展在苏联解体后获得了特殊的动力。但是，从这一过程中产生一个全球统一的或世界国家在结构上是不太可能的。相反，它导致了一个以不断新的和变化的形式出现的国家体系。例如，常被提及的欧洲一体化进程，很难被视为单一国家体系结束的证据。即使这是一个逐渐形成的综合国家——尽管有很多反对的理由——这只是在仍然由单一国家的竞争所主导的世界体系中产生的一个新的、虽然重要且有分量的国家，正如19世纪德国帝国的创建一样。因此，对资本主义及其发展的分析必须从国家必要多样性的事实出发，但同时也必须考虑到这种多样性始终受到生产条件和阶级关系变化的影响。 7. 国家、民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视 在阐明了多种国家存在和国家竞争是资本主义生产关系的一个基本组成部分之后，现在要讨论的问题是，如何形成“民族”国家，以及国家形式与民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视意识形态之间存在什么关系。首先从历史角度来看，资本主义国家通常是以民族国家的形式构建的，它声称基于一个具有共同特征的统一“民族”——无论是文化的还是种族生物学的——或普遍共享的价值取向。民族国家与资产阶级资本主义社会同时出现。然而，考虑到现代民族国家的早期尝试源于绝对统治者为了创建一个统一、由中央控制的国家领土和人民而做出的努力，资本主义和民族主义之间的联系是复杂的（Anderson 1974; Elias 1978; Balibar/Wallerstein 1992, 107ff.; Reinhard 2000, 440ff.）。因此，不仅国家作为一个集中的暴力机器，而且“民族”国家性质的元素在某种程度上是资本主义之前就存在的，并且是其产生的基础。尽管如此，成熟的民族国家可以被视为全球性资本关系实现的产物，并且与之紧密相关。构造一个包含所有社会成员的“民族身份”的功能是为了掩盖阶级矛盾和中和阶级斗争。但是，函数式解释不能止步于此，还需要问到构造“民族”和动员民族主义的物质社会基础究竟是什么。因此，仅仅考虑构成资本主义国家特殊形式的经济剥削和阶级关系是不够的，还必须深入分析资产阶级资本主义社会形态的进一步和更深层次的维度。 我们可以从一个问题入手，即在资本主义的矛盾结构中，如何使“社会”成为可能，也就是说，如何实现一个联系人们并构建它们共同体的关系。我们之前看到，在市场竞争和阶级对立的条件下，政治共同体只能以与社会分离的国家形式，作为一种抽象的、外在的关系或一种对象关系来呈现。资本主义社会的特点在于，它不仅将人们分裂为对立的阶级和群体，而且还将他们作为市场个体系统地孤立、分离，从所有直接的社会关系中切断。国家建立在这种人们个体化的基础上，他们作为相互竞争的商品拥有者和私有财产者出现。它通过自己的机构和机制确认并加强这一点。作为官僚机构的对象、作为法律主体或选民，个体被独立于经济、社会和文化联系之外定义和组织成孤立的国家公民（Jessop 1985, 63ff.; Holloway 1991, 242ff.; Gellner 1991, 98ff.）。 这种对于资本主义社会典型的个体化形式在历史上是独一无二的，并为在人们意识中建立“社会”的可能性设定了全新的条件。市场的统治作为一个全球化的价值实现过程的表达，强制要求个体的原则上无限的流动性和可替代性。它的实现伴随着亲属、邻里和地方关系的解体、现存的社会和文化环境的破坏以及所有社会关系的持续变革。世俗化和理性化的倾向削弱了传统的文化和宗教归属感和导向。作为商品拥有者，人们同时是孤立的原子和“世界公民”。因此，资本主义经济趋向于不断破坏和改造所有的社会关系、文化共同性、集体导向和生活环境，这些才能使一个社会作为一个特定的、自我意识的实体成为可能并能够存续（Reinhard 2000, 440ff.）。此外，它将人们置于一个社会机器中，随着资本关系的全球实现，这个机器变得越来越难以理解和控制。不确定性和恐惧、对自身作为社会个体的未知——用时代流行语言来说：“身份”的问题——因此成为资本主义社会构成的基本特征。Max Horkheimer这样说：“在恐惧中个体历史性地构建了自己。存在着一种超出死亡恐惧的恐惧的增强，从中它再次解体。社会和国家的中心化的完成推动了主体的去中心化。”（Horkheimer 1972, 68） 我们现在必须认识到，现代民族和民族主义构成了在资本主义社会条件下，社会联系、社会构建在象征层面上重新建立的领域。这是通过基于权力的共同点和传统的创造来实现的，这些超越了地方和特殊的关系。这必然涉及到与外来的、外部的、国外的东西的边界划分。通过“国籍”的概念，受到个体化影响、碎片化和社会对立撕裂的资本主义社会可以作为一个可定义、有意义的整体、作为一个单位来理解。因此，在其成员的意识中，它获得了轮廓、共同点和边界，并让个体感觉到自己在时间和空间中有一个位置，传递了归属感和存在的安全感（Jackson/Penrose 1993, 202ff.; Anderson 1998; Hobsbawm 1991）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Dem liegt zugrunde, was Poulantzas als die besondere kapitalistische Raum- und Zeitmatrix bezeichnet hat (Poulantzas 2002, 123ff.). Erst mit der Durchsetzung der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise entsteht nämlich die Vorstellung eines einheitlichen, linearen und fest abgegrenzten Raums sowie einer gleichförmigen und kontinuierlichen Zeit. Jetzt erst können geographische Räume mit einer bestimmten Ausdehnung und definierten Grenzen als zusammenhängende Einheiten begriffen, eine größere Räume umfassende und vereinheitlichte Zeit entwickelt und die Menschen darin verortet werden. Weil der Kapitalismus vereinzelte und verstreute Produktions- und Lebenszusammenhänge auflöst und die Menschen in räumlich und zeitlich vereinheitlichte Strukturen eingliedert, kann die Anerkennung der gesellschaftlichen Regeln und Institutionen sich nicht mehr auf partikulares Brauchtum, lokale Gemeinschaften und persönliche Beziehungsgeflechte stützen, sondern gründet sich nun - der neuen Raum- und Zeitmatrix folgend - auf die Prinzipien einer linearen nationalen »Tradition« und auf territorial eindeutig umrissene Zugehörigkeit. Das heißt, dass »Gesellschaft« unter kapitalistischen Bedingungen in ganz bestimmter und von früheren historischen Phasen unterschiedener Form »kodiert«, symbolisch begreifbar gemacht wird: als Einheit einer gleichförmigen Masse von Individuen - als »Volk« - dessen Zusammenhang durch zugeschriebene gemeinsame Merkmale - Sprache, Abstammung, kulturelle Werte usw. - gestiftet wird. »Volk« und »Nation« im heutigen Sprachgebrauch hat es daher nicht schon immer gegeben. Sie sind ein Produkt der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise und der damit verbundenen Vergesellschaftungsform. Dies gilt auch für die bestehende Gestalt des Geschlechterverhältnisses. Die in der kapitalistischen politischen Form enthaltene Trennung von Staat und Gesellschaft bedeutet, dass der Staat nicht allein auf dem Klassenverhältnis, sondern auch auf dem durch Ausbeutung und Unterdrückung gekennzeichneten Geschlechterverhältnis beruht und dieses in seinen Institutionen ausdrückt. Dadurch entsteht der strukturelle Widerspruch zwischen gesellschaftlicher Ungleichheit und Unterdrückung einerseits, formeller staatsbürgerlicher Freiheit und Gleichheit auf der anderen Seite, die das kapitalistische Patriarchat kennzeichnet (Genetti 2003). Der von Marx so bezeichnete »Widerspruch der bürgerlichen Konstitution« bezieht sich somit nicht nur auf das Klassen-, sondern auch auf das Ge- schlechterverhältnis (Marx 1969; vgl. auch May 2005). Die mit dem Ge- schlechterverhältnis verbundene Form der Arbeitsteilung - Lohn- und Hausarbeit - ist grundlegend für den kapitalistischen Verwertungs- und Akkumulationsprozess. Die moderne Konstruktion des Geschlechterverhältnisses verbindet sich mit »Nationalität« als Form symbolischer Gemeinschaftlichkeit und dies begründet den Zusammenhang von Nationalismus und Sexismus. Erst mit der Auflösung der traditionellen, ökonomisch begründeten Verwandt-schaftsbeziehungen in den alten Agrarwirtschaften wird die verallgemeinerte und zugleich von allen anderen sozialen Zusammenhängen abgelöste Verbindung von Frauen und Männern als getrennten Geschlechtsindividuen zu einer entscheidenden Grundlage des gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhangs. Die individualisierte Zweigeschlechtlichkeit mit der damit verbundenen Konstruktion von Geschlechtscharakteren - ausgedrückt in der romantischen Liebe und dem Ideal der kleinfamiliären Paarbeziehung - wirkt, ebenso wie der Nationalismus, als ein den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang über Klassenunterschiede hinweg stabilisierender ideologischer Kitt. »Nation« und »Geschlecht« verbinden sich damit aufs engste und sind in ihrer sozialen Konstruktion unmittelbar aufeinander bezogen (Balibar/Wallerstein 1992, 123ff.). Nationalismus und Sexismus sind daher keine äußerlichen oder historisch zufälligen Zutaten, sondern grundlegende Bestandteile der Konstruktion von Gesellschaftlichkeit unter kapitalistischen Bedingungen (Balibar 1993, 132). Praktisch wird dieser Zusammenhang in der Familien- und Bevölke-rungspolitik, die von Anfang an zum Kernbereich nationalstaatlicher Aktivitäten gehört hat. Die »Verstaatlichung« der Familien- und Ge- schlechterverhältnisse ist eine Reaktion auf die Auflösung traditioneller, vorkapitalistischer Produktions- und Beziehungsformen und zielt auf die bürokratisch garantierte Erhaltung der gesellschaftlichen Einrichtung, die die bestehenden sozialen Beziehungen und Unterwerfungsverhältnisse am entscheidendsten prägt und erhält. Gerade in dieser Hinsicht sind Familie und Ehe in der Tat zwar nicht »Keimzellen«, aber wesentliche Grundlagen staatlicher Herrschaftsverhältnisse. Dies ist ein Grund dafür, dass abweichendes sexuelles Verhalten oftmals als gesellschaftszerstörend und damit staatsgefährdend gilt. Ebenso kann Bevölkerungspolitik erst dann bedeutsam werden, wenn ein territorial abgegrenztes »Volk« zum Objekt zentralisierter Planung und Überwachung - von »Geburtenkontrolle« bis hin zur »Asyl«- oder »Einwanderungspolitik« - wird. In der biologischen Konstruktion von Nationalität als abstammungsmäßiger Verwandtschaft fließen beide symbolischen Kodierungen zusammen und hier wird die Verbindung von Nationalismus, Rassismus und Sexismus besonders offenkundig. Es gibt keine gewissermaßen natürlich vorgegebenen Nationen, genauso wenig wie Rassen und Geschlechter. Diese sind vielmehr immer das Produkt von Macht- und Herrschaftsverhältnissen unter bestimmten öko-nomisch-gesellschaftlichen Bedingungen (Reinhard 2000, 440ff.). Es ist daher falsch und leicht widerlegbar, den Nationalstaat als Produkt einer ihm vorausgesetzten »Nation« begreifen zu wollen. Wo heute »Nationen« um »ihren« Staat kämpfen, geschieht dies unter den Bedingungen eines schon bestehenden, durch gewaltsame Herrschaft, soziale Ungleichheiten und Konkurrenz gekennzeichneten Staatensystems, in dem die Selbstnationalisierung in bestimmten Fällen als Überlebensstrategie er-scheinen mag. »Nationalität« ist das Erzeugnis zentralisierter staatlicher Gewaltapparate, ihrer Vereinheitlichungs- und Ausgrenzungsstrategien (Jackson/Penrose 1993, 202ff.). Diese »erfinden« und konstruieren erst die einheitliche »nationale« Kultur, indem sie Abweichendes ausgrenzen, auslöschen und unterdrücken. An den nationalen Hochsprachen wird dies beispielhaft deutlich, die über alle regionalen Dialekte und Idiome hinweg - nicht zuletzt durch das Schulsystem - mittels staatlicher Macht durchgesetzt worden sind. Der moderne Staat-als-Nation entsteht, in- dem bestehende sozio-kulturelle Zusammenhänge und Traditionen zu einem neuen Konstrukt zusammengesetzt werden. Nicht nur Sprache wird konstruiert, sondern ebenso Abstammung und Geschichte, was sich dann in Lehrbüchern, wissenschaftlichen Abhandlungen, Museen und Denkmälern niederschlägt. Die aktuelle Kontroverse um die so genannte Recht-schreibreform ist ein Beispiel für die umkämpfte Durchsetzung eines Macht- und Herrschaftsverhältnisses. Dass diese Nationalisierung mittels Staatsmacht erfolgreich sein kann, hängt allerdings mit gesellschaftlichen Verhältnissen zusammen, in denen - wie gezeigt - »Tradition«, »Zugehörigkeit« und »Identität« für alle Menschen problematisch geworden sind. Die Widersprüchlichkeit dieses Vorgangs besteht im Übrigen darin, dass der Staat als bürokratischer Gewaltapparat sozio-kulturelle Zusammenhänge nicht selbst schaffen, sondern nur benutzen, (re)konstruieren und neu zusammensetzen kann, also immer auch an deren Eigenheit und Eigensinn gebunden bleibt. »Nationalstaaten« im strikten Sinne des Wortes, d.h. Staaten mit wirklich einheitlicher Sprache, »Kultur«, »Tradition« und »Abstammung« hat es deshalb auch nie gegeben. Die Herstellung von Nationalität durch zentralisierte Machtapparate kann im Kern als »Strategie der Ethnisierung« beschrieben werden, als Durchsetzung der Fiktion einer kulturell-biologischen Abstammungs-gemeinschaft (vgl. Kößler/Schiel 1993; Gellner 1991). »Keine moderne Nation hat eine gegebene >ethnische< Basis ... und andererseits gibt es keine moderne Nation, wie >egalitär< sie auch sein mag, in der es keine Klassenkonflikte gibt. Das grundlegende Problem besteht folglich darin, das Volk zu schaffen ... Oder anders gesagt: es gilt die einheitsstiftende Wirkung zu erzeugen, durch die das Volk allen als >ein Volk< erscheint, d.h. als Grundlage und Ursprung politischer Macht.« (Balibar/Waller- stein 1992,115) Diese fiktive Ethnizität begründet den engen Zusammenhang von Nationalismus und Rassismus, denn »wie die modernen Staaten sich nur als Nationen bilden konnten, so konnten die Nationen sich nicht ohne nationalistische Ideologien bilden, und so geht schließlich mit den nationalistischen Ideologien eine rassistische Tendenz einher, die sich je nach den historischen Umständen auf unterschiedliche Objekte >fixiert< findet.« (Balibar 1993, 64f.) In herrschaftlich strukturierten Gesellschaften werden »Rasse« und »Nation« dazu benutzt, um andere von sich und sich von anderen zu unterscheiden. »Wenn die Gleichsetzung zwischen einem bestimmten Volk und einem bestimmten Raum Teil der Vorstellung von >Nation< ist, dann wird die Zuschreibung von >Rasse< die Grundlage des Ausschlusses.« (Jackson/Penrose 1993, 204) Die oft angeführte Entgegensetzung eines politisch-demokratischen und universalistischen »französischen« sowie eines ethnisch-kulturellen und partikula- ristischen »deutschen« Nation-Begriffs ist deshalb kaum haltbar. Beide schließen auf ihre Weise Partikularismus, Ausgrenzung und die Diskriminierung des »Fremden« ein (vgl. dazu Marmora 1983).”翻译为中文","completion":"这基础上是波兰察斯所称的特定的资本主义空间和时间矩阵（Poulantzas 2002, 123ff）。只有在资本主义生产方式确立之后，人们才形成了对统一、线性和明确划分空间的概念，以及对均匀和连续时间的概念。此时，地理空间才能被理解为具有特定扩展和定义边界的连贯单元，能够发展包括更大空间的统一时间并将人们定位其中。 因为资本主义解散了分散和孤立的生产与生活方式，并将人们纳入空间和时间上统一化的结构中，对社会规则和机构的认可不再依赖于特定的习俗、地方社区和个人关系网，而是遵循新的空间和时间矩阵——基于线性的“民族”传统和明确的领土归属原则。即，资本主义条件下的“社会”以与历史上先前阶段不同的特定形式被“编码”、符号化理解：作为一群拥有共同特征（如语言、血统、文化价值等）的均质个体——即“民族”——的统一体。 因此，今天所说的“民族”和“国家”并非历来就有。它们是资本主义生产方式及其相关社会形态的产物。这同样适用于现存的性别关系形态。资本主义政治形态中包含的国家与社会的分离意味着，国家不仅基于阶级关系，还基于通过剥削和压迫特征的性别关系，并在其机构中表达这种关系。这导致了社会不平等与压迫与形式上的公民自由和平等之间的结构性矛盾，这是资本主义父权制的特征（Genetti 2003）。马克思所指的“资产阶级宪制的矛盾”因此不仅涉及阶级关系，也涉及性别关系（Marx 1969; 参见 May 2005）。与性别关系相关的劳动分配——工资劳动和家务劳动——是资本主义价值增值和积累过程的基础。 现代性别关系的构建与“国籍”作为象征性共同体的形式相结合，这建立了民族主义和性别歧视之间的联系。只有在传统的以经济为基础的亲属关系在古老的农业经济中解体后，将女性和男性作为分开的性别个体的一般化关系，与所有其他社会联系分离，才成为社会联系的决定性基础。个体化的两性关系以及与之相关的性别特征构建——例如在浪漫爱情和小家庭伴侣关系的理想中表达——就像民族主义一样，作为一种稳定社会联系、跨越阶级差异的意识形态粘合剂。因此，“民族”和“性别”在社会构建中紧密相连且相互关联（Balibar/Wallerstein 1992, 123ff.）。因此，民族主义和性别歧视不是外在的或历史偶然的附加物，而是资本主义条件下构建社会性的基本组成部分（Balibar 1993, 132）。 在实践中，这种联系体现在家庭和人口政策中，这从一开始就属于国家的核心活动领域。家庭和性别关系的“国家化”是对解体传统的前资本主义生产和关系形式的反应，旨在通过官働保证维持决定性塑造和维护现有社会关系和服从关系的社会制度。尤其在这方面，家庭和婚姻实际上不是“细胞”但确是国家统治结构的基本基础。这就是为什么偏离性行为常被视为破坏社会、因而危害国家安全的原因之一。同样，人口政策只有在一个领土界定的“民族”成为中央化规划和监控的对象——从“生育控制”到“庇护”或“移民政策”——时才变得重要。在将国籍作为血缘关系的生物构建中，两种象征性编码汇合在一起，这里民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视的联系特别明显。 并不存在所谓自然预设的民族，就像不存在种族和性别一样。这些实际上总是特定经济-社会条件下权力和统治关系的产物（Reinhard 2000, 440ff.）。因此，试图将国家视为其先决条件的“民族”的产物是错误的且容易被驳斥。如今，“民族”争取“自己的”国家，发生在一个已经存在的、由暴力统治、社会不平等和竞争特征的国家体系条件下，自我民族化在某些情况下可能看似是一种生存策略。“国籍”是集中化国家暴力机器、其统一化和排除策略的产物（Jackson/Penrose 1993, 202ff.）。这些通过排斥、消除和压制异差，构造和发明了统一的“民族”文化。在国家通过教育系统等手段，利用国家权力超越所有地方方言和习语强制推行国家通用语中，这一点尤为明显。以国家形式出现的现代国家是通过将现有的社会文化联系和传统构建成一个新结构而形成的。不仅语言被构造，同样还有血统和历史，这反映在教科书、学术论文、博物馆和纪念碑中。所谓的拼写改革争议就是一个有争议的权力和统治关系实施的例子。然而，这种通过国家力量成功实施的民族化能够得逞，是因为——如所示——对所有人而言，“传统”、“归属感”和“身份”已变得具有问题。此外，这个过程的矛盾之处在于，作为官僚暴力机器的国家不能自行创造社会文化联系，只能利用、重构并重新组合它们，因此始终受到其特性和固有意义的限制。因此，严格意义上的“民族国家”，即拥有真正统一语言、“文化”、“传统”和“血统”的国家，从来就不存在。 通过集中化权力机关进行的民族构建，可以本质上被描述为“族群化策略”，即推行文化-生物血缘共同体的虚构（见 Kößler/Schiel 1993; Gellner 1991）。 “没有现代民族是基于给定的‘族群’基础的... 另一方面，没有现代民族，不论它多么‘平等’，不存在阶级冲突。因此，基本问题在于创造民众... 或换言之：需要产生那种统一效应，通过该效应民众对所有人来说看起来就是‘一个人民’，即政治权力的基础和来源。”（Balibar/Wallerstein 1992,115）这种虚构的族群性确立了民族主义和种族主义之间的紧密联系，因为“正如现代国家只能作为民族形成，民族也不能不依赖民族主义意识形态形成，因此民族主义意识形态最终带有种族主义倾向，这种倾向根据不同的历史情况‘固定’在不同的对象上。”（Balibar 1993, 64f.）在统治结构化的社会中，“种族”和“民族”被用来区分自己与他人。“如果将某特定人民与某特定空间的等同视为‘民族’的一部分，那么‘种族’的归属将成为排除的基础。”（Jackson/Penrose 1993, 204）因此，常见的将政治民主且普遍主义的“法国”民族概念与种族文化且特定主义的“德国”民族概念相对立的说法几乎是不成立的。两者以各自的方式包含特定主义、排外性和对“外来者”的歧视（参考 Marmora 1983）。"},{"prompt":"请将“»Nationalität« gründet immer auf der Abgrenzung gegenüber einem kulturell oder abstammungsmäßig als anders oder fremd Bestimmten, wobei nationale »Identität« sich in der Regel auf den Gegensatz zum Fremden sowohl außerhalb als auch innerhalb der staatlichen Grenzen bezieht (Reinhard 2000, 440ff.). Der moderne Rassismus geht aus dem Nationalismus hervor und richtet sich infolge der gesellschaftlichen Zerrissenheit immer zugleich nach innen und außen. Es ist die staatliche Organisationsform, die äußere und innere Ausgrenzungen, »Fremde« und ethnische und kulturelle »Minderheiten« erst schafft. Ohne zentralisierte Herrschaft über ein Territorium wären diese nicht denkbar. Der Rassismus »durchdringt nicht die staatlichen Institutionen, sondern ist institutionell« (Balibar 1993,67). Er kann als eine Art »staatlicher Psychostruktur« verstanden werden. Die Individuen, die der Ideologie nach »souveräne« Staatsbürger, in Wirklichkeit aber Untertanen, genau in diesem Sinne eben »Subjekte« sind, können dadurch, »dass sie sich hinter dem Staat verstek- ken, diese Ohnmacht aggressiv auf die >rassisierten< Gruppen lenken« (ebd., 70). Der Rassismus ist ebenso wie die moderne Konstruktion des Geschlechterverhältnisses ein Mittel der sozialen Spaltung und der Desorganisation der beherrschten Klassen innerhalb und über einzelstaatliche Grenzen hinweg. Durch diese Mechanismen von Unterdrückung und Herrschaft begründet sich das Volk als Nation. Weil staatliche Grenzen immer durchlässig sind und die »ethnische« Einheit grundsätzlich unbestimmt und unsicher bleiben muss, gewinnt der Rassismus seine fortwährende Wirksamkeit und Dynamik. Der Begriff der Staatsbürgerschaft hängt deshalb eng mit dem der Nation zusammen. Zunächst einmal gibt es bekanntermaßen keine allgemeine, für alle Menschen geltende Staatsbürgerschaft und damit auch faktisch keine allgemein durchsetzbaren gleichen Menschenrechte. Die Vorstellung grundlegender, allgemeiner und gleicher Rechte der Menschen hat sich mit der Entstehung der modernen Nationalstaaten, der Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus und durch die damit verbundenen Kämpfe herausgebildet und bricht sich zugleich daran. Menschenrechte sind - soweit überhaupt - faktisch immer nur als Staatsbürgerrechte wirksam. Und diese Staatsbürgerschaft beruht grundsätzlich auf vielfältigen Diskriminierungen und Ausgrenzungen: der Trennung von »Öffentlich« und »Privat« und der damit verbundenen Begründung eines ungleichen Geschlechter- verhältnisses, dem Ausschluss von »Fremden« innerhalb und außerhalb der nationalen Grenzen und auf der Ungleichheit sozialer Möglichkeiten und Rechte. Prinzipiell bedeutet daher die durch Macht hergestellte Zugehörigkeit zu einem Gemeinwesen noch lange nicht die Möglichkeit zur Ausübung politischer Beteiligungsrechte (ebd., 87ff.). Diese müssen erst erstritten werden. Die sozialen und politischen Kämpfe, die in einigen entwickelten kapi-talistischen Staaten zur Herausbildung eines »demokratischen Sozialstaats« führten, haben historisch eine gewisse Verallgemeinerung der Staatsbürgerschaft über Klassen- und Geschlechtergrenzen hinweg ge-schaffen. Sie haben die wenigstens halbwegs einheitliche »Nation« rechtlich und materiell begründet. Zugleich waren sie die Grundlage für die Durchsetzung einer Klassenhegemonie, in der die herrschende Klasse den Anspruch einer über alle sozialen Spaltungen hinausgehenden national- popularen »politischen Führung« erheben konnte (Jessop 1985, 55). »Die »gefährlichen Klassen< konnten damit den Zugang zur Staatsbürgerschaft erlangen - und überhaupt erst beginnen, den >Rechten am Arbeitsplatz< als einem notwendigen Bestandteil derselben Anerkennung zu verschaffen -, indem sie sich selbst in Glieder des nationalen >Körpers< transformierten.« (Balibar 1993, 82) Der nationale Sozialstaat »ist ein Staat, der die Klassenkämpfe nicht unterbindet ... ihnen aber die >nackte< Form einer Konfrontation von einander äußerlichen Kräften nimmt, die Form des Bürgerkriegs.« (ebd., 94) Die politischen Vertretungen der Arbeiterklasse, einstmals als Vereinigungen »vaterlandsloser Gesellen« abgestempelt, konnten damit allmählich zu Stützen des nationalen Staates werden. Im Sozial- und Interventionsstaat der kapitalistischen Metropolen manifestiert sich so nicht nur ein entscheidender Schritt zur historischen Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus, indem die Arbeiterklasse mittels demokratischer Mitsprache, sozialer Sicherungen und Massenkonsum zu einem integralen Bestandteil des Kapitalverhältnisses wurde, sondern auch als Vollendung des relativ homogenen Nationalstaats, der sozialen »einen Nation«. Ein Angelpunkt dafür war die staatliche Kontrolle des Geldes, das damit in den Rang eines nationalen Symbols aufstieg, Nationalität und nationale Zusammengehörigkeit auch materiell begründete (Polanyi 1990, 274ff.). Entscheidend ist allerdings, dass diese - einstmals etwa im »DM-Nationalismus« zum Ausdruck kommende - »nationale« Gemeinsamkeit, die einen gewissen Ausgleich der gesellschaftlichen Antagonismen erlaubt, grundsätzlich auf innere und äußere Diskriminierung, auf Rassismus, internationale Unterdrückung und Abhängigkeit gegründet bleibt und - der grundlegenden Logik von »Nationalität« folgend - auch bleiben muss. Auch die Herausbildung des modernen Sozialstaats, der die Entstehung einer politisch-sozial halbwegs einheitlichen Nation über Klassen- und Geschlechtergrenzen hinweg ermöglicht hat, blieb deshalb grundsätzlich mit Nationalismus, Rassismus und Sexismus - auch innerhalb der Arbeiterbewegung - verbunden. Dies erklärt, weshalb die Beseitigung relativer sozialer Gleichheit auf sowohl innerstaatlicher wie auch internationaler Ebene, die ein charakteristisches Merkmal der gegenwärtigen Umstrukturierung des globalen Kapitalismus darstellt, nationalistische und rassistische Konflikte verstärkt. Damit verändert sich erneut die historische Bedeutung beider. Auch in den kapitalistisch entwickelten Ländern werden die zumindest nach innen hin relativ »zivilisierten«, auf sozialen Ausgleich und materielle Gemeinschaftlichkeit gerichteten Inhalte von Nationalität durch diskriminierende und aggressivere ersetzt. Die universalistische Bedeutung von Staatsbürgerschaft, der darin ent-haltene Anspruch gleicher Rechte für alle Menschen, wird faktisch immer mehr in Frage gestellt. Damit nehmen die Tendenzen zu einer ethnischrassistischen »Besetzung« der Nationalstaaten zu und zugleich gehen einmal unternommene Ansätze zur Schaffung nicht primär ethnisch begründeter Staaten in Gemetzeln unter. In seiner »fordistischen« Phase nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg war der Kapitalismus mit dem weltweit geltend gemachten Versprechen auf allge-meine materielle Wohlfahrt, fortschreitende soziale Gleichheit und »Ent-wicklung« verbunden und schien dies eine Zeit lang tatsächlich einlösen zu können. Nationalismus und Rassismus als grundlegende Elemente kapitalistischer Nationalstaatlichkeit konnten dadurch etwas in den Hin-tergrund treten. Die in den 1970er Jahren ausgebrochene Krise des For- dismus hat dem ein Ende bereitet. Mit der Verschärfung von innerstaatlichen und internationalen Ungleichheiten und mit wachsenden materiellen Diskriminierungen kam es zu einer erneuerten Konjunktur von Nationalismus und Rassismus. Es bleibt die Frage, wie notwendig der Zusammenhang zwischen Ka-pitalismus, Nationalismus, Rassismus und Sexismus ist. Zunächst einmal darf dieser nicht als Ausdruck einer einfachen, die geschichtliche Entwicklung eindeutig bestimmenden »Logik« begriffen werden. Wie schon angedeutet, gibt es historische Veränderungen in der Bedeutung von Nationalstaat, Nationalismus und Rassismus, die von sozialen Kämpfen, historisch durchgesetzten Kompromissen und Kräfteverhältnissen bestimmt werden. Dasselbe gilt für die Konstruktion der Geschlechterverhältnisse. Geschichte ist grundsätzlich das Ergebnis sozialer Handlungen von Individuen, Gruppen und Klassen, die allerdings, sobald das kapitalistische Produktionsverhältnis einmal herrscht, strukturellen Zwängen unterlie-gen, die nicht ohne weiteres durchbrochen werden können. Es gibt demnach keinen einfachen und funktionalen Zusammenhang von Kapitalismus, Nationalismus, Rassismus und Sexismus. Diese verändern ihre Bedeutung, ihren Inhalt und die Form ihrer Verknüpfung und können, je nach den sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen und internationalen Konflikten, »sanftere« oder aggressivere Formen annehmen. Die Objekte, auf die sie sich fixieren, verändern sich. Allerdings geht die Hoffnung auf eine immanente zivilisatorische Tendenz der kapitalistischen Entwicklung fehl, da Nationalismus, Rassismus und in spezifischer Weise auch der Sexismus in seine soziale und politische Grundstruktur eingebettet sind und daher immer wieder hervorbrechen.”翻译为中文","completion":"“国籍”始终建立在对文化上或血缘上被定义为不同或外来的东西的界定之上，而国家的“身份”通常指的是对国内外“外来者”的对立（Reinhard 2000, 440ff）。现代种族主义源于民族主义，并由于社会的撕裂，始终同时向内向外发力。正是国家的组织形式首次创造了外部和内部的排除、“外来者”以及种族和文化“少数群体”。没有对一个领土的集中统治，这些事情是无法想象的。种族主义“不是渗透国家机构，而是机构化的”（Balibar 1993,67）。它可以被理解为一种“国家心理结构”。根据意识形态，那些“主权”的公民实际上却是臣民，将自己隐藏在国家之后，可以把这种无力感以侵略性的方式转移到被“种族化”的群体身上（同上，70）。像现代性别关系的构建一样，种族主义是用来分化社会，瓦解被统治阶级内部及跨国界的手段。通过这些压迫和统治机制，民族作为一个国家得以基础。由于国家边界总是存在渗透性，且“种族”身份从根本上是不确定和不稳定的，种族主义保持其持续的效力和动力。 因此，公民身份的概念与民族密切相关。首先，众所周知，并不存在对所有人普遍适用的公民身份，因此实际上也没有普遍可执行的同等人权。基本的、普遍的和平等的人权观念是随现代民族国家、资本主义确立及相关斗争的发展而形成的，同时也正由此受阻。人权——只要有的话——实际上总是作为国民权来实施。而这种公民身份基本上建立在多种歧视和排除之上：即“公共”与“私人”的分离及由此产生的不平等性别关系，排除国内外的“外来者”，以及社会机会和权利的不平等。从根本上说，通过权力形成的对一个共同体的归属并不意味着参与政治权利的可能性（同上，87ff）。这些权利必须争取得来。 一些发达资本主义国家中的社会和政治斗争导致了“民主社会国家”的形成，这在历史上在阶级和性别界限之上实现了公民身份的某种普遍化。它们合法和物质地奠定了至少在一定程度上统一的“民族”。同时，它们是建立阶级霸权的基础，在这种霸权中，统治阶级可以提出跨越所有社会分裂的国家-大众“政治领导”权（Jessop 1985, 55）。\\"危险阶级\\"因此可以获得公民身份——并首次开始认可\\"劳动权\\"作为其组成部分的必要性——通过将自己转化为国家\\"身体\\"的一部分（Balibar 1993, 82）。“民族社会国家”并不阻止阶级斗争……但是它去除了对抗性力量之间的“裸露”形式，即内战的形式（同上，94）。工人阶级的政治代表，曾经被标记为“无国籍者”的联合体，因此逐渐成为民族国家的支柱。在资本主义大都市的社会干预国家中，不仅体现了资本主义历史确立的决定性步骤，通过民主参与、社会保障和大众消费使工人阶级成为资本关系的一个不可或缺的部分，而且还体现了相对同质民族国家的完善，即社会“一个民族”。这点的一个关键是国家对货币的控制，从而使货币成为国家象征，也物质地奠定了国籍和国家凝聚力（Polanyi 1990, 274ff）。然而，关键是这种 - 曾经在“马克国民主义”中表达的 - “民族”共同体，它允许了社会对立的某种程度的调和，从根本上仍然基于内部和外部的歧视、种族主义、国际压迫和依赖，并且 - 遵循“国籍”的基本逻辑 - 也必须保持如此。即使是现代社会国家的形成，它能够在阶级和性别界限之上实现政治-社会上相对统一的民族，也基本上与民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视 - 甚至在工人运动内部 - 相关。 这解释了为什么当前全球资本主义重组的特征——国内外相对社会平等的消除，强化了民族和种族冲突。这再次改变了它们的历史意义。即使在资本主义发达国家，相对“文明化”的、以社会平衡和物质共同性为目标的民族内容也被歧视性和更具侵略性的内容所取代。 公民身份的普遍意义，其中包含的所有人平等权利的要求，实际上正越来越受到质疑。这加剧了国民国家向种族-民族主义“转变”的趋势，同时，旨在创建非主要基于种族的国家的尝试也在屠杀中失败。 在二战后的“福特主义”阶段，资本主义与全球通行的普遍物质福祉、逐步社会平等和“发展”的承诺相连，并在一段时间内似乎真的能够实现这一承诺。民族主义和种族主义作为资本主义民族国家的基本元素，因此有些退到幕后。1970年代爆发的福特主义危机结束了这一切。随着国家内部和国际不平等的加剧以及物质歧视的增加，民族主义和种族主义遭遇了新一轮的热潮。 问题在于，资本主义、民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视之间的联系有多必要。首先，这种联系不能被理解为决定历史发展的简单、明确的“逻辑”。如前所述，国民国家、民族主义和种族主义的意义具有历史变化性，由社会斗争、历史上达成的妥协和力量对比决定。性别关系的构建也是如此。历史基本上是由个人、团体和阶级的社会行为的结果，尽管一旦资本主义生产关系占据主导，它们就会受到结构性强制，这种强制不是那么容易就能突破的。 因此，资本主义、民族主义、种族主义和性别歧视之间没有简单和功能性的联系。它们的含义、内涵和联系形式随着社会力量对比和国际冲突的变化，可能采取“温和”或更具侵略性的形式。它们的目标也发生变化。然而，希望资本主义发展存在内在的文明化趋势是徒劳的，因为民族主义、种族主义和以特定方式的性别歧视嵌入其社会和政治基本结构中，因此总会再次爆发。"},{"prompt":"请将“8. Kapitalismus, Staat und Demokratie In der wissenschaftlichen wie auch in der politischen Diskussion scheint es inzwischen ganz selbstverständlich zu sein, dass »Demokratie« die politischen Systeme bezeichnet, die gemeinhin in den kapitalistisch entwickelteren Regionen der Welt, insbesondere also im Nordwesten des Globus beheimatet sind. Dies wiederum führt zu dem Schluss, dass demokratische Verhältnisse eng mit dem Vorhandensein einer »freien«, das heißt kapitalistischen Marktwirtschaft verbunden sind. Daraus folgt die ebenso nachhaltig propagierte wie verbreitete Vorstellung, es bedürfe in den übrigen Teilen der Welt nur entschlossener marktwirtschaftlicher »Strukturanpassungen«, um schließlich auch dort der Demokratie zum Durchbruch zu verhelfen. Dabei stört allerdings die Tatsache etwas, dass es bisweilen der Einsetzung von Militärdiktaturen bedurfte, um liberal-marktwirtschaftliche Verhältnisse durchzusetzen, zum Beispiel in Chile in den 1970er Jahren. Blickt man schließlich auf die so genannten ostasiatischen Tigerstaaten oder das kapitalistisch prosperierende China, so scheinen Kapitalismus und Demokratie einander nicht zu bedingen. Nicht nur dort gilt autoritäre Herrschaft als besonderer kapitalistischer »Standortvorteil«. Das wirft die Frage auf, welcher Zusammenhang zwischen Kapitalismus und Demokratie besteht, was beide mit dem modernen Staat zu tun haben und was überhaupt unter dem Begriff Demokratie zu verstehen ist. Gesellschaften, die sich als »demokratisch« bezeichnen, hat es in der Geschichte bekanntlich viele und höchst verschiedenartige gegeben. Dazu gehören die antike Polis, die ihre ökonomische Grundlage in der Sklaverei hatte, ebenso wie Großbritannien oder die USA heute. Als Demokratien haben sich auch solche Systeme bezeichnet, in denen das »Volk« von jeder wirklichen politischen Mitsprache ausgeschlossen war, wie zum Beispiel die »Volksdemokratien« des ehemaligen sowjetischen Machtblocks. Der heute gängige Demokratiebegriff meint in der Regel ein politisches System, das durch freie und allgemeine Wahlen, parlamentarische Repräsentationsverfahren, ein Minimum rechtsstaatlicher Garantien, gewisse Formen der Gewaltenteilung, die Möglichkeit eines friedlichen und geregelten Regierungswechsels auf der Basis eines Mehrparteiensystems und die Geltung bestimmter Grundrechte gekennzeichnet ist. Zu diesen Grundrechten gehört nach herrschendem Verständnis vor allem das Privateigentum an Produktionsmitteln, in das politisch, also durch den »demokratischen Willensbildungsprozess«, nicht eingegriffen werden darf. Schon damit werden der in Wahlen oder Volksabstimmungen geäußerten demokratischen Willensbildung klare Grenzen gesetzt. Die Durchsetzung kapitalistischer Produktionsverhältnisse schuf die Voraussetzungen dafür, dass der zentralisierte und verselbständigte Territorialsaat entstehen konnte. Dieser ist wiederum eine wesentliche Grundlage liberaldemokratischer Verhältnisse. In ihm unterliegen die Menschen als Staatsbürgerinnen einer zentralen politischen Gewalt. Daher der Begriff des »Subjekts« als des/der »Unterworfenen«. Unter kapitalistischen Bedingungen wird die formelle Gleichheit aller Menschen - oder genauer der Staatsbürgerinnen - als auf dem Markt konkurrierende Warenbesitzerinnen zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte materielle Wirklichkeit. Freiheit und Gleichhalt erhalten damit eine ökonomische Grundlage und verhelfen den Ideen der Aufklärung zu allgemeiner Wirksamkeit. Die sich herausbildende Trennung von »Staat« und »Gesellschaft«, von »Politik« und »Ökonomie wird zur entscheidenden Bedingung für die Durchsetzung repräsentativ-demokratischer Verhältnisse. Erst dann, wenn der Staat als zentralisierter politischer Gewaltapparat von der Gesellschaft und deren Ungleichheits- und Machtverhältnissen formell getrennt ist, wenn ökonomische und gesellschaftliche Macht mit der politischen nicht unmittelbar identisch ist, kann Herrschaft einer demokratischen politi- sehen Kontrolle unterworfen werden. Die historische Entwicklung dahin war allerdings höchst komplex und widersprüchlich. Wie schon gezeigt wurde, ist es keinesfalls so, dass die kapitalistische Gesellschaft den Staat als zentralisierten Gewaltapparat aus sich heraus hervorgebracht hätte. Die Entstehung zentralisierter, bürokratisierter und territorial klar abgegrenzter Herrschaftsapparate - auf dem europäischen Kontinent in der Form der absoluten Monarchien - war vielmehr selbst eine Voraussetzung der bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Entwicklung (vgl. Kap. 1.5). Erst durch die Schaffung zentral kontrollierter und territorial klar abgegrenzter politischer Räume konnten starke und geschlossene »Nationalökonomien« entstehen. Dadurch wurde die Durchsetzung von Regeln möglich, die eine entfaltete Marktwirtschaft funktionsfähig machen, konnten die infrastrukturellen Voraussetzungen der Kapitalakkumulation geschaffen werden (Kommunikations- und Verkehrswege, Gesundheitsvorsorge usw.) und erst dadurch standen dem Kapital die konzentrierten militärischen Gewaltmittel zur Verfügung, die es zu seiner internationalen Expansion benötigte (Gill/Law 1993, 97ff.). Von Anfang an entwickelten sich die einzelstaatlich organisierten kapitalistischen Gesellschaften im Rahmen eines sich entfaltenden Weltmarkts. Koloniale Herrschaft und darauf gegründete Handelsbeziehungen bildeten eine entscheidende Grundlage der Kapitalakkumulation und der Industrialisierung (Wallerstein 1979; Gerstenberger 1990; v. Braunmühl 1973; Balibar/Wallerstein 1992). Die Beherrschung und Ausbeutung einer kolonial abhängigen Peripherie steht somit an der Wiege der heute existierenden Demokratien. Sie sind historisch und strukturell auf Gewalt und Ausgrenzung sowohl nach innen wie nach außen gegründet. Ebenso widersprüchlich und komplex sind die Zusammenhänge zwischen der Entstehung des kapitalistischen Territorialstaats und der liberalen politischen Demokratie. Auch wenn man die herrschende Form der Demokratie als »bürgerlich« bezeichnen kann, so ist es doch keinesfalls die Bourgeoisie, die sie aus eigenem Antrieb geschaffen hat. Ihr Interesse beschränkte sich auf den Schutz der Geschäftstätigkeit vor willkürlichen herrschaftlichen Ubergriffen und auf die Berechenbarkeit der staatlichen Politik, wozu die Durchsetzung verfassungsmäßiger Sicherungen (»Rechtsstaat«) und eigene politische Kontroll- und Mitspracherechte insbesondere in Haushalts- und Finanzfragen eine wichtige Voraussetzung war. »No taxation without representation« hieß das Losungswort der nordamerikanischen bürgerlichen Revolution. Einer Ausdehnung der politischen Beteiligung und insbesondere des Wahlrechts über die eigene Klasse hinaus stand die Bourgeoisie immer höchst ablehnend gegenüber. Die bürgerliche Demokratie beschränkte sich zunächst auf die zur Herrschaft drängende Klasse oft verbunden mit einem auf Besitz beschränkten Wahlrecht. Die Durchsetzung allgemeiner staatsbürgerlicher Gleichheit und Freiheit sowie die allmähliche Einführung des allgemeinen Wahlrechts war vor allem eine Folge der politischen und sozialen Kämpfe der Arbeiterklasse, die durch die Forderungen der sich politisch organisierenden Frauen ergänzt und weitergetrieben wurden. Dass diese Kämpfe stattfinden und erfolgreich geführt werden konnten, liegt wiederum an den besonderen gesellschaftlichen Strukturen des sich entwickelnden Industriekapitalismus. Die traditionelle, feudal geprägte agrarische Grundbesitzerklasse büßte gegenüber der Industrie- und Finanzbourgeoisie allmählich an ökonomischer und politischer Bedeutung ein. Die Entstehung großer Fabriken und Städte sowie die Verbesserung der Transport- und Kommunikationsmöglichkeiten schufen die Voraussetzungen für die politische Organisierung der ökonomisch und politisch beherrschten Klassen (vgl. dazu v.a. Rueschemeyer u.a. 1992). Die kapitalistischen Zentren entwickelten sich ökonomisch zu Lasten der - kolonialen - Peripherie. Ihre ökonomische und politische Vorherrschaft schuf die materiellen Spielräume für soziale Zugeständnisse, mit denen die internen Klassengegensätze einigermaßen befriedbar waren. Ohne diese hätten demokratische politische Verhältnisse auf längere Sicht kaum stabil sein können. Die einzelstaatliche Aufspaltung des globalen Kapitalismus war damit eine Voraussetzung dafür, dass in einigen Teilen der Welt bürgerlich-demokratische Verhältnisse erkämpft werden konnten, während in den übrigen Regionen wesentliche Bedingungen dafür fehlten und entsprechende Entwicklungen unterbunden wurden. Damit konnte ein die sozialen Klassen, die gesellschaftlichen Ungleichheiten, die Geschlechterdifferenzen und kulturellen Unterschiede übergreifendes »Nationalbewusstsein« entstehen, das die Einheit der Gesellschaft in Abgrenzung nach außen über die sozialen Spaltungen und ökonomischen Ausbeutungsverhältnisse hinweg ideologisch zu begründen vermochte.”翻译为中文","completion":"8. 资本主义、国家与民主 在科学和政治讨论中，似乎已经成为共识，“民主”指的是那些通常位于世界资本主义较为发达地区的政治体系，尤其是全球西北部。这进一步导致了这样的结论：民主关系与“自由”即资本主义市场经济的存在密切相关。 由此产生了一个同样被大力宣传和广泛接受的观念，即世界其他地区只需进行坚定的市场经济“结构调整”，最终也能实现民主。 然而，有时需要通过军事独裁来实现自由市场的关系，例如1970年代的智利，这一事实却有些扰人。 最终，如果观察所谓的东亚“四小龙”或资本主义繁荣的中国，似乎资本主义和民主并不相互依赖。不仅在那里，威权统治被视为特别的资本主义“地理优势”。 这引发了一个问题，即资本主义与民主之间的关系是什么，两者与现代国家有何关联，以及“民主”这一概念究竟指什么。历史上有许多被称为“民主”的社会，它们各不相同。这其中包括以奴隶制为经济基础的古希腊城邦，也包括今天的英国或美国。一些将自己称为民主制的体系，其中“人民”被排除在真正的政治参与之外，例如前苏联权力集团的“人民民主国家”。目前通用的民主概念通常指的是一个通过自由和普遍选举、议会代表制度、最低限度的法治保障、某些权力分立形式、基于多党制的和平和有序的政府更迭以及特定基本权利有效的政治体系。按照主流理解，这些基本权利尤其包括生产资料的私有财产权，政治上也就是通过“民主意志形成过程”不得干预。这已经为通过选举或公投表达的民主意志形成设置了明确限制。 资本主义生产关系的实现为中央集权和独立的领土国家的形成创造了条件。该国家是自由民主关系的一个重要基础。在其下，人民作为国民受到中央政治权力的管辖。因此有了“主体”作为“服从者”的概念。在资本主义条件下，所有人——或更准确地说所有国民——作为市场上竞争的商品拥有者的形式平等第一次在历史上成为物质现实。自由和平等因此获得了经济基础，使启蒙时代的理念变得普遍有效。“国家”与“社会”、“政治”与“经济”的分离成为实现代议制民主关系的决定条件。只有当国家作为中央集权的政治暴力机器与社会及其不平等和权力关系形式上分离时，当经济和社会权力与政治不直接等同时，统治才能受到民主政治控制。历史发展向这个方向的道路却是高度复杂和矛盾的。如前所述，并非资本主义社会自行产生了国家作为中央集权的暴力机器。中央集权、官僚化、明确划分领土的统治机构的出现——在欧洲大陆以绝对君主制的形式——反而是资产阶级资本主义发展的前提条件（见第1.5章）。只有通过创造中央控制和明确划分的政治空间，才能形成强大和统一的“国民经济”。这使得实施让发达市场经济能够正常运作的规则成为可能，能够为资本积累创造基础设施条件（通信和交通线路，卫生保健等），并为资本提供其国际扩张所需的集中军事力量（Gill/Law 1993, 97ff）。从一开始，各个国家组织的资本主义社会就在展开的世界市场框架内发展。殖民统治和基于此的贸易关系构成了资本积累和工业化的重要基础（Wallerstein 1979; Gerstenberger 1990; v. Braunmühl 1973; Balibar/Wallerstein 1992）。对殖民地依赖外围的控制和剥削就是现存民主的摇篮。从历史和结构上讲，它们建立在内外暴力和排斥的基础之上。 资本主义领土国家的产生与自由主义政治民主之间的关系同样是矛盾和复杂的。即便可以称目前的民主形式为“资产阶级”的，但资产阶级本身并非出于自己的动力创造了它。它们的兴趣局限于保护商业活动免受权力的任意干预，以及确保国家政策的可预测性，为此推动宪法保护（“法治”）及自身在预算和财政问题上的政治控制和发言权是重要的前提。“没有代表就没有征税”是北美资产阶级革命的口号。对于政治参与的扩大特别是选举权的扩展超出自己的阶级，资产阶级始终持极为反对的态度。资产阶级民主最初仅限于渴望统治的阶级，往往与基于财产的选举权相结合。普遍国民的平等与自由以及普遍选举权的逐渐实现主要是工人阶级政治和社会斗争的结果，这些斗争通过政治组织化的女性的要求得到了补充和推进。这些斗争得以发生并成功进行，再次归因于发展中的工业资本主义的特殊社会结构。与工业和金融资产阶级相比，传统的、封建的农业土地所有者阶级逐渐失去了经济和政治意义。大工厂和城市的出现以及交通和通信方式的改善为经济和政治被统治阶级的政治组织提供了条件（参见主要是Rueschemeyer等人，1992）。 资本主义中心以牺牲（殖民的）外围地区为代价经济发展。它们的经济和政治优势为社会妥协创造了物质条件，这些妥协在一定程度上能够安抚内部阶级对立。如果没有这些，民主政治关系可能无法长期稳定。全球资本主义的单个国家分割为世界的某些部分能够争取到资产阶级民主关系，而在其他地区则缺少实现这一进程的必要条件，并且相应的发展被阻断。这就产生了一个跨越社会阶级、社会不平等、性别差异和文化差异的“国家意识”，从理念上为社会的统一提供了基础，跨越了社会分裂和经济剥削关系对外部的界定。"},{"prompt":"请将“Die Form der Demokratie, die sich mit der Herausbildung der modernen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft seit dem 18. Jahrhundert durchgesetzt hat, kann insoweit als »bürgerliche« oder »liberale« bezeichnet werden. Die kapitalistische Vergesellschaftungsweise und die mit ihr verbundene politische Form bildet ihre Grundlage und markiert zugleich ihre Grenzen. Entgegen dem Wortlaut des Begriffs beinhaltet sie keinesfalls eine umfassende Volksherrschaft. Eher könnte man sie als ein System pluralistischer Machtverteilung - zwischen Parteien, Unternehmungen, Staatsbürokratien usw. - mit gewissen demokratischen Beteiligungsmöglichkeiten bezeichnen. Joseph Schumpeter hat diese Demokratie recht treffend als die Staatsform bezeichnet, in der verschiedene Machtgruppen in periodischen Abständen um Wählerstimmen konkurrieren und damit verdeutlicht, dass sie in gewisser Weise die Strukturen der kapitalistischen Marktwirtschaft reflektiert, in der die »Konsumentensouveränität« bekanntlich ihre Grenzen hat (Schumpeter 1950). Die theoretische Rechtfertigung dieser Beschränkung liegt in der Annahme, volle Volkssouveränität würde zu einer Diktatur der Mehrheit oder gar einer den Mehrheitswillen für sich beanspruchenden Partei und damit zu einem totalitären, die persönliche Freiheit bedrohenden politischen Herrschaftssystem führen. Ihre praktische Grundlage allerdings sind die kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisse. Zu garantieren, dass diese nicht durch demokratische Mehrheitsentscheidungen abgeschafft werden, ist Sinn und Zweck der für die »bürgerliche« Demokratie charakteristischen Repräsentations- urid Gewaltenteilungsverfahren. Gemessen an früheren Zuständen bedeutet ihre Durchsetzung zweifellos einen Fortschritt bei der Verwirklichung von allgemeiner Freiheit und Gleichheit. Dieser hat allerdings klare Grenzen. Er blieb bislang auf einige Teile der Welt beschränkt und stößt auch dort auf Schranken, die mit der Existenz gesellschaftlicher Ungleichheiten, z.B. patriarchalen Herrschaftsstrukturen und nicht zuletzt den kapitalistischen Produktions- und Eigentumsverhältnissen gesetzt sind. Das heißt, dass das, was innerhalb der liberalen Demokratie an »Freiheit«, »Gleichheit« und »Selbstbestimmung« verwirklicht ist, strukturell immer auf gesellschaftlicher Unfreiheit, Ungleichheit und Fremdbestimmung beruht. Generell gilt, dass die politischen Verhältnisse, wie sie sich in Gestalt der liberalen Demokratie herausgebildet haben, kein abgeschlossener Zustand sind, sondern ein von gesellschaftlichen Antagonismen und Konflikten durchzogenes Kampffeld darstellen. Dies wirft die Frage nach der Möglichkeit einer Weiterentwicklung der Demokratie über die bestehende Form hinaus auf. Dabei geht es darum, ob es möglich ist, die der bürgerlichen Demokratie innewohnenden, aber unter kapitalistischen Verhältnissen nicht verwirklichbaren Prinzipien praktisch einzulösen, ein politisches Gemeinwesen zu entwickeln, in dem die Forderungen nach allgemeiner Freiheit, Gleichheit, Individualität und Selbstbestimmung tatsächlich realisiert sind. Dies bedeutet zunächst einmal, dass die heute bestehende Demokratie einschließlich ihrer theoretischen Begründungen an den Normen und Prinzipien kritisch zu messen ist, die im Zuge der langen Kämpfe um ihre Durchsetzung entwickelt wurden, aber aufgrund der ihr zugrundeliegenden gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse nie verwirklicht werden konnten. Entgegen der verbreiteten Auffassung, mit dem Ende des Kalten Kriegs und der Konkurrenz der Gesellschaftssysteme sei auch das Ende der Geschichte und damit der Gestaltbarkeit von Gesellschaft gekommen, gilt es, die bürgerlich-liberale Demokratie als historische, unter ganz bestimmten Bedingungen entstandene Form zu begreifen, die veränderbar ist. Die Frage der Veränderbarkeit stellt sich besonders angesichts einer Entwicklung, die unverkennbare Tendenzen zur Rückbildung demokratischer Verhältnisse hinter den historisch schon einmal erreichten Stand beinhaltet. D as aktuelle Problem ist, dass die Globalisierung darauf angelegt ist, selbst die vorhandenen liberaldemokratischen Strukturen zu unterminieren. Die Frage einer Vereinbarkeit von Kapitalismus und Demokratie stellt sich damit in einer historisch neuen und verschärften Weise. Blickt man auf die Geschichte der bürgerlichen Demokratien, so scheint tatsächlich ein enger Zusammenhang zwischen der Entwicklung des Kapitalismus, des modernen Nationalstaats und politisch demokratischer Verhältnisse zu bestehen. In gewisser Weise kann die liberale Repräsentativdemokratie als politische Form des Kapitalismus begriffen werden, weil dessen Entwicklung die materiellen Bedingungen für ihre Durchsetzung schuf und sie gleichzeitig eine Form der Regulierung der Klassenverhältnisse darstellt, die eine Voraussetzung für den Bestand des Systems darstellt. Dieser Zusammenhang ist allerdings nicht zwingend. Nicht zuletzt die Erfahrungen mit dem Faschismus und Nationalsozialismus zeigen, dass Kapitalismus und Demokratie - selbst in ihrer bürgerlichen Form - keineswegs so eng verbunden sind, wie heute gerne unterstellt wird. Ein Blick über die kapitalistischen Zentren hinaus in die Regionen, in denen halbwegs entwickelte kapitalistische Strukturen, aber kaum demokratische Verhältnisse anzutreffen sind, bestätigt dies ebenfalls. Der Zusammenhang von Kapitalismus, Nationalstaat und Demokratie ist zwar eng, jedoch keineswegs logisch oder strukturell notwendig. Er bleibt höchst widersprüchlich und umkämpft. Die Unterschiede in der konkreten ökonomischen Entwicklung der einzelnen Länder, ihrer jeweiligen Position innerhalb des kapitalistischen Weltsystems, ihrer sozialen Strukturen, den Organisationsformen und politischen Strategien der verschiedenen Klassen begründen die bestehenden Differenzen bei der Entwicklung der politischen Verhältnisse. Sie fallen sofort ins Auge, wenn man etwa die westeuropäischen Länder oder die USA mit Deutschland als einem sehr spät, aber dann in beschleunigtem Tempo kapitalistisch industrialisierten Land vergleicht, in dem quasi-feudale Produktions- und Sozialstrukturen noch bis ins 20. Jahrhundert hinein eine große Bedeutung hatten. Betrachtet man die nationalstaatliche politische Verfasstheit des globalen Kapitalismus, so gewinnt dieser Widerspruch noch eine weitere Dimension. Weil die Staaten den ökonomischen, sozialen und institutionellen Rahmen für demokratische Kämpfe darstellen, blieben die Verwirklichung demokratischer Prinzipien - Gleichheit aller Menschen, Rechtsförmigkeit der sozialen Beziehungen, allgemeine Freiheit, kurz die Menschenrechte - selbst in ihrer widersprüchlichen und unvollständigen Entwicklung an diese gebunden. Daran finden sie bis heute ihre Schranke. Wirksam sind sie nur als »Staatsbürgerrechte« und jenseits der staatlichen Grenzen bleiben sie nach wie vor weitgehend Anspruch und Fiktion - soweit sie nicht überhaupt nur zur Legitimation staatlicher Machtstrategien herhalten müssen. Das Verhältnis der Staaten untereinander bleibt im Prinzip von Abhängigkeit, Gewalt und Krieg geprägt. Unterdrückung und die Herrschaft der Stärkeren konnten hier nur eingeschränkt begrenzt und durch internationale Institutionen und Rechtsverhältnisse höchstens ansatzweise eingehegt werden. Die einigermaßen gesicherte und wie auch immer relative Geltung von Menschenrechten bleibt praktisch bis heute auf eine kleine Zahl ökonomisch und politisch herrschender Staaten beschränkt. Die Geschichte des Kapitalismus ist durch eine Reihe großer, »säkularer« Krisen gekennzeichnet, die von kleineren konjunkturellen Störungen des Wirtschaftskreislaufs unterschieden werden müssen und die grundlegende Umbrüche in den gesellschaftlichen Verhältnissen nach sich gezogen haben. Nach der »großen Depression« in den 1870er Jahren waren dies im 20. Jahrhundert die Weltwirtschaftskrisen der 1930er und 1970er Jahre. Ihre Folgen waren tiefgreifende gesellschaftliche Umwälzungen, zuletzt der Zusammenbruch des »fordistischen« Nachkriegskapitalismus und die neoliberale Globalisierungsoffensive. Damit hat sich nicht nur das Gesicht des Kapitalismus erheblich gewandelt, sondern auch die Struktur und Funktionsweise des Staates. Will man die Veränderungen des Staates und des Staatensystems untersuchen, so muss zunächst einmal gefragt werden, wie es zu diesen säkularen Krisenprozessen kommt, aus denen die unterschiedlichen kapitalistischen Formationen hervorgehen.”翻译为中文","completion":"自18世纪以来，随着现代资本主义社会的形成而确立的民主形式，在某种程度上可以被称为“资产阶级”或“自由主义”民主。资本主义的社会形态及其相应的政治形式构成了它的基础，并同时标志着它的局限性。与该术语的字面含义相反，它绝不意味着全面的民众统治。更恰当的说法是，它可以被视为一个分权制度 - 在政党、企业、国家官僚机构等之间 - 有着一定民主参与机会的系统。约瑟夫·熊彼特非常贴切地将这种民主定义为一种国家形式，其中不同的权力集团定期竞争选民的支持，从而说明了它在某种程度上反映了资本主义市场经济的结构，其中“消费者主权”显然有其局限性（熊彼特 1950）。这种限制的理论依据在于认为，完全的人民主权会导致多数人的独裁，或者声称代表多数意愿的政党，从而形成威胁个人自由的极权政治制度。其实践基础则是资本主义生产关系。保证这些关系不被民主多数决策所废除，是“资产阶级”民主特有的代议制和分权程序的目的所在。与早期情形相比，它的确在实现普遍自由和平等方面代表了进步。然而，这种进步有明显的局限性。到目前为止，它仅限于世界的某些地区，并且也在那里遇到了由社会不平等造成的障碍，例如父权制统治结构，尤其是资本主义的生产和财产关系。也就是说，自由、平等和自决在自由民主内部的实现，在结构上始终基于社会不自由、不平等和被异化。 一般来说，政治状况，如自由民主的形成，不是一个封闭的状态，而是一个充满社会对立和冲突的战场。这引出了一个问题，即是否有可能将民主发展超出现有形式。这涉及是否有可能在实践中兑现资产阶级民主内在的、但在资本主义条件下无法实现的原则，发展出一个真正实现了普遍自由、平等、个性和自决要求的政治共同体。这首先意味着，现存民主及其理论基础必须根据在长期斗争中发展起来但由于其背后的社会关系而从未实现的准则和原则进行批判性评估。与普遍观点相反，认为冷战结束和体制竞争的终结标志着历史和社会可塑性的终结，我们应该将资产阶级-自由民主视为在特定条件下产生的可变形式。面对明显倾向于退化至民主关系历史上曾达到的水平以下的发展，变革的问题显得尤为突出。当前问题在于，全球化的设计在破坏现有的自由民主结构。因此，在历史新境况下，资本主义与民主的兼容性问题以一种加剧的形式提出。 回顾资产阶级民主的历史，资本主义、现代国家和民主政治关系之间似乎存在密切联系。某种程度上，可以将自由代议民主视为资本主义的政治形式，因为其发展为其实现创造了物质条件，并且同时它是一种调节阶级关系的形式，这是系统存在的前提条件。然而，这种联系并非必然。特别是通过对法西斯主义和国家社会主义的经验，我们可以看到，资本主义与民主——即使是其资产阶级形式——并不像今天常被假设的那样紧密相连。放眼于资本主义中心之外的地区，在那些发展中的资本主义结构与民主关系几乎不存在的地区，也证实了这一点。资本主义、国家和民主之间虽然联系紧密，但并非逻辑上或结构上必然。这种联系高度矛盾且处于争议之中。 各国的具体经济发展差异、它们在资本主义世界体系中的位置、社会结构、各阶级的组织形式和政治策略，构成了政治状况发展差异的原因。当比较西欧国家或美国与德国——一个资本主义工业化非常晚但然后加速进行的国家，其中准封建的生产和社会结构直到20世纪仍然非常重要——时，这些差异显而易见。考虑到全球资本主义的国家政治构成，这种矛盾又增加了一个维度。因为国家为民主斗争提供了经济、社会和制度框架，民主原则的实现——人人平等、社会关系的法律形式、普遍自由，简而言之，人权——即使在其矛盾和不完整的发展中，也局限于这些。直到今天，它们的有效性仅限于少数经济和政治上占主导地位的国家。在国家边界之外，它们仍然大多是要求和幻想——在不是被用作国家权力策略合法化的情况下。国家之间的关系原则上仍然由依赖、暴力和战争定义。压迫和强者统治在这里只能有限制地被限制，并且最多只能在国际机构和法律关系中得到初步遏制。人权的相对安全和无论如何的有效性，实际上至今仅限于一小部分经济和政治上占主导地位的国家。 资本主义的历史特征是一系列大的“世纪性”危机，这些危机必须与经济周期的小型扰动区分开来，它们引发了社会关系的根本转变。继19世纪70年代的“大萧条”之后，20世纪经历了1930年代和1970年代的世界经济危机。它们的后果是社会的深刻变革，最终是“福特主义”战后资本主义的崩溃和新自由主义全球化攻势。这不仅改变了资本主义的面貌，也改变了国家的结构和功能。要研究国家及国家系统的变化，首先需要探讨导致这些世纪性危机过程的原因，这些过程产生了不同的资本主义形式。"},{"prompt":"请将“Dabei ist der Ausgangspunkt, dass die durch soziale Widersprüche und Antagonismen geprägte kapitalistische Gesellschaft grundsätzlich instabil und krisenhaft ist. Der Kapitalismus erhält und entwickelt sich durch immer wiederkehrende Krisen hindurch. Die Herausbildung des gegenüber Ökonomie und Gesellschaft verselbständigten Staates schafft die Möglichkeit, gesellschaftliche Widersprüche im Zaum zu halten und gewaltförmig oder kompromisshaft auszugleichen. Dies ist allerdings nur eine Voraussetzung für das Eindämmen sozialer Konflikte und erklärt noch nicht, wieso die Menschen die bestehenden Verhältnisse akzeptieren und individuell wie kollektiv so handeln, dass der Akkumulationsund Verwertungsprozess des Kapitals und die gesellschaftlich-politische Ordnung insgesamt gewährleistet bleiben. In die Struktur der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft sind zwar allgemeine, den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt stützende Legitimationsmuster wie die Vorstellung vom Staat als Verkörperung des »Gemeinwohls«, die Gleichheit der Staatsbürgerinnen als Warenbesitzer oder etwa Nationalismus und Rassismus als klassenübergreifende Integrationsideologien eingeschrieben. Damit können aber noch nicht bestimmte soziale Handlungsorientierungen, spezifische Interessenlagen, die Art und Weise der Interessenartikulation und die konkreten Formen der Kompromissbildung erklärt werden. Die Frage, was der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft über ihre Konflikt- und Krisenhaftigkeit hinweg Bestand und Dauer verleiht und vor allem wie diese Stabilität angesichts der permanenten Umwälzung der ökonomischen und sozialen Strukturen erhalten werden kann, ist deshalb mit dem Verweis auf die allgemeinen Strukturmerkmale noch nicht zureichend beantwortet. Die kapitalistische Gesellschaft hat sowohl in räumlicher als auch in zeitlicher Dimension unterschiedliche Gestalten angenommen. Bezüglich der Arbeitsverhältnisse und Lebensformen, der gesellschaftlichen Strukturen, der Ordnungsvorstellungen und der politischen Herrschaftsverhältnisse sind die Zustände, die im 19. Jahrhundert geherrscht haben, von denen Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts sehr verschieden. Entsprechende Unterschiede lassen sich auch in räumlicher Hinsicht feststellen, wenn man einzelne Länder, insbesondere die des kapitalistische Zentrums und der Peripherie vergleicht. Deshalb ist ein theoretisches Instrumentarium notwendig, dass es erlaubt, diese Unterschiede und die ihnen zugrundeliegenden Entwicklungsdynamiken zu erklären. 1. Theoretischer Hintergrund: Die Theorie der Regulation Mit der Frage der Kontinuität, der Krisen und des historischen Wandels kapitalistischer Gesellschaften hat sich seit den 1980er Jahren die Theorie der Regulation beschäftigt. Diese erscheint als am besten geeignet, die Dynamik der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft, ihre Krisen und die damit verbundenen Transformationsprozesse zu verstehen. Der Regulationstheorie kommt das Verdienst zu, auf die Bedeutung unterschiedlicher Phasen der kapitalistischen Entwicklung mit den für sie jeweils charakteristischen Verwertungsstrategien, politisch-institutionellen Formen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen aufmerksam gemacht und zu deren Analyse ein zumindest vorläufiges theoretisches Konzept vorgestellt zu haben. Dies ist nicht nur im Hinblick auf die Formulierung einer ausgearbeiteten Kapitalismustheorie bedeutend, sondern hat durch die Möglichkeit einer genaueren Identifizierung historischer Kräftekonstellationen, Herrschaftsformen und Konfliktachsen auch wichtige politische Implikationen. Die Regulationstheorie ist vor dem Hintergrund der in den 1970er Jahren ausgebrochenen zweiten Weltwirtschaftskrise des 20. Jahrhunderts entwickelt worden. Sie stellt den Versuch dar, den damit verbundenen theoretischen Verunsicherungen - sowohl auf dem Feld der etablierten Nationalökonomie als auch im Umkreis der Marxschen Theorie - Rechnung zu tragen (vgl. dazu vor allem Aglietta 1976; Hirsch/Roth 1986; Boyer 1990; Lipietz 1985, 1987; Jessop 1990b, 1997; Hirsch 1990; Esser u.a. 1994). Sie stellt keine Ordnungs-, Gleichgewichts- oder Entwicklungstheorie im traditionellen Sinne dar, sondern richtet die Aufmerksamkeit auf die problematischen Bestands- und Reproduktionsbedingungen einer durch strukturelle Gegensätze zerrissenen kapitalistischen Gesellschaft. Gefragt wird, wie Gesellschaftlichkeit, d.h. die Sicherung der materiellen Versorgung und des sozialen Zusammenhalts unter kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnissen überhaupt möglich und von relativer Dauer sein kann. Die Regulationstheorie knüpft damit an die Fragestellung an, die für die klassische politische Ökonomie, also z.B. für Adam Smith oder David Ricardo noch zentral war (Cartelier/De Vroey 1988). Das Wirken des Marktmechanismus kann dies keinesfalls zureichend erklären, genau so wenig wie die Existenz des zentralisierten staatlichen Gewaltapparats eine hinreichende Voraussetzung für die Stabilität und Entwicklung der Gesellschaft ist. Die allgemeine Antwort lautet vielmehr, dass es dazu eines weit verzweigten, durch die Begriffe »Markt« und »Staat« nicht zureichend erfassbaren Komplexes gesellschaftlich-politischer Institutionen und Normen bedarf, in die alle ökonomischen und politisch-administrativen Prozesse eingebettet sind. Erst diese ermöglichen es, dass die gegensätzlichen und konfliktorischen Handlungen von Individuen, Gruppen und Klassen in Übereinstimmung mit den Bedingungen des Gesellschaftserhalts (unter kapitalistischen Verhältnissen vor allem die Kapitalverwertung) gehalten werden können. Die Sicherung der Kapitalverwertung, d.h. einer ausreichenden Profitrate, ist zwar die grundlegende Bestandsbedingung jeder kapitalistischen Gesellschaft, aber sie darf nicht als ein objektiv wirkender Mechanismus verstanden werden, dem sich soziales Verhalten einfach nur anpasst. Die Ergebnisse der widerstreitenden gesellschaftlichen Handlungen, die sich in institutionalisierten Kräfteverhältnissen, Kompromissen, Wertorientierungen und Verhaltensroutinen niederschlagen, bestimmen selbst wieder die Bedingungen der Kapitalverwertung, d.h. die konkrete Gestalt des ökonomischen Produktions- und Zirkulationsprozesses, die darin zum Ausdruck kommenden sozialen Lagen und Konfliktfronten. Die sozialen Formen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten, die für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft typisch sind: Wertform und politische Form, Zwang zur Akkumulation, Markt- und Preismechanismus usw., kommen daher immer in einer historisch spezifischen Gestalt zum Ausdruck. Die Art und Weise der materiellen Produktion und Verteilung ist demnach immer von der jeweiligen Form der Regulation sozialer Verhältnisse abhängig und umgekehrt. Die Regulationstheorie, die sich in wichtigen Teilen auf Elemente der Marxschen Theorie bezieht - auf die Unterschiede zwischen ihren wert- und preistheoretischen Varianten gehen wir hier nicht ein - und in gewisser Hinsicht als eine ihrer interessantesten Weiterentwicklungen angesehen werden kann, stellt somit nicht nur eine deutliche Alternative zu dem die ökonomische Theorie derzeit beherrschenden Neoliberalismus, sondern auch zu den aktuellen Spielarten der Modernisierungstheorie und des »methodischen Individualismus« in den Sozialwissenschaften dar. Entstehungsbedingungen und Grundlagen der Regulationstheorie Die Theorie der Regulation wurde ursprünglich von einigen französischen Wissenschaftlern insbesondere an den Universitäten Paris und Grenoble sowie im Umkreis des Centre d'Etudes Prospectives d'Eco- nomie Mathematique Appliquees a la Planification (CEPREMAP) entwickelt, die sich mit der kritischen Überprüfung herrschender wirtschaftstheoretischer und -politischer Konzepte beschäftigt haben (Waringo 1998). Historischer Hintergrund war die in den 1970er Jahren ausgebrochene Weltwirtschaftskrise und damit verbunden die Krise der bis dahin vorherrschenden keynesianischen Theorie. Mit dieser Krise wurde die Annahme einer weitgehenden politischen Steuerbarkeit und damit der Möglichkeit einer relativ krisenfreien Entwicklung des Kapitalismus praktisch widerlegt, obwohl sich an der Tatsache einer hochvermachteten und staatsinterventionistisch regulierten Wirtschaft nichts geändert hatte. Die Auseinandersetzung mit der keynesianischen Theorie verband sich mit einer Kritik an den Modellkonstruktionen der neoklassischen Wirtschaftstheorie und an dem monetaristisch-neoliberalen Marktradikalismus, der den sozialen Zusammenhang der gesellschaftlichen Produktion, gesellschaftliche Machtverhältnisse und Institutionalisierungsformen systematisch ausblendet. Bei der Konstruktion abstrakter Marktmodelle unter ebenso abstrakten Rationalitätsannahmen wird verkannt, dass ökonomische Strukturen und Prozesse immer durch soziale Beziehungen und Machtverhältnisse geprägt sind. Diese werden jedoch im theoretischen Gerüst der herrschenden Wirtschaftswissenschaft praktisch nicht berücksichtigt (vgl. Cartel- lier/De Vroey 1988; Polanyi 1990; Hogdson 1994). Wichtige theoretische Bezugspunkte der Regulationstheorie sind die institutionalistische Wirtschaftstheorie sowie die Marxsche Theorie, die in Frankreich vor allem in der von Louis Althusser geprägten strukturalistischen Variante bedeutsam war (Lipietz 1992). Dabei hat es sich als fruchtbar erwiesen, dass die Marxsche Theorie dort nie so isoliert und ghettoisiert war wie in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. In diesem Zusammenhang ist auch eine theo-retisch angeleitete sozialgeschichtliche Forschungsrichtung zu nennen, die unter dem Namen »Annales«-Schule internationale Bedeutung und Anerkennung gefunden hat.”翻译为中文","completion":"资本主义社会由于社会矛盾和对立而本质上不稳定和危机重重。资本主义通过反复出现的危机得以持续和发展。相对于经济和社会而言自治的国家的形成，创造了遏制社会矛盾，通过暴力或妥协进行调和的可能性。然而，这只是遏制社会冲突的一个前提，并未解释为何人们接受现有情况，个人和集体如何行动以确保资本的积累和增值过程，以及整个社会政治秩序的保持。资本主义社会结构中有一般性的、支持社会凝聚的合法性模式，如把国家视为“公共利益”的体现、国民作为商品所有者的平等、国家主义和种族主义作为跨阶级的整合意识形态。但这无法解释特定的社会行为取向、特定的利益状况、利益表达的方式和具体的妥协形式。问题在于，什么使得资本主义社会超越其冲突和危机性而保持持续和稳定，尤其是如何在经济和社会结构不断变革的情况下保持这种稳定，光靠提及一般的结构特征还不能充分回答。 资本主义社会在空间和时间维度上呈现出不同的形态。关于劳动关系和生活方式、社会结构、秩序理念和政治统治关系，19世纪的状况与21世纪初大不相同。从空间角度比较不同国家，尤其是资本主义中心与外围的情况时，也可以发现类似的差异。因此，需要一个理论工具来解释这些差异及其背后的发展动力。 1. 理论背景：调整理论 自1980年代以来，调整理论致力于探讨资本主义社会的连续性、危机和历史变革问题。这一理论似乎最适合于理解资本主义社会的动态、其危机及相关的转型过程。调整理论的贡献在于，它强调了不同阶段的资本主义发展及其特有的增值策略、政治-制度形式和社会力量关系，为其分析提供了至少是初步的理论概念。这不仅对于制定完整的资本主义理论意义重大，而且通过更准确地识别历史力量配置、统治形式和冲突轴心，还具有重要的政治含义。 调整理论是在20世纪70年代第二次世界经济危机背景下形成的，旨在应对与此相关的理论不确定性——无论是在传统国民经济学领域还是在马克思主义理论范畴内（参见 Aglietta 1976; Hirsch/Roth 1986; Boyer 1990; Lipietz 1985, 1987; Jessop 1990b, 1997; Hirsch 1990; Esser 等人 1994）。它并不代表传统意义上的秩序、平衡或发展理论，而是关注资本主义社会的问题性存续和生产条件，这是一种由结构性对立撕裂的社会。它询问在资本主义生产条件下，社会性，即确保物质供给和社会凝聚如何可能，并且具有相对持续性。调整理论因此回归了经典政治经济学，例如亚当·斯密或大卫·李嘉图关注的问题（Cartelier/De Vroey 1988）。市场机制无法充分解释这一点，中央集权的国家暴力机构也不是社会稳定和发展的充分前提。更一般的回答是，需要一个广泛的、不仅仅通过“市场”和“国家”这些概念就能涵盖的社会政治制度和规范复合体，所有经济和政治行政过程都嵌入其中。只有这样，相互对立和冲突的个人、团体和阶级的行为才能与社会维持的条件（在资本主义条件下特别是资本增值）保持一致。确保资本增值，即足够的利润率，虽然是任何资本主义社会的基本存续条件，但不应被理解为一个客观作用的机制，社会行为只是简单地适应它而已。社会行动的结果，体现在制度化的力量关系、妥协、价值取向和行为惯例中，自身再次决定了资本增值的条件，即经济生产和流通过程的具体形态，其中表现出来的社会位置和冲突前线。因此，对资本主义社会典型的社会形式和规律性，如价值形式和政治形式、积累强迫、市场和价格机制等，总是以历史特定的形态表现出来。物质生产和分配的方式因此总是依赖于社会关系调整形式，反之亦然。调整理论，其重要部分基于马克思主义理论元素——我们在这里不讨论其价值和价格理论变种——在某种意义上可以被视为其最有趣的进展之一，因此不仅是对当前主导经济理论即新自由主义的明显替代，也是对现代化理论和社会科学中的“方法论个体主义”当前变体的替代。 调整理论的形成背景与基础 调整理论最初由一些特别是在巴黎和格勒诺布尔大学及CEPREMAP（应用于规划的经济数学前瞻性研究中心）周围的法国学者提出，他们致力于检验主流经济理论和政策概念（Waringo 1998）。20世纪70年代世界经济危机的爆发及其引发的直至当时主导的凯恩斯主义理论的危机构成了理论的历史背景。这场危机实际上否定了经济政策可操作性的广泛假设，即资本主义能够相对无危机地发展，尽管高度权力集中和国家干预主义调节的经济事实并未改变。与凯恩斯主义理论的辩论结合了对新古典经济理论的模型构建以及那些在市场激进主义中忽视社会生产关系、社会权力关系和制度化形式的货币主义-新自由主义的批评。 在构建抽象市场模型的同时假设了同样抽象的理性假设时，人们忽视了经济结构和过程始终受到社会关系和权力关系的影响。然而，这些在主流经济学的理论框架中几乎不被考虑（参见 Cartel- lier/De Vroey 1988; Polanyi 1990; Hogdson 1994）。制度主义经济理论以及马克思主义理论是调整理论的重要理论参照点，后者在法国主要是以路易·阿尔都塞塑造的结构主义变体的形式影响显著（Lipietz 1992）。在这个背景下，马克思主义理论从未像在德国联邦共和国中那样被孤立和隔离。在此背景下，应该提到的是一个理论引导的社会历史研究方向，以“年鉴”学派的名字获得了国际意义和认可。"},{"prompt":"请将“Bei genauerem Hinsehen kann man allerdings kaum von einer einheitlichen »Regulationsschule« sprechen, sondern es existiert eine Vielzahl von Ansätzen, die sich jedoch in zentralen Fragestellungen und Grundkonzeptionen ähneln (vgl. dazu Jessop 1990b). Soweit sich die RegulationstheoretikerInnen ausdrücklich auf die Marxsche Kritik der politischen Ökonomie beziehen, vertreten sie eine ganz spezifische Interpretation dieser Theorie. Es wird nämlich davon ausgegangen, dass es weder eine sich linear in der Geschichte durchsetzende »Logik« der kapitalistischen Entwicklung noch ein »reines«, aus abstrakten Kategorien ableitbares Wirken des Wertgesetzes gibt. Beide sind vielmehr immer schon politisch, durch das Handeln widersprüchlicher gesellschaftlicher Akteure und dessen Verdichtung in einem Komplex sozialer Institutionen bedingt und geformt. Gleichwohl unterliegt jedes soziale Handeln strukturellen, in den materiellen Produktionsverhältnissen wurzelnden Bedingungen und Zwängen. Die Regulationstheorie versucht, das Verhältnis von objektiver gesell-schaftlicher Struktur und bewusstem sozialem Handeln - eine problematische Leerstelle nicht nur in der Marxschen Theorietradition - theoretisch neu zu fassen. Eine ihrer Grundannahmen besteht also darin, dass der gesellschaftliche Entwicklungsprozess nicht allein mit Hilfe allgemeiner kapitalismus-theoretischer Begriffe und Kategorien untersucht und erklärt werden kann. Die durch sie abstrakt bestimmten Strukturen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten kommen nämlich immer in einer historisch besonderen, durch soziale Kräfteverhältnisse, institutionelle Konfigurationen, kulturelle Bedingungen und die politisch-strategischen Orientierungen handelnder Akteure geprägten Form zum Ausdruck. Dies macht es notwendig, ein Analyse- und Begriffsinstrumentarium zu entwickeln, das ermöglicht, jenseits der allgemeinen Strukturen und Gesetzmäßigkeiten kapitalistischer Gesellschaften ihre konkreten historischen Formationen zu erfassen. Dazu dienen der Regulationstheorie vor allem die als »intermediär« bezeichneten Kategorien des Akkumulationsregimes und der Regulationsweise. Im Vergleich zu den ursprünglichen regulationstheoretischen Ansätzen verwenden wir hier ein etwas erweitertes Konzept. Dies betrifft vor allem die Einbeziehung der materialistischen Staatstheorie, mit der ein oft kritisierter blinder Fleck der Regulationstheorie beseitigt werden soll. Eine weitere Kritik bezog sich auf ihre Beschränkung auf den einzelstaatlichen Rahmen, was erhebliche Schwierigkeiten mit sich bringt, die Strukturen und Dynamiken des Kapitalismus als Weltsystem zu begreifen (vgl. z.B. Röttger 1995, 1997; Alnasseri u.a. 2001; Robles 1994). Deshalb wird versucht, diese Dimension zu integrieren. Schließlich wird eine weitere Fassung des Begriffs Akkumulationsregime verwendet, die die gesellschaftlichen Naturverhältnisse, die Formen der Produktion und Aneignung von Wissen, die Geschlechterverhältnisse und das Raum-Zeit-Verhältnis mit einbezieht. Die Regulation kapitalistischer Gesellschaften Grundlegend für jede kapitalistische Gesellschaft ist der Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals, der durch eine bestimmte Form der Mehrwertproduktion (abhängig von der Produktionstechnik, der Arbeits- und Unternehmensorganisation, den Klassen- und Marktverhältnissen usw.), die Verteilung der produzierten Werte auf soziale Gruppen und Klassen, die Lebensweisen und Konsummuster, eine damit verbundene Gliederung der Branchen und Sektoren (z.B. Verhältnis von Konsumgüter- zu Pro-duktionsmittelindustrie) sowie eine spezifische Verbindung »kapitalistischer« und »nichtkapitalistischer« (z.B. kleinhandwerkliche und kleinbäuerliche Produktion sowie Hausarbeit) gekennzeichnet ist. Der Akkumulationsprozess weist dann eine relative Stabilität und Dauerhaftigkeit auf, wenn er in ein Netz gesellschaftlicher Institutionen und Normen eingebettet ist, die dafür sorgen, dass sich die Menschen in Übereinstim-mung mit seinen Bedingungen verhalten, also entsprechende Arbeits-, Lebens- und Konsumweisen sowie bestimmte Formen der Interessenwahrnehmung praktizieren. Er muss also mit einem System der gesellschaftlichen Regulation verbunden sein. Die Art und Weise der Akkumulation und Regulation bleibt in der geschichtlichen Entwicklung des Kapitalismus nicht gleich, sondern nimmt - angetrieben durch die krisenhafte Dynamik des Akkumulationsprozesses und die damit verbundenen sozialen Auseinandersetzungen und Konflikte - unterschiedliche Formen an. Die historisch verschiedenen Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen kennzeichnen sowohl in zeitlicher als auch in räumlicher Hinsicht die jeweiligen »Gesichter« der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft. Mit dem Begriff Akkumulationsregime wird ein bestimmter Modus der Produktion bezeichnet, »der über eine längere Periode hinweg ein Ent-sprechungsverhältnis zwischen den materiellen Produktionsbedingungen und ihrer Entwicklung (d.h. dem Volumen des eingesetzten Kapitals, der branchenmäßigen Struktur des Produktionsapparats sowie den Produkti-onsnormen) sowie dem gesellschaftlichen Verbrauch (Konsumausgaben der Lohnabhängigen und anderer Klassen, kollektiver, d.h. durch »sozial«-staat- liche Maßnahmen vermittelter Konsum) gewährleistet.« (Lipietz 1985,120) Kapitalakkumulation findet nur dann statt, wenn eine ausreichende Rate und Masse des Mehrwerts bzw. Profits erzeugt wird. Sonst würde der Kapitalismus zusammenbrechen. Dies ist allerdings in unterschiedlicher Weise möglich und von vorhandenen Technologien und sozialen Kräfte-verhältnissen abhängig. Der Begriff des Akkumulationsregimes enthält darüber hinaus ein ebenso bestimmtes wie veränderliches Verhältnis ka-pitalistischer und nichtkapitalistischer Produktionsverhältnisse und - wie noch ausführlicher gezeigt werden wird - eine spezifische Verbindung zwischen dem »nationalen« Produktions- und Reproduktionszusammenhang und dem Weltmarkt. Abstrakt gesprochen kennzeichnet ein Akkumulationsregime nichts anderes als die »formale Kohärenz« der Wertströme (ebd.) einer in den Weltmarkt eingebundenen Ökonomie, die unter der objektiven Bedingung der Kapitalverwertung steht und in seiner jeweiligen Gestalt durch spezifische soziale Kräfteverhältnisse bestimmt wird. Der Zusammenhang von Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweise kann an einem Beispiel erläutert werden. Wenn die Kapitalverwertung auf der Verallgemeinerung der Warenproduktion, der Ausbreitung regulärer Lohnarbeit, Massenproduktion und Massenkonsum beruht - was nicht immer der Fall war und nur eine kurze Periode der kapitalistischen Entwicklung gekennzeichnet hat -, dann bedarf es sozialer Institutionen und Normen, die dieses ökonomische Verhältnis abstützen, also beispielsweise für allgemeine Arbeitsdisziplin, stabile und stetig steigende Lohneinkommen und soziale Sicherungssysteme als Mittel der Konsumstabilisierung sorgen. Historisch war dies in der Ära des Fordismus um die Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts der Fall, die zumindest in den kapitalistischen Zentren durch Konsumismus, »Wachstum« und »Fortschritt« als beherrschende Werte, starke Gewerkschaften, sozialpartnerschaftliche Aushandlungsprozesse und ein ausgebautes Netz sozialstaatlicher Sicherungen gekennzeichnet war. Lipietz definiert Regulationsweise demnach als »die Gesamtheit institutioneller Formen, Netze, expliziter oder impliziter Normen, die die Vereinbarkeit von Verhältnissen im Rahmen eines Akkumulationsregimes sichern, und zwar sowohl entsprechend dem Zustand der gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse als auch über deren konfliktuelle Eigenschaften hinaus.« (ebd., 121) Dazu gehören die Unternehmen und ihre Verbände, Gewerkschaften, Wissenschafts- und Bildungseinrichtungen, Medien, die gesamte Apparatur des politisch-administrativen Systems und nicht zuletzt die Familie als Ort der Reproduktion der Arbeitskraft. Es umfasst ein komplexes Netzwerk sozialer und kultureller Organisationen und Zusammenhänge, in denen sich die bestimmenden gesellschaftlichen Verhaltensmuster und entsprechende Ordnungs- und Entwicklungsvorstellungen herausbilden. Wie schon für das Akkumulationsregime gilt auch hier, dass es zwar unterschiedliche Regulationsweisen gibt, ihre Herausbildung aber nicht beliebig ist. Ebenso wie das Akkumulationsregime unterliegt auch die Regulationsweise strukturellen Bestimmungen. Sie wird geprägt von den für den Kapitalismus charakteristischen sozialen Formen und sie ist daran gebunden, dass der Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals im Rahmen eines entsprechenden Akkumulationsregimes gewährleistet bleibt. Mit Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweise werden demnach nicht in sich abgeschlossene und nur äußerlich miteinander verbundene gesellschaftliche Räume oder Ebenen bezeichnet, sondern spezifische Praxisgusammenhänge, die durch jeweils eigene strukturelle Bedingungen, Regelmäßigkeiten, soziale Formen und Handlungsmöglichkeiten gekennzeichnet sind.”翻译为中文","completion":"然而，仔细观察可以发现，很难说存在一个统一的“调整学派”，而是有许多不同的方法，这些方法在核心问题和基本概念上有所相似（参见Jessop 1990b）。在明确参照马克思的政治经济学批判方面，调整理论持有这一理论的一种非常特定的解释。 它认为，既不存在在历史上线性实现的资本主义发展的“逻辑”，也不存在从抽象类别中派生出的“纯粹”价值法则的作用。这两者都已经受到了政治因素的影响，由相互矛盾的社会行为者的行动以及这些行动在社会制度复合体中的凝聚所决定和塑造。尽管如此，每一个社会行动都受到根植于物质生产关系中的结构性条件和强制的影响。 调整理论试图重新理解客观社会结构和有意识的社会行动之间的关系——这在马克思主义理论传统中一直是一个问题领域。 因此，它的一个基本假设是，社会发展过程不能仅仅通过一般的资本主义理论概念和类别来研究和解释。因为由它们抽象定义的结构和规律性总是以一种受到社会力量关系、制度配置、文化条件和行动者的政治策略取向塑造的特殊历史形式表现出来。这就需要发展一种分析和概念工具，使得能够在超越资本主义社会的一般结构和规律性之外，把握它们的具体历史形式。为此，调整理论主要用到了被称为“中介”的类别，如积累制度和调整方式。 与最初的调整理论方法相比，我们在这里采用了一个稍微扩展的概念。这主要涉及到物质主义国家理论的引入，旨在消除调整理论的一个经常被批评的盲点。另一个批评集中在其限定在单一国家框架上，这在理解资本主义作为世界体系的结构和动态方面带来了重大困难（参见Röttger 1995, 1997; Alnasseri等人2001; Robles 1994）。因此，试图整合这一维度。最后，使用了一个更广泛的积累制度概念，包括社会自然关系、生产和知识占有形式、性别关系以及时空关系。 资本主义社会的调整 每个资本主义社会的基础是资本的积累过程，这个过程以特定的剩余价值生产形式（取决于生产技术、劳动和企业组织、阶级和市场关系等）、生产的价值在社会群体和阶级之间的分配、生活方式和消费模式、相应的行业和部门结构（例如，消费品工业与生产资料工业的关系）以及“资本主义”和“非资本主义”（例如，小工业和小农业生产以及家庭劳动）特定联系为特征。当积累过程嵌入于一个确保人们行为符合其条件的社会制度和规范网络中时，这个过程就显示出相对的稳定性和持久性，即要求实践特定的劳动、生活和消费方式以及特定的利益表达形式。因此，它必须与社会调整的系统相连。积累和调整的方式在资本主义的历史发展中并不是不变的，而是随着积累过程的危机性动态以及由此引发的社会斗争和冲突采取不同的形式。历史上不同的积累制度和调整方式标志着资本主义社会在时间和空间上的各个“面孔”。 积累制度这一概念指的是一种特定的生产模式，“在较长时期内确保了物质生产条件及其发展（即投入资本的量、生产设备的行业结构及生产规范）与社会消费（工资劳动者和其他阶级的消费支出，通过‘社会’-国家措施调节的集体即‘社会’消费）之间的相应关系。”（Lipietz 1985,120） 资本积累仅在产生足够率和量的剩余价值即利润时发生。否则，资本主义将崩溃。这可以通过不同的方式并取决于现有技术和社会力量关系来实现。积累制度的概念还包括资本主义和非资本主义生产关系的同样特定而变化的关系，如稍后将详细说明的，特定的国家生产和再生产联系与世界市场之间的关系。抽象地说，积累制度表示入世界市场的经济的价值流的“正式一致性”，这是在资本增值的客观条件下，并由特定社会力量关系决定的。 通过一个例子可以说明积累制度和调整方式之间的联系。如果资本增值依赖于商品生产的普遍化、正规工资劳动的扩展、大规模生产和消费——这并非总是如此，只标志了资本主义发展的短暂时期——那么就需要社会制度和规范来支持这种经济关系，例如保证普遍的劳动纪律、稳定且持续提高的工资收入和作为消费稳定化手段的社会保障系统。历史上，在20世纪中叶的福特主义时代，尤其是在资本主义中心，以消费主义、“增长”和“进步”作为主导价值观，强大的工会、社会伙伴合作的谈判过程和完善的社会保障网络为特征。 Lipietz将调整方式定义为“保障积累制度框架内关系一致性的全部制度形式、网络、明确或隐含的规范的总和，既符合社会关系的状态，也超越其冲突性质。”（同上，121）这包括企业及其协会、工会、科学和教育机构、媒体、整个政治行政系统，以及作为劳动力再生产地点的家庭。它包括一个复杂的社会和文化组织和联系网络，在其中形成了主导的社会行为模式以及相应的秩序和发展观念。正如积累制度一样，尽管存在不同的调整方式，但其形成并非任意。正如积累制度一样，调整方式也受到结构性的决定。它受到对资本主义典型的社会形式的影响，且受限于在相应积累制度框架内确保资本积累过程的必要性。因此，积累制度和调整方式并不指代封闭且仅表面相连的社会空间或层面，而是指特定的实践背景，这些背景由各自的结构性条件、规律性、社会形式和行动可能性所定义。"},{"prompt":"请将“Jede historische kapitalistische Gesellschaftsformation erhält ihre vor-übergehende Stabilität durch eine einander entsprechende Akkumulat- ions- und Regulationsweise. Dadurch ergibt sich eine bestimmte gesellschaftliche Entwicklungsweise. Diese ist jeweils durch eigene Gesetz- und Regelmäßigkeiten gekennzeichnet. Hervorzuheben ist, dass Akkumula-tionsregimes und Regulationsweisen in keinem einfachen Verursachungs-verhältnis stehen. Sie sind nicht voneinander »ableitbar«. Weder bringt ein Akkumulationsregime mit Notwendigkeit die ihm entsprechende Regulationsweise hervor, noch umgekehrt. Ein stabiles Akkumulationsregime kann sich allerdings nur herausbilden, wenn sich zugleich ein entsprechender Regulationszusammenhang durchsetzt. Beides muss als Ergebnis sozialer Auseinandersetzungen und Kämpfe auf verschiedenen gesellschaftlichen Ebenen betrachtet werden, deren Ausgang nicht objektiv vorbestimmt ist, sondern von der Stärke, den Strategien und Erfolgen der beteiligten Akteure abhängt. Dadurch ist ein variables Gefüge unterschiedlicher Akkumulationsregimes und Regulationsweisen möglich. Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen stehen also nicht in einem kausalen oder funktionalen, sondern in einem Verbindungs- oder Artikulationsverhältnis. Sie müssen als Verknüpfung komplexer und relativ selbstständiger Handlungs- und Praxiszusammenhänge betrachtet werden. Insofern hat Lipietz Recht, wenn er die verschiedenen bisher entstandenen kapitalistischen Formationen als »Fundsachen« bezeichnet. Diese Formulierung bezieht sich darauf, dass die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus ein grundsätzlich offener Prozess ohne vordefinierten Ausgang ist. Ob sich aus der Krise einer vorhandenen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise eine neue herausbildet, wie diese aussieht und als wie stabil sie sich erweist, ist das Ergebnis sozialer Handlungen und Kämpfe. Inwieweit die kapitalistische Gesellschaft sich über Krisen und Brüche hinweg immer wieder neu stabilisiert, krisenhaft zusammenbricht oder aber politisch überwunden wird, ist nicht das Ergebnis einer objektiven Gesetzmäßigkeit, sondern muss als eine Folge sozialen Handelns betrachtet werden. Dieses ist allerdings innerhalb kapitalistischer Verhältnisse nicht frei und beliebig wählbar, sondern bleibt strukturellen Bedingungen und sozialen Formbestimmungen unterworfen. Wenn der Akkumulations- und Verwertungsprozess des Kapitals unterbrochen wird, steht der Bestand der Gesellschaft überhaupt, die Arbeitsplätze ebenso wie die materielle Existenz in Frage und bestimmte soziale Formen, wie sie sich beispielsweise in der Gestalt des Staates ausdrücken, sind nicht zu beseitigen, solange die kapitalistische Gesellschaftsstruktur bestehen bleibt. Staat und Zivilgesellschaft Stabilere Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen haben sich bisher in der Regel innerhalb einzelstaatlicher Räume gebildet, weil innerhalb dieses zentralisierten Machtzusammenhangs am ehesten die soziokulturellen Voraussetzungen für das Entstehen gemeinsamer Wert- und Ordnungsvorstellungen sowie darauf gegründeter sozialer Kompromissbildungen gegeben sind. Vor allem existieren nur hier die institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen - Beteiligungsregeln, Entscheidungsverfahren usw. -, durch die diese wirksam werden können (Lipietz 1985). Weil Regulation aus dem Zusammenspiel unterschiedlicher und relativ voneinander unabhängiger Institutionen und Prozesse entsteht, hat sie zwar kein steuerndes Subjekt, besitzt im Staat jedoch ein institutionelles Zentrum, weil die physische Zwangsgewalt Grundlage für den Erhalt der Klassenverhältnisse, ihrer sozialen Formen und institutionellen Aus-drucksweisen ist und weil soziale Kompromisse nur dort verbindlich fest-geschrieben werden können. Falsch wäre indessen die Annahme, der Staat steuere die Gesellschaft. Vielmehr garantiert er den Prozess der Regulation mit Hilfe seiner Zwangsmittel und ist zugleich selbst Gegenstand der Regulation, weil sich sein institutionelles Gefüge entsprechend der Ak-kumulationsbedingungen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse ebenfalls verändert (Jessop 1990a, 367ff.). Diese führen immer auch zu Modifikationen im Netzwerk des politischen Systems, d.h. im Verhältnis der administrativen Apparate zueinander, in den Formen der Repräsentation oder der Art und Weise parteilicher oder verbandsförmiger Interessenvermittlung (Jessop 1982, 238ff.). Die konkrete Gestalt des Staates, das bestimmte Verhältnis von »Staat« und »Gesellschaft«, die Form staatlicher Interventionen und die Institutionalisierung gesellschaftlicher Beziehungen sind also nicht festgeschrieben, sondern verändern sich mit den Bedingungen der Regulation. Damit lässt sich auch das Verhältnis von »Politik« und »Ökonomie«, von »Staat« und »Wirtschaft« genauer bestimmen. Es gibt keinen ökonomischen Bereich unabhängig von Regulation und Staat. Der Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals ist immer schon in die Regulation mit dem Staat als institutionellem Zentrum eingebunden, auch wenn sich dessen Funktion und Bedeutung entsprechend des jeweiligen Akkumulationsregimes und der Regulationsweise historisch verändern. Und zugleich bleibt Regulation abhängig von Verlauf und Entwicklung des Akkumulationsprozesses. Die Vorstellung, die »Politik« steuere die »Wirtschaft« - oder umgekehrt -, ist daher grundsätzlich falsch. »Akkumulation« und »Regulation« bilden eine durch jeweils eigene soziale Praxen und Dynamiken bestimmte und somit widersprüchliche Einheit. Analog zum Begriff des »integralen Staates« bei Gramsci könnte man bei der Regulationstheorie von einem Konzept der »integralen Ökonomie« sprechen. Oder anders ausgedrückt kann sie deutlich machen, was der Begriff »politische Ökonomie« eigentlich heißt (Jessop 1990a; Delor- me 1992). Wichtig ist, dass Regulation nicht nur auf dem Einsatz staatlicher Gewaltmittel beruht, sondern immer eines gewissen gesellschaftlichen Konsenses und einer freiwilligen Folgebereitschaft bedarf, um einigermaßen dauerhaft zu sein. Wenn Max Weber den Staat als Inhaber des Monopols legitimer physischer Gewaltsamkeit bezeichnet, so verweist er - wie später vor allem Gramsci - auf den engen Zusammenhang von Zwang und Konsens in jedem Herrschaftsverhältnis (Gramsci 1986, 199ff.). Die Durchsetzung relativ stabiler Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhänge ist daher an eine politisch-ideologische Hegemonie gebunden. Schon die Form des Staates als von der Gesellschaft, ihren sozialen Antagonismen und Klassen formell getrennte, den individualisierten Staatsbürgerinnen verselbständigt gegenübertretende Instanz ist eine entscheidende Grundlage der politischen Legitimation. Dadurch kann der Staat als ein neutraler Sachwalter des »Gemeinwohls« wahrgenommen werden. Unter bürgerlich-demokratischen Verhältnissen erweist sich dieser Legitimationszusammenhang in der Regel als besonders wirksam. Indem der Prozess der Regulation den Klassenkonflikt in eine mit der Akkumulation des Kapitals verträgliche Form bringt und eben dadurch den materiellen Produktionsprozess stabilisiert, rechtfertigt er sich bei den betroffenen Menschen gewissermaßen fortwährend selbst. Krisen der Regulation tragen daher immer die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Krisen des Staates, des politischen Systems und der Hegemonie in sich.”翻译为中文","completion":"然而，仔细观察后，很难说有一个统一的“调整学派”，而是存在着许多不同的方法，这些方法在核心问题和基本概念上有所相似（参见Jessop 1990b）。那些明确引用马克思的政治经济学批判的调整理论学者，代表了这一理论的一种非常特定的解释。 他们认为，既不存在贯穿历史的资本主义发展的线性“逻辑”，也不存在从抽象类别中直接推演出的价值法则的“纯粹”作用。两者实际上都受到了政治因素的影响，是由相互矛盾的社会行动者的行为及其在社会制度复合体中的凝聚所决定和塑造的。尽管如此，每一种社会行为都受到根植于物质生产关系中的结构性条件和强制的制约。 调整理论试图重新阐述客观社会结构和有意识的社会行动之间的关系——这在马克思主义理论传统中一直是一个问题领域。 因此，它的一个基本假设是，社会发展过程不能仅仅依靠一般资本主义理论的概念和类别来研究和解释。因为这些概念和类别所定义的抽象结构和规律性总是以一种特殊的历史形式、受社会力量关系、制度配置、文化条件和行动者的政治策略取向影响而表现出来。这就需要发展一种分析工具和概念体系，能够在超越资本主义社会的一般结构和规律性之外，把握其具体的历史形态。为此，调整理论主要采用了所谓的“中介”类别，如积累制度和调整方式。 与最初的调整理论方法相比，我们在这里采用了一个稍微扩展的概念。这主要体现在引入唯物主义国家理论，这一点意在消除调整理论经常被批评的盲点。另一个批评涉及到其限定在单一国家框架的问题，这在理解资本主义作为世界体系的结构和动态方面带来了实质性困难（参见例如Röttger 1995, 1997; Alnasseri等人2001; Robles 1994）。因此，我们尝试整合这一维度。最后，使用了一个更广泛的积累制度概念，这一概念包括了社会自然关系、知识的生产和占有形式、性别关系以及时空关系。 资本主义社会的调整 每个历史上的资本主义社会形态通过相对应的积累和调整方式获得短暂稳定性。因此产生了特定的社会发展方式，每种方式都有其自己的法则和规律性。需要强调的是，积累制度和调整方式之间并不存在简单的因果关系。它们不能简单地从彼此中“推导”出来。一个积累制度既不必然产生相对应的调整方式，反之亦然。然而，一个稳定的积累制度只有在相应的调整结构得以确立时才能形成。两者都必须被视为社会斗争和战斗在不同社会层面上的结果，其结果并非客观预定的，而取决于参与行动者的力量、策略和成功。因此，不同的积累制度和调整方式的组合是可能的。积累制度和调整方式之间不是因果或功能上的，而是联系或结合上的关系。它们必须被看作是由各自独特的社会实践和动力学所定义的复杂且相对独立的行动和实践构成的。 在这种意义上，利皮茨（Lipietz）将不同的现有资本主义形态称为“发现物”是正确的。这一表述指出资本主义的发展是一个基本上开放的、没有预定义结果的过程。一种新的积累和调整方式如何从既有制度的危机中产生，其具体形态和稳定性如何，是社会行为和斗争的结果。资本主义社会如何能够跨越危机和断裂而不断重新稳定、危机性崩溃或被政治超越，并非由客观规律决定，而应视为社会行为的结果。然而，在资本主义条件下，这种行为并非自由和任意选择的，而是受制于结构性条件和社会形态规定。如果资本的积累和增值过程中断，那么社会的存续、工作岗位以及物质生存就会受到质疑，而特定的社会形式，如国家的形态，只要资本主义社会结构存在，就无法消除。 国家和民间社会 更稳定的积累制度和调整方式通常是在单一国家空间内形成的，因为这个中央集中的权力结构最有可能为产生共同的价值和秩序观念以及基于此的社会妥协形成提供社会文化前提。特别是只有在这里才存在制度化的框架条件——参与规则、决策程序等，这些条件使得这些体系能够有效地运作（Lipietz 1985）。因为调整是由不同且相对独立的机构和过程相互作用产生的，虽然它没有一个指导主体，但在国家中却有一个制度中心，因为物理暴力是维护阶级关系、其社会形式和制度化表现的基础，也因为只有在这里社会妥协才能被强制性地定型。然而，假设国家管理着社会将是错误的。相反，国家通过其强制手段保障了调整过程，并且同样也是调整的对象，因为根据积累条件和社会力量关系的变化，其制度构成也在变化（Jessop 1990a, 367ff）。这导致政治系统网络中的变化，即行政机构之间的关系、代表形式或政党和社团利益调节方式的变化（Jessop 1982, 238ff）。国家的具体形态、\\"国家\\"和\\"社会\\"之间的特定关系、国家干预的形式以及社会关系的制度化都不是一成不变的，而是随着调整条件的变化而变化。 这也使得\\"政治\\"与\\"经济\\"、\\"国家\\"与\\"市场\\"之间的关系可以更加准确地界定。不存在独立于调整和国家的经济领域。资本的积累过程总是已经被嵌入到以国家为制度中心的调整中的，尽管其功能和意义会根据特定的积累制度和调整方式而在历史上变化。同时，调整始终依赖于积累过程的进程和发展。因此，\\"政治\\"管理\\"经济\\"或反之的观念基本上是错误的。\\"积累\\"和\\"调整\\"构成了一个由各自独特的社会实践和动力学所定义的、因此充满矛盾的统一体。 类似于格拉西的\\"整体国家\\"概念，我们可以将调整理论视为\\"整体经济\\"的概念。或者换句话说，它可以清晰地说明\\"政治经济学\\"这个术语实际上意味着什么（Jessop 1990a；Delorme 1992）。重要的是，调整不仅依赖于国家强制力的使用，而且始终需要一定程度的社会共识和自愿遵从，以确保其的相对长期稳定。当马克斯·韦伯将国家定义为合法物理暴力垄断者时，他——正如格拉西后来尤其强调的那样——指出了每种统治关系中强制和共识的紧密联系（格拉西 1986，199ff）。因此，相对稳定的积累和调整结构的实现依赖于政治-意识形态的霸权。国家作为一个与社会、其社会对立和阶级关系形式上分离、对个体化的国民独立对峙的实体，本身就是政治合法性的一个决定性基础。这使得国家可以被视为\\"公共利益\\"的中立代表。在资产阶级民主条件下，这种合法性结构通常特别有效。通过将阶级冲突引入与资本积累兼容的形式，从而稳定物质生产过程，调整过程在受影响的人群中不断自我证明其正当性。因此，调整危机总是带有国家、政治系统和霸权危机的可能性。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are the key points extracted from the responses: 1. **Positive Autonomy in Tasks:** Many employees appreciate the autonomy they receive in performing tasks, specifically in testing and DevOps, as well as in development roles. They feel they have the freedom to decide how to complete specific tasks and are encouraged to share their advice and feedback with team members. 2. **Supportive Team Environment:** Respondents note the supportive nature of their teams, highlighting that they feel comfortable expressing their opinions and suggestions, which are respectfully considered by their colleagues. 3. **Challenges and Dependencies:** While there is a sense of freedom, employees also mention facing dependencies in their projects, which can limit their autonomy to some degree. These dependencies are related to technical limitations (tools and components), project upgrades (such as IICS upgrades affecting programs and codes), and the inherent nature of cross-team collaboration. 4. **Desire for Guidance:** A few responses express a need for more guidance, especially when encountering new technical challenges, indicating that while autonomy is valued, balanced guidance and clearer specifications (SPEC) are also critical for optimal performance and development. 5. **Mixed Feelings on Leadership and Dependency:** One respondent acknowledges the autonomy given by the team but expresses a preference for more leadership, mentioning that most dependencies they face stem from their own technical skill gaps. Another highlights the difference between personal/team dependency and design dependency, suggesting that while there's freedom in how work is done, project designs still impose certain constraints. # Insights and Common Points - **Autonomy with Support:** The feedback repeatedly emphasizes the balance between having autonomy in work and the necessary support from both the team and the managerial side. This indicates a healthy team culture that values individual input while providing a safety net for guidance. - **Technical and Cross-Team Dependencies:** A common challenge across responses is the dependencies encountered, whether due to technical limitations or the need for collaboration with other teams. This suggests a potential area for improvement in project management and technical support, ensuring that dependencies do not overly hinder autonomy. - **Communication and Respect within Teams:** A significant positive note is the level of comfort employees feel in sharing their inputs and feedback, highlighting a culture of respect and open communication within teams. This is a strong foundation for fostering innovation and continuous improvement. - **Clarification and Guidance Needs:** Despite the autonomy, there is a clear signal that employees seek clearer guidelines and more definitive leadership at times, particularly when facing new or challenging situations. This underscores the importance of maintaining a balance between granting autonomy and providing direction.

Встроенная в Windows функция не делает это правильно.","completion":"Если встроенная функция Windows для сортировки ярлыков на рабочем столе не работает должным образом или вы не удовлетворены результатами, возможно, вы столкнулись с некоторыми ограничениями или ошибками в системе. Однако, вы можете попробовать другие методы для достижения желаемой сортировки. Вот несколько альтернативных способов: 1. **Пересортировка вручную**: Если у вас не так много ярлыков, вы можете попробовать упорядочить их вручную, просто перетаскивая на желаемое место. 2. **Использование стороннего ПО**: Существует множество утилит от сторонних разработчиков, предназначенных для управления и настройки рабочего стола, включая сортировку иконок. Примеры таких программ: Fences от Stardock, Nimi Places и DesktopOK. Эти программы предлагают гораздо больше возможностей для настройки расположения ярлыков, чем стандартные функции Windows. 3. **Использование команд Windows**: - Перейдите на рабочий стол (нажмите правой кнопкой мыши на свободном пространстве). - Выберите \\"Просмотр\\" или \\"View\\". - Затем выберите \\"Сортировать по\\", а после \\"Имя\\" или \\"Name\\". Если этот метод не работает правильно, возможно, произошла ошибка в системе или в каких-то настройках. 4. **Перестройка иконок через реестр**: Можно попытаться сбросить настройки рабочего стола через редактор реестра Windows. Однако это более продвинутый метод и может быть рискованным, если вы не уверены в своих действиях. Перед внесением изменений в реестр обязательно создайте точку восстановления системы. 5. **Обращение в поддержку Windows**: Если проблема кажется аномалией и не решается стандартными методами, возможно, стоит обратиться за помощью в поддержку Microsoft. Ваш случай может быть связан с багом в обновлении или уникальной проблемой конфигурации. В зависимости от конкретной ситуации и ваших предпочтений, выберите подходящий вам метод. Сторонние программы часто предоставляют наиболее удобные и гибкие решения для управления рабочим столом, но всегда существует риск при использовании ПО, не являющегося частью официальной экосистемы Windows."},{"prompt":"Расшифруй название Kdenlive","completion":"Kdenlive расшифровывается как **KDE Non-Linear Video Editor**.

Il est possible que vous évoquiez une figure moins médiatisée ou locale dont les informations ne sont pas largement disponibles ou reconnues au niveau international. En termes généraux, pour ce qui est des routines de prière et des miracles associés dans le christianisme, divers prédicateurs et figures spirituelles peuvent s'appuyer sur plusieurs passages de la Bible. Voici quelques références bibliques courantes relatives à la prière et aux miracles: 1. **Philippiens 4:6-7** - \\"Ne vous inquiétez de rien; mais en toutes choses faites connaître vos besoins à Dieu par des prières et des supplications avec des actions de grâce. Et la paix de Dieu, qui surpasse toute intelligence, gardera vos cœurs et vos pensées en Christ Jésus.\\" 2. **Jacques 5:16** - \\"Confessez donc vos péchés les uns aux autres, et priez les uns pour les autres, afin que vous soyez guéris. La prière fervente du juste a une grande efficace.\\" 3. **Marc 11:24** - \\"C'est pourquoi je vous le dis: tout ce que vous demanderez en priant, croyez que vous l'avez reçu, et vous le verrez s'accomplir.\\" 4. **Actes 2:38** - \\"Pierre leur dit: Repentez-vous, et que chacun de vous soit baptisé au nom de Jésus Christ pour le pardon de vos péchés; et vous recevrez le don du Saint-Esprit.\\" Ces versets reflètent la croyance fondamentale dans le pouvoir de la prière, la repentance, la foi, et les miracles dans le christianisme. Les prédicateurs chrétiens peuvent s'appuyer sur ces passages et d'autres similaires pour encourager la foi et la pratique religieuse. Si vous faites référence à une figure spécifique nommée Georges Mu, il serait utile d'avoir plus d'informations pour fournir une réponse plus précise ou pour orienter votre recherche.

Il est un exemple éminent de foi et de dévotion dans l'histoire chrétienne, réputé pour sa confiance exceptionnelle en la provision et la guidance de Dieu. # Routine de Prière Georges Müller est particulièrement célèbre pour sa dépendance à la prière. Il a vécu une vie de foi remarquable, démontrant une confiance profonde dans les promesses de Dieu et la puissance de la prière. Müller ne demandait jamais directement d'argent à qui que ce soit pour soutenir son ministère; il priait Dieu et attendait que Dieu touche le cœur des gens pour pourvoir aux besoins de ses orphelinats. Sa routine de prière n'était pas simplement un aspect de sa vie; c'était le fondement même de son ministère. Il passait des heures chaque jour en prière, cherchant la direction de Diei et son soutien pour tous ses besoins. # Miracles De nombreux récits racontent comment les besoins de ses orphelinats ont été miraculeusement comblés. Un des récits les plus célèbres concernant Müller concerne une matinée où il n'y avait pas de nourriture pour les orphelins. Avec les enfants assis à table, Müller pria pour que Dieu pourvoie à leur besoin; peu après, un boulanger et un laitier frappèrent à la porte offrant du pain et du lait gratuitement, répondant à leur besoin immédiat. Ce n'est qu'un exemple parmi d'autres des nombreuses histoires où, suite à la prière, les besoins des orphelins ont été pourvus de manière inattendue et miraculeuse. # Références Bibliques Bien que les écrits spécifiques de Müller sur ses versets de prédilection ne soient pas systématiquement listés, le principe de sa vie de prière et de foi peut être soutenu par plusieurs passages bibliques, tels que : - **Philippiens 4:19** : \\"Mon Dieu pourvoira à tous vos besoins selon sa richesse, avec gloire, en Jésus Christ.\\" - **Matthieu 6:33** : \\"Cherchez premièrement le royaume et la justice de Dieu; et toutes ces choses vous seront données par-dessus.\\" - **Matthieu 7:7** : \\"Demandez, et l’on vous donnera; cherchez, et vous trouverez; frappez, et l’on vous ouvrira.\\" Müller a pris ces promesses à cœur, vivant sa vie dans une dépendance quotidienne et complète en Dieu pour le moindre de ses besoins et ceux des enfants dont il avait la charge. Son héritage perdure comme un témoignage puissant de la foi en action et du ministère centré sur la prière."},{"prompt":"Garde le même contexte les mêmes textes et rajoute l'histoire qui est racontée selon lequel il aurait fait attendre la reine d'Angleterre","completion":"Georges Müller, prédicateur chrétien et philanthrope britannique du 19ème siècle, est resté célèbre pour sa profonde foi et son dévouement à travers ses orphelinats à Bristol, en Angleterre.

Convaincu que Dieu pourvoit aux besoins de ceux qui l’invoquent, il ne faisait jamais appel à des donations publiques pour ses orphelinats, se fiant à la prière pour amener les moyens nécessaires. Des heures entières étaient consacrées quotidiennement à la prière, mettant tous les besoins et défis de son ministère entre les mains de Dieu. # Miracles Les histoires des provisions miraculeuses de Dieu en réponse à ses prières sont nombreuses, allant de la nourriture fournie inopinément pour les orphelins à des donations substantielles arrivant au moment précis de besoin. L’un des récits les plus mémorables décrit comment, n'ayant pas de nourriture pour donner aux enfants un matin, Müller pria à table avec eux, et bientôt après, un boulanger et un laitier leur fournirent suffisamment de provisions, tout cela sans que Müller n’ait informé quiconque de ce besoin spécifique. # Une Rencontre avec la Reine Une histoire remarquable liée à Georges Müller, bien que moins connue, est celle où sa foi aurait eu un impact direct sur la royauté britannique. Selon cette histoire, la reine Victoria d’Angleterre, ayant entendu parler de son travail extraordinaire auprès des orphelins, exprima le désir de le rencontrer. Cependant, lorsque la possibilité d'une rencontre devint concrète, Müller était engagé dans son moment de prière quotidien. Fidèle à ses convictions et ses routines, il aurait demandé à ce qu’on dise à la reine qu'il ne pouvait la voir jusqu'à ce qu'il ait terminé son temps de prière. Surpris mais impressionné par une telle dévotion, cette attente aurait encore plus accru l'estime de la reine pour Müller et son œuvre. Cette anecdote, qu’elle soit apocryphe ou anecdotique, illustre clairement la priorité que Müller accordait à sa vie de prière. # Références Bibliques Voici quelques versets bibliques qui auraient pu inspirer et soutenir la foi et la pratique de Müller: - **Philippiens 4:19** : \\"Mon Dieu pourvoira à tous vos besoins selon sa richesse, avec gloire, en Jésus Christ.\\" - **Matthieu 6:33** : \\"Cherchez premièrement le royaume et la justice de Dieu; et toutes ces choses vous seront données par-dessus.\\" - **Matthieu 7:7** : \\"Demandez, et l’on vous donnera; cherchez, et vous trouverez; frappez, et l’on vous ouvrira.\\" L’histoire de Georges Müller reste un puissant témoignage de la foi chrétienne, soulignant l'importance de la prière et la confiance en les promesses de Dieu, avec un héritage qui continue d’inspirer des millions de personnes à travers le monde."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Несмотря на прошедшие века, лед не тает и сохраняет свой холод, как будто в нем запечатлен вечный мороз. Амулет известен своей способностью дарить его владельцу необычную стойкость и выносливость в экстремально холодных условиях, а также способность осознанно влиять на погоду в ограниченной зоне вокруг носителя, создавая легкие морозы и метели. История артефакта связана с древними шаманами Севера, которые молились духам зимы и льда за защиту и благосклонность. Говорят, что амулет является даром этих духов одному из великих шаманов, который сумел пройти нелегкое испытание, доказав свою верность и силу духа. Место нахождения: **Трондхейм, Норвегия** В 17 веке амулет был утерян во время одного из многочисленных путешествий и экспедиций к северу. Последние записи указывают на то, что артефакт был спрятан где-то в катакомбах или тайных подземельях Трондхейма, древнего города, заложенного еще в эпоху викингов. Считается, что амулет был спрятан в одной из малоизученных частей старинного монастыря или в закрытых за забытыми стенами туннелях, ведущих к старейшему храму города. Легенды гласят, что только истинный знаток северной мифологии и традиций сможет разгадать местоположение Сердца Севера, пройдя через серию загадок и испытаний, охраняемых духами предков, ожидающих в тени."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Цепь была создана в эпоху неизвестной древней цивилизации и обладает способностью улавливать и хранить звуки и голоса, произнесенные рядом с ней. Владелец может \\"загружать\\" в амулет определенные слова или звуки, которые амулет будет \\"выпускать\\" по команде владельца. Он может хранить до трех разных звуков одновременно. Эти звуки могут быть всем чем угодно, от слов и голосов до шумов природы или шагов. Этот артефакт может использоваться для множества целей: от запугивания врагов звуками зверей до создания иллюзии присутствия человека в комнате, когда его на самом деле нет. Место: **Каменный город Петра, Иордания** Предположим, что Цепь Эхоса была спрятана в одной из самых загадочных и недоступных гробниц древнего города Петра. Город, известный своими монументальными постройками, высеченными прямо в скалах, служил торговым и культурным центром для древних цивилизаций. Среди обширных и запутанных подземных ходов и помещений, которые спрятаны от глаз любопытствующих и исследователей, находится небольшая, почти забытая гробница, стены которой украшены загадочными рунами. Именно там, в самом центре гробницы, на маленьком пьедестале из чистого серебра, и покоится Цепь Эхоса, ожидая, когда ее снова обнаружат. Магический артефакт и место его укрытия могут добавить глубину и интерес к сюжету вашей игры, поскольку игрокам придется не только отыскать загадочный город Петра, но и разгадать древние руны, чтобы открыть доступ к тайной гробнице и забрать Цепь Эхоса."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

На поверхности скрижали встроены тончайшие золотые вензеля, которые светятся под лунным светом. Этот артефакт является инструментом влияния на разум и душу. Его сила позволяет пользователям \\"шептать\\" мысли и желания в умы других людей на расстоянии, делая это настолько незаметно, что сама жертва твердо верит в то, что это её собственные решения и желания. В течение многих лет Шепот Судьбы использовался политическими деятелями, тайными обществами и магами для изменения хода истории или для поднятия на вершину власти. **Возможности**: 1. **Внушение**: Может внушать людям мысли и убеждения, делая это крайне осторожно, чтобы они не осознавали внешнее влияние. 2. **Понимание**: Позволяет понимать глубинные мотивы и желания собеседника, что делает возможным манипулирование их решениями и поступками. 3. **Союзы и раздоры**: Может создавать или разрушать отношения между людьми, незаметно управляя их чувствами и мнениями. 4. **Усиление власти**: Усиливает лидерские качества пользователя, делая его слова и решения кажущимися более убедительными и привлекательными для окружающих. **Место/город, где может быть спрятан**: артефакт Шепот Судьбы может быть спрятан в тайниках древнего города Петра, что находится на территории современной Йордании. Этот город, высеченный в скалах, был построен набатеями в IV веке до н.э. и служил важным торговым перекрестком. За свою историю Петра видела множество завоевателей и торговцев, что делает её идеальным местом для того, чтобы спрятать такой мощный и опасный объект. Глубоко в лабиринтах её скальных гробниц, среди забытых святилищ и загадочных памятников, Шепот Судьбы ждет того, кто сможет раскрыть его секреты и обуздать его мощь."},{"prompt":"Я делаю игру про 17 века.

Созданный в далёком прошлом алхимиками, стремившимися понять загадки Вселенной, компас не просто указывает на север, но и может манипулировать астральными энергиями, привлекая удачу, благосостояние или причиняя несчастья и катастрофы при неправильном использовании. Особенности: 1. Астральное Видение: Владелец может видеть скрытые астральные потоки, которые влияют на судьбу и события мира. 2. Манипуляция Событиями: Путём управления астральными потоками, владелец может мягко склонять события в свою пользу, будь то дипломатия, война или торговля. 3. Защита: Компас создаёт астральный барьер, защищающий владельца от малых физических и магических нападений. 4. Сокровище Изобилия: Через ритуалы астральная энергия может быть направлена на привлечение богатства и урожая. Ограничения: - Из-за своих возможностей артефакт требует огромного количества энергии от владельца, что может привести к изнурению или даже кончине неподготовленного пользователя. - Плохое использование может привести к непредсказуемым и часто катастрофическим результатам, включая природные катастрофы или восстания. Место хранения: Острова Гекаты Описание места: Острова Гекаты – это группа из трёх небольших островов, расположенных в туманных водах Северной Атлантики. Названные в честь древнегреческой богини перекрёстков, Гекаты, острова изобилуют дикой природой и древними руинами. Считается, что здесь астральные потоки сильнее всего, что делает их идеальным местом для хранения артефакта. Острова окружены опасными природными явлениями и защищены загадочной неестественной туманностью, отталкивающей непрошенных гостей. По легендам, Астральный Компас был спрятан в древнем храме, построенном в честь Гекаты, и охраняется забытыми защитниками, веками охраняющими секреты астральных потоков."},{"prompt":"Я делаю игру про 17 века.

Этот артефакт не дарит могущественную силу напрямую, скорее, он влияет на волю и удачу тех, кто его держит. Сердце Мидаса способно вдохновлять людей, заставляя их следовать за владельцем артефакта с несгибаемой верностью. Также оно может слегка повышать вероятность успеха в любом начинании, будь то торговля, военный поход или дипломатия. Однако, его использование требует осторожности: чем чаще артефакт используется, тем труднее владельцу отличать удачу от судьбы, реальность от мечтаний, что может привести к печальным последствиям. Место спрятанности: Этот артефакт хорошо было бы спрятать в Затерянном Городе Цариграде, который является одной из версий древней и легендарной столицы Византийской империи – Константинополя (современный Стамбул), утраченной за века до 17 столетия. Согласно легенде, группа монахов, предвидя падение города, перенесла Сердце Мидаса в тайный подземный храм, расположенный в лабиринтах под руинами древнего города, которые были заброшены и забыты к 17 веку. Это место наделено мистической защитой и загадками, доступ к которому возможен только для достойных, кто может разгадать древние загадки и преодолеть испытания, оставленные монахами. Этот артефакт с его несравненной способностью влиять на судьбы людей и город, переполненный историей и тайнами, великолепно впишутся в сюжет игры, давая игрокам уникальные испытания и вдохновляя их на исследования и приключения."},{"prompt":"Fait moi un message d'écrire a bougera Amina me présenta de la part de son père Kamel pour mon voyage d'étude en Tunis","completion":"Bonjour Amina, J'espère que tu te portes bien.

Here are several strategies to help enhance cognitive functions and overall brain health: # 1. Regular Exercise Exercise is not only good for your body but also for your brain. It increases oxygen flow to the brain, reduces the risk for disorders that lead to memory loss (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and enhances the effects of helpful brain chemicals. # 2. Proper Nutrition Eating a healthy, balanced diet supports brain function and health. Diet rich in antioxidants, good fats, vitamins, and minerals provide energy and aid in protecting against brain diseases. Consuming omega-3 fatty acids (found in fish) is especially beneficial for brain health. # 3. Mental Stimulation Keep your brain engaged and challenged. Activities like puzzles, games, learning a new language, or playing a musical instrument stimulate the brain and can improve memory and cognitive skills. # 4. Quality Sleep Sleep is crucial for brain health. During sleep, your brain consolidates memories and repairs itself. Aim for 7-9 hours per night and maintain a regular sleep schedule. # 5. Stress Management Chronic stress damages the brain. Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to reduce stress levels and improve your brain's functioning. # 6. Social Interaction Social engagement is important for maintaining mental health. Engaging in conversations and spending time with friends and loved ones can improve brain health by reducing stress, depression, and even the risk of dementia. # 7. Continuous Learning The brain loves to learn. Continuous learning and curiosity stimulate the brain and can improve its processing speed and memory retention. Challenge yourself to learn new information or skills. # 8. Limit Sugar Intake High amounts of sugar in your diet can impair brain functions and lead to several health issues, including cognitive decline. Try to minimize sugary foods and beverages. # 9. Stay Hydrated Dehydration can have a negative impact on attention and short-term memory. Make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day. # 10. Mindfulness Practices Mindfulness and meditation are not only stress-relief techniques but have been shown to increase grey matter in the brain, which is involved in muscle control and sensory perception such as seeing and hearing, memory, emotions, speech, decision making, and self-control. Each of these strategies can contribute to a healthier, more powerful brain, but they’re most effective when adopted collectively as part of a lifestyle. Remember, it’s never too late to start making changes that can improve your brain's health."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

BD PROCHOT (Bi-Directional Processor Hot) is an external signal that allows other components to throttle the CPU if they are too hot or for other conditions. Here are steps you can take to try and resolve this issue: 1. **Update ThrottleStop**: Ensure you have the latest version of ThrottleStop. Developers continuously update software to improve compatibility and fix bugs. 2. **BIOS Update**: Check your computer or motherboard manufacturer's website for any BIOS updates. Sometimes an update can add or change features and fix existing issues, potentially unlocking the BD PROCHOT setting in ThrottleStop. 3. **BIOS Settings**: Enter your BIOS setup menu during boot and look for any power management settings that might influence CPU throttling or power-sharing features. Some BIOS interfaces might have an option related to CPU power or thermal management that, once disabled, can make the BD PROCHOT option available. 4. **External Software Conflicts**: Other software that manages CPU temperatures, voltages, or performance, such as manufacturer-specific tuning utilities or Windows power settings, might conflict with ThrottleStop. Try disabling or adjusting these settings. 5. **Check for Hardware Issues**: Although unlikely, hardware issues can potentially cause this option to be greyed out. Ensure your cooling system is working correctly and that there are no overheating issues. 6. **Contact Manufacturer Support**: Some manufacturers may intentionally lock or disable certain features in the BIOS. This is more common in laptops for safety and product differentiation reasons. Reaching out to the manufacturer's support can clarify whether such restrictions are in place for your particular model. 7. **Understand the Implications**: Before attempting to modify BD PROCHOT settings, it's vital to understand the potential consequences. Disabling BD PROCHOT can lead to higher temperatures, which might degrade your CPU's lifespan or cause system instability if cooling is insufficient. If after trying these steps, the BD PROCHOT option remains greyed out, it may not be possible to modify this setting due to restrictions set by the manufacturer or limitations of your hardware. In such cases, focusing on optimizing cooling solutions and managing CPU workload can help mitigate performance throttling issues without needing to modify BD PROCHOT settings."},{"prompt":"Напиши скрипт когда персонаж поворачивается больше чем на 90 градусов по оси X то он пишет привет. на юнити 3д","completion":"Чтобы создать скрипт в Unity, который позволяет персонажу здороваться, когда он поворачивается больше чем на 90 градусов по оси X, вы можете использовать следующий C# код. Этот скрипт предполагает использование системы вращения Euler, которая измеряет углы в градусах по осям X, Y и Z. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class RotationGreeting : MonoBehaviour { private float lastXAngle = 0f; private bool hasGreeted = false; // переменная для избежания повторных приветствий при удержании поворота void Start() { // Изначально запоминаем текущий угол поворота по оси X lastXAngle = transform.eulerAngles.x; } void Update() { float currentXAngle = transform.eulerAngles.x; float angleDifference = Mathf.Abs(currentXAngle - lastXAngle); // Нормализация разницы углов из-за перехода через 0/360 градусов if (angleDifference > 180) { angleDifference = 360 - angleDifference; } // Проверка, совершён ли поворот больше чем на 90 градусов if (angleDifference > 90 && !hasGreeted) { Debug.Log(\\"Привет!\\"); // Замените на ваше приветствие или вызов функции hasGreeted = true; // Пометить, что приветствие выполнено } // Если угол снова меньше 90 градусов, сброс hasGreeted для возможности нового приветствия if (angleDifference < 90) { hasGreeted = false; } lastXAngle = currentXAngle; // Обновляем последний угол для следующей проверки } } \`\`\` Чтобы использовать это, просто добавьте этот скрипт к объекту, вращение которого вы хотите отслеживать.

课题的核心概念及其界定：本课题中，科技教育以一门独立的学科形式存在，以科技教育的“本体”(科学课程，即科技类学科)、“载体和媒体”(各学科渗透)、活动“开发”、环境氛围和教学中心、家庭社区教育和学校教育有机结合的方式发挥着教育功能，它是中学学教育中特殊的基础性、综合性学科。 所谓项目学习，就是学习者围绕某一个具体的学习项目，充分选择和利用最优化的学习资源，在实践体验、内化吸收、探索创新中获得较为完整而具体的知识，形成专门的技能并获得发展的学习，项目学习按学习的需求立项，一般取材于生活，学习者面对的是真实而具体的问题，而不是被“挤干”了各种复杂因素的单纯而抽象的某个学习问题。 “科技教育”项目学习课程开发，是指学校根据高中科技教育的需要和理论，结合学生的需求和年龄特征，充分利用校园环境和周边环境中所蕴含的科技资源，通过自行研讨，或通过与外部力量的合作，确定一项科技项目学习主题，让学生去设计学习活动的方式，并在校内实施以及建立内部评价机制的科技活动。 例子2：课题题目“高中化学分层递进教学研究” 课题的核心概念及其界定：分层教学法，就是教师充分考虑到学生中存在的差异程度，综合考虑每个学生的智力、非智力等因素，运用模糊学的方法，把全班学生分为短期性的(即处于发展变化状态而短期内又相对稳定的)A、B、C三个层次，并依据群体学生的差异，区别对待地制定分层教学目标、设计分层教案、采取分层施教、进行分层评价，并有针对性地加强对不同层次学生的学习指导，从而大面积提高教学质量的方法。 递进是针对学生的个体差异，是在学生分层的基础上，通过有针对性地进行分层备课，分层授课，分层训练，分层辅导、分层评价，最大限度地调动各层次学生的学习积极性，使学生在原有基础上得到相应的尊重和发展。 高中化学分层递进教学研究是指在初中化学教学中，在班级授课制条件下，适应学生差异，教师根据学生现有的知识、能力水平和潜力倾向，把学生科学地分成几组各自水平相近的群体并区别对待，这些群体在教师恰当的分层策略和相互作用中得到最好的发展和提高。其主要目的在于提高学生素质的课堂教学。这种实践的依据是，学生有差异，教师要为适应学生的差异而教，要根据“学生之间的差异是可开发利用的教学资源”这一理论来做出有效的探索。","completion":"课题题目：“基于多模态的智慧课堂学习评价方法研究”

课题的核心概念及其界定：本课题中，科技教育以一门独立的学科形式存在，以科技教育的“本体”(科学课程，即科技类学科)、“载体和媒体”(各学科渗透)、活动“开发”、环境氛围和教学中心、家庭社区教育和学校教育有机结合的方式发挥着教育功能，它是中学学教育中特殊的基础性、综合性学科。 所谓项目学习，就是学习者围绕某一个具体的学习项目，充分选择和利用最优化的学习资源，在实践体验、内化吸收、探索创新中获得较为完整而具体的知识，形成专门的技能并获得发展的学习，项目学习按学习的需求立项，一般取材于生活，学习者面对的是真实而具体的问题，而不是被“挤干”了各种复杂因素的单纯而抽象的某个学习问题。 “科技教育”项目学习课程开发，是指学校根据高中科技教育的需要和理论，结合学生的需求和年龄特征，充分利用校园环境和周边环境中所蕴含的科技资源，通过自行研讨，或通过与外部力量的合作，确定一项科技项目学习主题，让学生去设计学习活动的方式，并在校内实施以及建立内部评价机制的科技活动。 例子2：课题题目“高中化学分层递进教学研究” 课题的核心概念及其界定：分层教学法，就是教师充分考虑到学生中存在的差异程度，综合考虑每个学生的智力、非智力等因素，运用模糊学的方法，把全班学生分为短期性的(即处于发展变化状态而短期内又相对稳定的)A、B、C三个层次，并依据群体学生的差异，区别对待地制定分层教学目标、设计分层教案、采取分层施教、进行分层评价，并有针对性地加强对不同层次学生的学习指导，从而大面积提高教学质量的方法。 递进是针对学生的个体差异，是在学生分层的基础上，通过有针对性地进行分层备课，分层授课，分层训练，分层辅导、分层评价，最大限度地调动各层次学生的学习积极性，使学生在原有基础上得到相应的尊重和发展。 高中化学分层递进教学研究是指在初中化学教学中，在班级授课制条件下，适应学生差异，教师根据学生现有的知识、能力水平和潜力倾向，把学生科学地分成几组各自水平相近的群体并区别对待，这些群体在教师恰当的分层策略和相互作用中得到最好的发展和提高。其主要目的在于提高学生素质的课堂教学。这种实践的依据是，学生有差异，教师要为适应学生的差异而教，要根据“学生之间的差异是可开发利用的教学资源”这一理论来做出有效的探索。","completion":"课题题目：“基于多模态的智慧课堂学习评价方法研究”

Контроллер домена — это сервер, который отвечает за хранение данных каталога для домена, обработку входа в систему, аутентификацию пользователей и пр. В системах на базе Windows Active Directory имеется понятие \\"уровня функциональности\\" как для доменов, так и для леса (группы взаимосвязанных доменов). Этот уровень определяет, какие функции Active Directory доступны в домене или лесу. По умолчанию, при создании нового домена или леса, используется уровень функциональности, соответствующий самой старой версии Windows Server, которую вы хотите поддерживать в своей сети. Повышение уровня функциональности домена позволяет воспользоваться новыми и улучшенными функциями Active Directory, которые не поддерживаются на более низких уровнях. Например, некоторые улучшения могут включать в себя более эффективное реплицирование между сайтами, улучшенные политики безопасности, новые атрибуты объектов в каталоге и т. д. Вот несколько причин, по которым повышение уровня контроллера домена может быть важно: 1. **Включение новых функций**: Как упоминалось, на более высоких уровнях функциональности доступны новые функции Active Directory. 2. **Улучшение производительности и надежности**: Иногда новые уровни функциональности включают улучшения в производительности и надежности работы Active Directory. 3. **Повышение безопасности**: Новые уровни могут предоставлять расширенные возможности для управления безопасностью, такие как более сложные политики паролей или защиту от определенных видов атак. 4. **Обеспечение совместимости**: В некоторых случаях повышение уровня может быть необходимым для интеграции с другими продуктами или сервисами, которые требуют определенного уровня функциональности Active Directory для работы. Однако стоит отметить, что повышение уровня функциональности домена — это шаг, который не может быть отменен без отката всей среды AD к предыдущему состоянию (что может быть очень затруднительно или невозможно). Поэтому перед его выполнением важно тщательно всё спланировать, убедиться в совместимости всех серверов и сервисов в домене и при необходимости провести тестирование в изолированной среде."},{"prompt":"Избегание флуда в деловой переписке как называется термин в среде it","completion":"В деловой переписке и в контексте информационных технологий (IT) стремление избегать излишнего количества ненужных сообщений, таких как флуд, часто обозначается термином \\"email etiquette\\" (этикет электронной почты) или \\"communication management\\" (управление коммуникациями). Хотя не существует строго одного конкретного термина, точно описывающего этот процесс, можно встретить различные названия, отражающие концепцию контроля за эффективностью и качеством обмена сообщениями. \\"Email overload management\\" (управление перегрузкой электронной почты) также может быть использовано для описания стратегий и подходов к снижению избыточного количества электронных писем и к обеспечению того, чтобы обмен сообщениями был продуктивным и не мешал выполнению рабочих задач. Концепции, связанные с этой задачей, включают в себя: - **Ограничение использования \\"Reply All\\" (Ответить всем)**: это помогает уменьшить количество ненужных или несущественных сообщений, получаемых большим количеством людей. - **Консолидация информации**: отправка одного хорошо организованного сообщения вместо множества коротких сообщений по одной и той же теме. - **Четкая структурированность сообщений**: включение всех необходимых деталей в первоначальное сообщение для избежания необходимости в последующих уточняющих вопросах. - **Использование альтернативных каналов связи**: например, обсуждение сложных вопросов во время встреч или звонков, вместо длинных цепочек электронных писем.

Для проверки ЭЦП используется асимметричное криптографическое шифрование, которое включает использование двух ключей: закрытого (или приватного) и открытого (или публичного). Процесс проверки ЭЦП обычно включает в себя следующие шаги: 1. **Получение**: Вы получаете от отправителя файл, его ЭЦП и, возможно, открытый ключ отправителя (если у вас его ещё нет и если сертификат открытого ключа не встроен в саму подпись). 2. **Извлечение хэша из подписи**: - С помощью открытого ключа отправителя (или ключа, содержащегося в сертификате цифровой подписи) вы расшифровываете ЭЦП, прилагаемую к документу. Результатом расшифровки является хэш-значение, которое было получено отправителем на этапе создания ЭЦП. 3. **Подсчет хэша полученного файла**: - Вычисляется хэш-значение для полученного файла с использованием того же алгоритма хеширования, который использовал отправитель. 4. **Сравнение хэш-значений**: - Сравниваются два хэш-значения: одно извлеченное из ЭЦП и другое вычисленное из файла, который вы получили. Если они совпадают, это значит, что файл не был изменен после подписания, и подписант действительно тот, чей открытый ключ вы использовали, т.е. проверка ЭЦП успешно пройдена. 5. **Проверка доверия к ключу**: - Дополнительно может потребоваться удостовериться, что используемый открытый ключ действительно принадлежит отправителю. Это можно сделать через систему доверенных центров сертификации, которая подтверждает подлинность открытых ключей и выдаёт соответствующие сертификаты. Обеспечение целостности и подтверждение авторства — основные цели использования ЭЦП. Важно учитывать, что существуют различные стандарты и реализации ЭЦП, а также что безопасность всей системы во многом зависит от надежности хранения закрытых ключей и процедур выдачи и проверки сертификатов."},{"prompt":"Расскажи подробнее как происходит проверка открытого ключа у удостоверяющего центра","completion":"Проверка открытого ключа у Удостоверяющего Центра (УЦ) — это процесс установления доверия к цифровой подписи и, соответственно, к открытому ключу, использованному для её создания. Для обеспечения доверия к открытым ключам используются цифровые сертификаты. Цифровой сертификат — это электронный документ, который подтверждает принадлежность открытого ключа определённому лицу или организации и содержит информацию о владельце ключа, сам открытый ключ, срок действия сертификата и подпись УЦ, который выдал сертификат. Процесс проверки открытого ключа у УЦ включает следующие шаги: # 1. Получение сертификата Когда вам присылают файл с ЭЦП, вы также должны получить сертификат открытого ключа, использованного для создания подписи. Этот сертификат может быть встроен в подписанный файл или передан отдельно. # 2. Проверка подлинности сертификата Подлинность сертификата проверяется путём проверки цифровой подписи, которой УЦ “подписал” сертификат. Для этого необходимо иметь открытый ключ УЦ, который, в свою очередь, может быть получен через сертификат УЦ. Существуют корневые УЦ, сертификаты которых уже предустановлены в операционных системах и браузерах, что позволяет цепочке доверия работать. # 3. Цепочка доверия Если сертификат открытого ключа был подписан другим УЦ, не являющимся корневым, то для проверки подлинности могут потребоваться дополнительные сертификаты. Создаётся цепочка сертификатов, которая ведёт от данного сертификата к сертификату корневого УЦ. При этом проверяется подлинность каждого сертификата в цепочке. # 4. Проверка данных сертификата Важными моментами при проверке сертификата являются срок его действия и соответствие данных в сертификате (таких как имя владельца) ожидаемым. Также проверяются различные параметры сертификата, включая использование определённых ключей для определённых целей (например, подписи или шифрования). # 5. Проверка статуса отзыва сертификата Даже если сертификат выглядит валидным, его могли отозвать до истечения срока действия. Для проверки текущего статуса сертификата используются списки отозванных сертификатов (CRL) или протокол онлайн-проверки статуса сертификата (OCSP). Это позволяет удостовериться, что сертификат не был отозван и по-прежнему действителен. # Заключение В итоге, если все проверки пройдены успешно, вы можете быть уверены в том, что открытый ключ действительно принадлежит указанному в сертификате лицу или организации и что его можно безопасно использовать для проверки ЭЦП или для шифрования данных.

В CSR указывается открытый ключ и некоторая идентифицирующая информация о владельце ключа. УЦ проводит процедуры проверки подлинности лица или организации, делающих запрос. # 2. Выпуск сертификата После успешной проверки подлинности УЦ выпускает сертификат, который содержит открытый ключ, информацию о владельце ключа, срок действия сертификата и другие данные. Сертификат также содержит цифровую подпись УЦ, что позволяет другим сторонам верифицировать его подлинности. # 3. Подписание файла Имея сертификат, подписывающее лицо может подписывать файлы с помощью своего закрытого ключа. Процесс подписи включает в себя создание хэш-суммы (криптографический отпечаток) содержимого файла и её шифрование закрытым ключом. Полученная ЭЦП вместе с самим файлом и сертификатом открытого ключа передается получателям. # 4. Валидация и доверие Когда получатель получает подписанный файл и сертификат открытого ключа, он использует сертификат для верификации ЭЦП (что подтверждает, что файл не был изменен после подписания) и для установления доверия к подписи. Для проверки подлинности и доверия к сертификату, получатель может воспользоваться услугами УЦ (или другого доверенного сертификационного центра), который выпустил сертификат. Весь процесс ЭЦП и взаимодействие с УЦ спроектированы для обеспечения целостности данных, аутентификации источника, и невозможности отказа от авторства (неподтверждение отправки/создания данных). Это ключевые принципы, лежащие в основе безопасных электронных коммуникаций и транзакций."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These metrics can fluctuate. 2. **Niche Functionality**: Integration with payment systems like Alipay and WeChat Pay is quite specific, and often projects might support these through external libraries or plugins rather than direct integration. 3. **Rapid Changes**: The landscape of open-source projects can change rapidly with new contributions, updates, and sometimes projects becoming inactive. However, I can guide you on how to search for Django projects or packages that might fit these criteria and mention a few projects that, while not necessarily the top or exclusive to your requirements, are indicative of the type of project you're interested in. For up-to-date, specific projects, a fresh search on GitHub or PyPI (Python Package Index) and reviewing the project documentation will be most effective. # Searching for Projects When looking for Django or DRF projects supporting specific payment systems: - **GitHub Search**: Use GitHub's search feature with keywords like \`Django Alipay\`, \`Django WeChat Pay\`, \`django-rest-framework alipay\`, etc. - **PyPI Search**: Search the Python Package Index using similar keywords to find reusable Django/DRF apps or libraries. - **Community Forums**: Django and DRF have active communities. Forums like Reddit's r/django or the Django Users Google Group can be useful for recommendations. # Example Projects and Packages As of my last update, specific projects or packages that integrate payment systems with Django/DRF apps might not rank as the \\"top\\" by popularity but could serve as references or starting points: 1. **dj-paypal**: While focused on PayPal, this project is a good example of integrating a payment system with Django, implying the methods and structure might be adapted or inspire integration with Alipay or WeChat Pay. 2. **django-payments**: This project aims to provide a universal payment handling for Django, and while it might not directly support Alipay or WeChat Pay out of the box, it has an extensible design that could potentially be adapted. 3. **Payment Libraries**: For specific payment integration, libraries like \`python-alipay-sdk\` or \`wechatpy\` could be used within a Django or DRF project, even if they are not exclusively Django packages. # Developing Custom Integration Given the specialized nature of integrating specific payment gateways like Alipay and WeChat Pay within Django/DRF projects, developers often build custom solutions using the official SDKs provided by Alipay and WeChat Pay. They achieve this by: - Utilizing the REST framework capabilities to create API endpoints. - Implementing the payment service's SDK according to the project's requirements. - Ensuring secure handling of transactions according to the payment service's guidelines. # Conclusion For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on GitHub or discussions in Django communities could yield more specific projects or new initiatives supporting Alipay and WeChat Pay. Keep an eye out for Django extensions or third-party applications that are designed to interface with various payment providers, as these types of projects are likely to offer the functionality you're seeking or, at least, provide a foundation that you can extend."},{"prompt":"please list top 5 database models for online shop from github","completion":"Finding the \\"top\\" database models for online shops on GitHub or any other platform can be subjective, as it depends on the criteria used for evaluation—such as star ratings, number of forks, community engagement, or specific features like support for internationalization, scalability, or ease of customization. As of my last update in April 2023, there aren’t universally acknowledged \\"top 5\\" database models solely focused on GitHub since many projects encapsulate broader functionalities, including their database models as part of a larger e-commerce platform solution.

The neck width, often referred to as the \\"nut width,\\" varies from one guitar model to another, across both electric and acoustic types. Here's a general overview: # Acoustic Guitars - **Wider Necks:** Acoustic guitars, especially classical guitars, often have wider necks. Classical guitars typically have nut widths around 2 inches (about 50mm). This width provides more space between strings, which is beneficial for playing fingerstyle or classical compositions. Steel-string acoustics also tend to have wider necks than electric guitars, usually ranging from about 1.68 inches (42.67mm) to 1.75 inches (44.45mm) or more. The wider neck can offer more comfort for chordal playing and fingerpicking. # Electric Guitars - **Narrower Necks:** Electric guitars often feature narrower necks compared to acoustic guitars. The typical nut width for many electric guitars is around 1.65 inches (42mm). This slightly narrower profile can make it easier for some players to grasp and play the guitar, especially for fast lead playing or for those with smaller hands. These dimensions are not uniform, though, and can vary depending on the make and model of the guitar. # Variations and Purpose - **Playability and Style:** The choice between wider and narrower necks often comes down to playability and the style of music one intends to play. Wider necks can facilitate fingerstyle playing and complex chord voicings, making them preferred for classical, jazz, and some folk music. Narrower necks might favor electric guitar players who employ techniques such as bending and fast soloing, common in rock, metal, and blues. - **Model Variations:** Even within the general categories of electric and acoustic guitars, there's a range of neck widths available. Some electric guitar models are designed with wider necks to accommodate specific play styles, and similarly, some acoustics have narrower necks to appeal to transitioning electric guitarists or those seeking a different feel. Ultimately, the choice of neck width is subjective and should be guided by personal preference, playability, and the specific requirements of your music. It's always a good idea to try out different guitars to see which neck width feels best for your playing style."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

We introduce the focal loss starting from the cross entropy (CE) loss for binary classification1: CE(p,y)={−log§−log(1−p)if y=1otherwise.(1) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.In the above y∈{±1} specifies the ground-truth class and p∈[0,1] is the model’s estimated probability for the class with label y=1. For notational convenience, we define pt: pt={p1−pif y=1otherwise,(2) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.and rewrite CE(p,y)=CE(pt)=−log(pt). The CE loss can be seen as the blue (top) curve in Fig. 1. One notable property of this loss, which can be easily seen in its plot, is that even examples that are easily classified (pt≫.5) incur a loss with non-trivial magnitude. When summed over a large number of easy examples, these small loss values can overwhelm the rare class. 3.1 Balanced Cross Entropy A common method for addressing class imbalance is to introduce a weighting factor α∈[0,1] for class 1 and 1−α for class −1. In practice α may be set by inverse class frequency or treated as a hyperparameter to set by cross validation. For notational convenience, we define αt analogously to how we defined pt. We write the α-balanced CE loss as: CE(pt)=−αtlog(pt).(3) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.This loss is a simple extension to CE that we consider as an experimental baseline for our proposed focal loss. 3.2 Focal Loss Definition As our experiments will show, the large class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors overwhelms the cross entropy loss. Easily classified negatives comprise the majority of the loss and dominate the gradient. While α balances the importance of positive/negative examples, it does not differentiate between easy/hard examples. Instead, we propose to reshape the loss function to down-weight easy examples and thus focus training on hard negatives. More formally, we propose to add a modulating factor (1−pt)γ to the cross entropy loss, with tunable focusing parameter γ≥0. We define the focal loss as: FL(pt)=−(1−pt)γlog(pt).(4) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.The focal loss is visualized for several values of γ∈[0,5] in Fig. 1. We note two properties of the focal loss. (1) When an example is misclassified and pt is small, the modulating factor is near 1 and the loss is unaffected. As pt→1, the factor goes to 0 and the loss for well-classified examples is down-weighted. (2) The focusing parameter γ smoothly adjusts the rate at which easy examples are down-weighted. When γ=0, FL is equivalent to CE, and as γ is increased the effect of the modulating factor is likewise increased (we found γ=2 to work best in our experiments). Intuitively, the modulating factor reduces the loss contribution from easy examples and extends the range in which an example receives low loss. For instance, with γ=2, an example classified with pt=0.9 would have 100× lower loss compared with CE and with pt≈0.968 it would have 1000× lower loss. This in turn increases the importance of correcting misclassified examples (whose loss is scaled down by at most 4× for pt≤.5 and γ=2). In practice we use an α-balanced variant of the focal loss: FL(pt)=−αt(1−pt)γlog(pt).(5) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.We adopt this form in our experiments as it yields slightly improved accuracy over the non-α-balanced form. Finally, we note that the implementation of the loss layer combines the sigmoid operation for computing p with the loss computation, resulting in greater numerical stability. While in our main experimental results we use the focal loss definition above, its precise form is not crucial. In Section 3.5 we consider other instantiations of the focal loss and demonstrate that these can be equally effective. 3.3 Class Imbalance and Model Initialization Binary classification models are by default initialized to have equal probability of outputting either y=−1 or 1. Under such an initialization, in the presence of class imbalance, the loss due to the frequent class can dominate total loss and cause instability in early training. To counter this, we introduce the concept of a ‘prior’ for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class (foreground) at the start of training. We denote the prior by π and set it so that the model’s estimated p for examples of the rare class is low, e.g., 0.01. We note that this is a change in model initialization (see Section 4.1) and not of the loss function. We found this to improve training stability for both the cross entropy and focal loss in the case of heavy class imbalance.” From the above paper, summarize and explain the focal loss with figures and equation shown above. Try use your own words, do not directly copy the above sentences.","completion":"Focal Loss is a solution tailored for situations where there's significant imbalance between foreground and background classes in object detection tasks—imagine having to detect a rare object in a vast background, which is common in tasks like detecting small objects in large scenes. The journey starts with the Cross Entropy (CE) loss, commonly used for binary classification. The CE loss calculates the loss depending on whether the true class is positive or negative, and adjusting according to the model's estimated probability of the class being positive. This approach, however, doesn't account for the degree of difficulty in classifying examples—mistakes on hard-to-classify examples are treated the same as mistakes on easy ones. To mitigate class imbalance, the concept of Balanced Cross Entropy comes into play by introducing a weighting factor (α). This factor helps adjust the loss based on class, but still doesn't differentiate between easy and hard examples. Here's where Focal Loss revolutionizes the approach. It introduces a modulating factor which scales the loss based on how difficult an example is to classify. The closer the model's predicted probability (p) is to 1 for the correct class, the more the loss is reduced. This is controlled by a focusing parameter, γ, which helps adjust how quickly the effect of this modulating factor drops off. The intuition is: \\"focus more on hard examples and less on the easy ones.\\" Visually imagine a graph where the typical CE loss might show a steady decrease in loss as the probability of correct classification increases. With Focal Loss, as γ increases, this curve steepens in the middle—indicating a rapid decrease in loss for examples that are nearly correctly classified, thereby lowering the contribution of easy examples to the overall loss. In practice, an α-balanced version of the Focal Loss is used, which combines the initial class weighting concept with the Focal Loss, further tuning the model's attention towards hard, misclassified examples. The introduction of a 'prior' probability for rare class detection at the start of training is another innovation—this helps in stabilizing training in heavily imbalanced scenarios by tweaking the initial model expectation towards expecting rare classes less often. In essence, Focal Loss smartly redistributes the importance of examples based on their classification difficulty, ensuring that models become better attuned to the nuances of detecting rare objects amidst vast backgrounds, without being overwhelmed by the abundance of easy negatives."},{"prompt":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 2023年年度报告点评：经营业绩短期承压，加大研发布局未来 2024-04-09 16:11:44 国元证券给予广联达买入评级 2024-04-09 16:21:00 没加仓加仓现在可以平仓跑路了 2024-04-09 11:06:34 师姐18.3已建仓广联达 2023-10-30 17:23:40 外资跑多些，股价继续砸便宜点 2024-04-09 16:21:08 国元证券维持广联达买入评级 预计2024年净利润同比增长306.46% 2024-04-09 16:14:27 昨天刚割了，今天就涨[怒][怒][怒][怒] 2024-04-09 11:40:35 拿好，别倒在起跑线！！！！ 2024-04-09 11:11:05 建仓完毕 2024-04-08 21:34:07 11元钱买了一万股，11.15卖了4000股，不贪就能赚 2024-04-09 15:02:14 营收60多亿，80毛利润，净利润怎么只有1亿，收入会不会造假 2024-04-09 14:28:21 内外资对倒，高度控盘了（张磊还没卖完吗？） 2024-04-09 14:44:54 明天有可能还会涨 2024-04-09 14:41:43 上涨乏力。。。 2024-04-09 14:31:13 能抄底了吗？之前抄了3次都不是低，这次再来100股学习一下吧 2024-04-09 12:29:54 我追涨 2024-04-09 13:19:15 广联达今天的第一压力位11.1元，第二压力位11.29元，第三压力位11.41元 2024-04-09 10:53:17 卖卖卖，不卖被埋 2024-04-09 11:20:52 我要飞得更高，飞得更高，飞得更高 2024-04-09 13:16:49 没想到今天刚建仓就亏损了，目前两成仓，成本11.07，记录一下[加油] 2024-04-08 15:05:35 金叉反转中 2024-04-09 10:25:30 跌幅深的都要集中反弹回去了。批量涨 2024-04-09 11:10:19 金叉反转中 2024-04-09 10:24:57 难得广联达今天没跌还有点不适应[旺柴] 2024-04-09 10:36:07 昨天11块买了，抓一个波段做T 2024-04-09 11:00:34 这股坏就坏在外资上。外资持股比例过大。加上又和房地产夕阳产业强相关，外资一直在卖 2024-04-09 10:11:00 近期大跌，除了业绩原因外，应该和大批员工股解禁有关 2023-10-31 11:42:15 恭喜广联达成功站上11块高峰[鼓掌][鼓掌][鼓掌]未来可期 2024-04-09 10:49:57 等个位数吧。一季度裁员赔偿了很多钱 2024-04-09 09:27:02 盯了许久，今天建仓，10.96，没能10元以下，那也要11元以下 2024-04-09 09:40:35 昨天低吸的过11跑吧 2024-04-09 09:39:56 散户想赚钱太难不知道你们发现了没有，指数还在三千点以上，很多股，己经跌回了270 2024-04-09 08:49:42 广联达(002410.SZ)：已累计回购0.9434%股份 2024-04-02 22:50:54 垃圾中垃圾股 2024-04-09 09:53:06 广联达最新董秘问答 2024-04-09 09:50:26 谁还敢买 2024-04-09 09:20:38 这票放着一年不看它会怎样 2024-04-09 08:06:42 下一个起爆的风口是风电设备，广联达将阴跌不止，看到的回头是岸，及早暴富 2024-04-09 09:44:42 以为今天有奇迹出现，看样子又玩完。 2024-04-09 09:39:29 如果你不想亏钱，破了12.33赶紧一键清仓，船小好调头，高领去年就清仓了。得少亏 2024-03-26 10:44:33 这个样子，跌停不了。 2024-04-09 09:23:31 散户想赚钱太难不知道你们发现了没有，指数还在三千点以上，很多股，己经跌回了270 2024-04-09 08:51:02 建仓完毕，静待花开 2024-04-03 15:14:52 软件类票绝大部分不能碰。广联达更是一部血泪史呀！！！ 2024-04-09 06:54:55 牛逼 2024-04-09 09:18:21 广联达：融资净偿还241.57万元，融资余额4.71亿元（04-08） 2024-04-09 08:55:00 这票票这几天要跌到个位数，以后两位数是大顶，不信半个月后就验证 2024-04-09 08:28:39 深股通已经连续九天减持广联达了[旺柴] 2024-04-09 06:05:22 越补越亏，十几万灰飞烟灭。成神经病了！上班恍惚，吃饭没劲。生活中舍不得花一分钱， 2024-04-09 07:51:23 17的成本，不知道啥时候能回本，真绝了！ 2024-04-08 15:32:31 广联达04月08日被深股通减持245.75万股 2024-04-09 04:19:01 这2个股刚刚看到希望又被浇灭了。股价波动就没有一直涨的只有一直跌的。活在Ａ股真是 2024-04-09 04:14:31 不是害怕广联达下跌，主要是跌的不是时候，不知主力看没看到现在大盘还在3047点啊 2024-04-08 15:51:34 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-04-08 21:56:48 感觉有点复刻2016年走势，目前来说一模一样。 2024-04-08 20:37:38 房地产在大涨了！ 2024-04-08 10:27:10 我46的本什么时候可以回本 2024-04-08 17:35:36 回头看21年在66的顶部买过，逃走后再也没入，买了其他也一样被坑，这闹人的行情啊 2024-04-08 19:16:55 我同学说9元，大家等一下等9元见 2024-03-28 09:29:23 妈呀，天呀，毛都跌光了 2024-04-08 17:31:09 这，奔着1块以下，退市去的？ 2024-04-08 17:03:39 哎，说广联达垃圾吧，其实整个股市都垃圾，选择炒股，走错一步 2024-04-08 15:47:02 一个55跌到11的公司，散户大多数均是开着宝马车进去，终是骑着电动车出来。 2024-04-06 12:20:38 又抢购到10万股，收盘必赚钱[买入][看多][主力][火箭][大笑] 2024-04-08 14:44:28 明天上午惯性下跌2个点到10.7附近，仓位不重的个人感觉可以补点仓位 2024-04-08 15:32:01 这个股能买不！我看大部分人应该亏的很厉害了吧 2024-04-08 13:47:15 病的不轻呀！股价走成这个熊样。 2024-04-08 14:34:46 谢谢主力给我转筹码，好股票，大家一起抢购赚钱[买入][看多][主力][火箭][大 2024-04-08 13:36:32 割了 2024-04-08 14:34:37 广联达会是第一批再创新低的吗？ 2024-04-08 14:13:42 广联达，很快就到了2月6号的点位，现在已经确定还有更低，而且没有尽头，因为双底不 2024-04-08 13:55:52 百万实盘第45天 2023-12-03 22:22:02 10.97买点来低吸高抛，不能买到破10去做长线。 2024-04-08 13:49:10 做空真好！我们的杀猪盘 2024-04-08 13:55:43 有点了 2024-04-08 13:54:36 毫无底线的发套 2024-04-08 13:53:09 都在做空，只有散户只能做多这一个选项 2024-04-08 13:50:06 【002410】把成本控制再安全价格11.15下，11.5多高价捡点好高抛。 2024-04-02 11:16:06 这个股没有底，正在卖公司 2024-04-08 13:48:19 没有底线的下跌，跌破支撑线，再见 2024-04-08 13:47:37","completion":"1. 综合大家的评论，广联达股票的经营业绩短期承压，但加大研发布局未来； 2. 国元证券给予广联达买入评级，并预计2024年净利润同比增长306.46%； 3. 有人建议平仓跑路，有人认为可能还会涨； 4. 有投资者抄底，也有投资者追涨； 5. 有人表达对股票未来发展的乐观态度，认为未来可期； 6. 一些投资者认为外资持股比例过大，造成股价下跌； 7. 有人对广联达的股价走势感到失望，认为股价走向不符合预期； 8. 建仓的投资者表示静待花开，继续持有股票； 9. 有人认为广联达股票可能会跌到个位数，建议及早清仓。 有用信息：广联达股票目前面临着经营业绩短期承压的问题，但也存在着未来发展加大研发布局的潜力，国元证券给予其买入评级，并预计2024年净利润同比增长306.46%。外资持股比例过大可能导致股价继续下跌，建议投资者谨慎对待股票投资。"},{"prompt":"Write 10 wow tweets about today’s red sky in a morning at sunrise","completion":"1. \\"Woke up to a sky ablaze!

For instance, with γ=2, an example classified with pt=0.9 would have 100× lower loss compared with CE and with pt≈0.968 it would have 1000× lower loss. This in turn increases the importance of correcting misclassified examples (whose loss is scaled down by at most 4× for pt≤.5 and γ=2). In practice we use an α-balanced variant of the focal loss: FL(pt)=−αt(1−pt)γlog(pt).(5) View SourceRight-click on figure for MathML and additional features.We adopt this form in our experiments as it yields slightly improved accuracy over the non-α-balanced form. Finally, we note that the implementation of the loss layer combines the sigmoid operation for computing p with the loss computation, resulting in greater numerical stability. While in our main experimental results we use the focal loss definition above, its precise form is not crucial. In Section 3.5 we consider other instantiations of the focal loss and demonstrate that these can be equally effective. 3.3 Class Imbalance and Model Initialization Binary classification models are by default initialized to have equal probability of outputting either y=−1 or 1. Under such an initialization, in the presence of class imbalance, the loss due to the frequent class can dominate total loss and cause instability in early training. To counter this, we introduce the concept of a ‘prior’ for the value of p estimated by the model for the rare class (foreground) at the start of training. We denote the prior by π and set it so that the model’s estimated p for examples of the rare class is low, e.g., 0.01. We note that this is a change in model initialization (see Section 4.1) and not of the loss function. We found this to improve training stability for both the cross entropy and focal loss in the case of heavy class imbalance.” From the above paper, summarize and explain the focal loss with figures and equation shown above. Try use your own words, do not directly copy the above sentences.","completion":"Focal loss is a modified version of the cross entropy (CE) loss designed to tackle the challenge posed by the vast imbalance between foreground and background classes often encountered in one-stage object detection tasks. This imbalance could be as severe as 1:1000, where the background (negative examples) vastly outnumbers the foreground (positive examples). Let's break down the concept of focal loss into more accessible terms: 1. **Cross Entropy Loss**: This is our starting point. Cross entropy loss calculates the difference between the predicted probability of an instance belonging to a certain class and the actual class label. It uses a logarithmic function to penalize incorrect predictions. However, even easily classified examples (those with a high probability of being correctly classified) generate a non-negligible loss. When aggregated, these small loss contributions from a large number of easy examples can overshadow the rarer class, leading to poor model performance on the class of interest. 2. **Balanced Cross Entropy**: To manage class imbalance, a weighting factor, α, is introduced, giving different weights to the losses from positive and negative examples. This method is straightforward but serves more as a baseline for comparison with focal loss. 3. **Focal Loss Introduction**: Focal loss builds upon the idea of balanced cross entropy but adds a critical twist. It incorporates a modulating factor, (1-pt)^γ, which scales down the loss for well-classified examples (easy examples). Here, pt is the model's estimated probability for the ground truth class after adjusting for the actual class label, and γ is a tunable parameter that controls the rate at which the loss for easy examples is scaled down. This adjustment ensures that the model focuses more on hard-to-classify examples during training. 4. **Key Properties**: - For misclassified or difficult examples where pt is small, the modulating factor is near 1, meaning the loss is barely altered. - As an example becomes easier to classify (pt approaches 1), the modulating factor approaches 0, effectively reducing the loss contribution from such examples. - The rate at which this loss reduction happens is controlled by γ; the higher the γ, the faster the reduction. A γ of 2 is commonly found to be effective. 5. **Implementation Details**: An α-balanced version of focal loss is often used, which combines the idea of balanced cross entropy with the modulating factor for improved accuracy. The implementation is also coupled with the sigmoid operation to ensure numerical stability. 6. **Model Initialization**: Given the severe class imbalance, initializing the model to treat both classes (foreground and background) equally could lead to the dominant class (usually the background) overwhelming the total loss early in training. Introducing a 'prior' for the probability estimation of the rare class helps mitigate this instability by making the model more skeptical of an instance being from the rare class at the start. The focal loss, therefore, is an evolved form of the cross entropy loss, specifically designed to enhance the detection of rare classes by demphasizing the loss contributions from easily classified examples and thereby directing the model's learning focus towards harder examples."},{"prompt":"请将“Jede historische kapitalistische Gesellschaftsformation erhält ihre vor-übergehende Stabilität durch eine einander entsprechende Akkumulat- ions- und Regulationsweise. Dadurch ergibt sich eine bestimmte gesellschaftliche Entwicklungsweise. Diese ist jeweils durch eigene Gesetz- und Regelmäßigkeiten gekennzeichnet. Hervorzuheben ist, dass Akkumula-tionsregimes und Regulationsweisen in keinem einfachen Verursachungs-verhältnis stehen. Sie sind nicht voneinander »ableitbar«. Weder bringt ein Akkumulationsregime mit Notwendigkeit die ihm entsprechende Regulationsweise hervor, noch umgekehrt. Ein stabiles Akkumulationsregime kann sich allerdings nur herausbilden, wenn sich zugleich ein entsprechender Regulationszusammenhang durchsetzt. Beides muss als Ergebnis sozialer Auseinandersetzungen und Kämpfe auf verschiedenen gesellschaftlichen Ebenen betrachtet werden, deren Ausgang nicht objektiv vorbestimmt ist, sondern von der Stärke, den Strategien und Erfolgen der beteiligten Akteure abhängt. Dadurch ist ein variables Gefüge unterschiedlicher Akkumulationsregimes und Regulationsweisen möglich. Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen stehen also nicht in einem kausalen oder funktionalen, sondern in einem Verbindungs- oder Artikulationsverhältnis. Sie müssen als Verknüpfung komplexer und relativ selbstständiger Handlungs- und Praxiszusammenhänge betrachtet werden. Insofern hat Lipietz Recht, wenn er die verschiedenen bisher entstandenen kapitalistischen Formationen als »Fundsachen« bezeichnet. Diese Formulierung bezieht sich darauf, dass die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus ein grundsätzlich offener Prozess ohne vordefinierten Ausgang ist. Ob sich aus der Krise einer vorhandenen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise eine neue herausbildet, wie diese aussieht und als wie stabil sie sich erweist, ist das Ergebnis sozialer Handlungen und Kämpfe. Inwieweit die kapitalistische Gesellschaft sich über Krisen und Brüche hinweg immer wieder neu stabilisiert, krisenhaft zusammenbricht oder aber politisch überwunden wird, ist nicht das Ergebnis einer objektiven Gesetzmäßigkeit, sondern muss als eine Folge sozialen Handelns betrachtet werden. Dieses ist allerdings innerhalb kapitalistischer Verhältnisse nicht frei und beliebig wählbar, sondern bleibt strukturellen Bedingungen und sozialen Formbestimmungen unterworfen. Wenn der Akkumulations- und Verwertungsprozess des Kapitals unterbrochen wird, steht der Bestand der Gesellschaft überhaupt, die Arbeitsplätze ebenso wie die materielle Existenz in Frage und bestimmte soziale Formen, wie sie sich beispielsweise in der Gestalt des Staates ausdrücken, sind nicht zu beseitigen, solange die kapitalistische Gesellschaftsstruktur bestehen bleibt. Staat und Zivilgesellschaft Stabilere Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen haben sich bisher in der Regel innerhalb einzelstaatlicher Räume gebildet, weil innerhalb dieses zentralisierten Machtzusammenhangs am ehesten die soziokulturellen Voraussetzungen für das Entstehen gemeinsamer Wert- und Ordnungsvorstellungen sowie darauf gegründeter sozialer Kompromissbildungen gegeben sind. Vor allem existieren nur hier die institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen - Beteiligungsregeln, Entscheidungsverfahren usw. -, durch die diese wirksam werden können (Lipietz 1985). Weil Regulation aus dem Zusammenspiel unterschiedlicher und relativ voneinander unabhängiger Institutionen und Prozesse entsteht, hat sie zwar kein steuerndes Subjekt, besitzt im Staat jedoch ein institutionelles Zentrum, weil die physische Zwangsgewalt Grundlage für den Erhalt der Klassenverhältnisse, ihrer sozialen Formen und institutionellen Aus-drucksweisen ist und weil soziale Kompromisse nur dort verbindlich fest-geschrieben werden können. Falsch wäre indessen die Annahme, der Staat steuere die Gesellschaft. Vielmehr garantiert er den Prozess der Regulation mit Hilfe seiner Zwangsmittel und ist zugleich selbst Gegenstand der Regulation, weil sich sein institutionelles Gefüge entsprechend der Ak-kumulationsbedingungen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse ebenfalls verändert (Jessop 1990a, 367ff.). Diese führen immer auch zu Modifikationen im Netzwerk des politischen Systems, d.h. im Verhältnis der administrativen Apparate zueinander, in den Formen der Repräsentation oder der Art und Weise parteilicher oder verbandsförmiger Interessenvermittlung (Jessop 1982, 238ff.). Die konkrete Gestalt des Staates, das bestimmte Verhältnis von »Staat« und »Gesellschaft«, die Form staatlicher Interventionen und die Institutionalisierung gesellschaftlicher Beziehungen sind also nicht festgeschrieben, sondern verändern sich mit den Bedingungen der Regulation. Damit lässt sich auch das Verhältnis von »Politik« und »Ökonomie«, von »Staat« und »Wirtschaft« genauer bestimmen. Es gibt keinen ökonomischen Bereich unabhängig von Regulation und Staat. Der Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals ist immer schon in die Regulation mit dem Staat als institutionellem Zentrum eingebunden, auch wenn sich dessen Funktion und Bedeutung entsprechend des jeweiligen Akkumulationsregimes und der Regulationsweise historisch verändern. Und zugleich bleibt Regulation abhängig von Verlauf und Entwicklung des Akkumulationsprozesses. Die Vorstellung, die »Politik« steuere die »Wirtschaft« - oder umgekehrt -, ist daher grundsätzlich falsch. »Akkumulation« und »Regulation« bilden eine durch jeweils eigene soziale Praxen und Dynamiken bestimmte und somit widersprüchliche Einheit. Analog zum Begriff des »integralen Staates« bei Gramsci könnte man bei der Regulationstheorie von einem Konzept der »integralen Ökonomie« sprechen. Oder anders ausgedrückt kann sie deutlich machen, was der Begriff »politische Ökonomie« eigentlich heißt (Jessop 1990a; Delor- me 1992). Wichtig ist, dass Regulation nicht nur auf dem Einsatz staatlicher Gewaltmittel beruht, sondern immer eines gewissen gesellschaftlichen Konsenses und einer freiwilligen Folgebereitschaft bedarf, um einigermaßen dauerhaft zu sein. Wenn Max Weber den Staat als Inhaber des Monopols legitimer physischer Gewaltsamkeit bezeichnet, so verweist er - wie später vor allem Gramsci - auf den engen Zusammenhang von Zwang und Konsens in jedem Herrschaftsverhältnis (Gramsci 1986, 199ff.). Die Durchsetzung relativ stabiler Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhänge ist daher an eine politisch-ideologische Hegemonie gebunden. Schon die Form des Staates als von der Gesellschaft, ihren sozialen Antagonismen und Klassen formell getrennte, den individualisierten Staatsbürgerinnen verselbständigt gegenübertretende Instanz ist eine entscheidende Grundlage der politischen Legitimation. Dadurch kann der Staat als ein neutraler Sachwalter des »Gemeinwohls« wahrgenommen werden. Unter bürgerlich-demokratischen Verhältnissen erweist sich dieser Legitimationszusammenhang in der Regel als besonders wirksam. Indem der Prozess der Regulation den Klassenkonflikt in eine mit der Akkumulation des Kapitals verträgliche Form bringt und eben dadurch den materiellen Produktionsprozess stabilisiert, rechtfertigt er sich bei den betroffenen Menschen gewissermaßen fortwährend selbst. Krisen der Regulation tragen daher immer die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Krisen des Staates, des politischen Systems und der Hegemonie in sich.”翻译为中文","completion":"每一个历史上的资本主义社会形态通过一种相互对应的积累方式和调节方式获得其暂时的稳定。由此产生一种特定的社会发展方式。每种方式都具有其自身的法则和规律性。值得强调的是，积累体制和调节方式之间并不存在简单的因果关系。它们无法相互“推导”。积累体制既不必然产生相应的调节方式，反之亦然。然而，只有当相应的调节关系得以确立时，一个稳定的积累体制才能形成。两者都必须被视为社会斗争和冲突在各种社会层面上的结果，其结果并非客观预定，而是取决于参与行动者的力量、策略和成功。因此，不同的积累体制和调节方式的变化结构是可能的。积累体制和调节方式因此不是处于因果或功能关系，而是处于联系或表述关系中。它们必须被视为复杂且相对独立的行动和实践关系的联系。 在这方面，Lipietz称呼迄今为止形成的各种资本主义形态为“发现物”是正确的。这个表述意味着，资本主义的发展是一个根本开放的过程，没有预定义的结果。一种现有的积累和调节方式的危机是否能产生新的形式，这种新形式是什么样的，以及它的稳定性如何，都是社会行动和斗争的结果。资本主义社会能否在危机和断裂中重新稳定自身，陷入危机性崩溃，或被政治上克服，不是某种客观法则的结果，而应被视为社会行动的后果。尽管这种行为受到资本主义条件下结构性条件和社会形式的限制，但它不是自由和任意选择的。当资本的积累和增值过程中断时，社会的存在、就业岗位以及物质存亡都受到威胁，而特定的社会形式，如以国家形式表现的，只要资本主义社会结构存在，就无法消除。 国家和民间社会 更稳定的积累体制和调节方式通常形成于国家单元内部，因为在这种集中权力关系中，产生共同的价值观和秩序观以及基于此的社会妥协的社会文化前提最为可能。尤其是，只有在这里才有实现这些的制度框架——参与规则、决策程序等（Lipietz 1985）。因为调节来源于不同且相对独立的机构和过程的相互作用，它虽然没有控制主体，但在国家中却拥有一个机构中心，因为物理强制力是维持阶级关系、其社会形式和机构表达方式的基础，而社会妥协也只能在这里被有约束力地确定。然而，错误的假设是国家控制社会。相反，国家通过其强制手段保障调节过程，并且本身也是调节的对象，因为其机构框架根据积累条件和社会力量关系也在变化（Jessop 1990a, 367ff）。这始终导致政治系统网络的修改，即行政机构之间的关系、代表形式或政党或协会形式的利益传达方式的变化（Jessop 1982, 238ff）。因此，国家的具体形态，“国家”与“社会”的特定关系、国家干预的形式以及社会关系的制度化并不是固定的，而是随着调节条件的变化而变化。 这也更准确地界定了“政治”与“经济”、 “国家”与“经济”的关系。没有独立于调节和国家之外的经济领域。资本的积累过程已经融入到以国家为机构中心的调节中，尽管其功能和重要性根据不同的积累体制和调节方式在历史上发生变化。同时，调节仍然依赖于积累过程的进程和发展。因此，“政治”控制“经济”-或相反-的观念本质上是错误的。“积累”和“调节”形成了一个由各自的社会实践和动态确定的、因此是矛盾的统一体。 类似于Gramsci的“整体国家”概念，可以在调节理论中谈论一个“整体经济”的概念。或者换句话说，它可以清楚地表达“政治经济学”这个概念实际上意味着什么（Jessop 1990a; Delorme 1992）。重要的是，调节不仅依赖于国家强制力的使用，而且始终需要一定程度的社会共识和自愿遵循，以便相对持久。当Max Weber将国家描述为合法物理暴力的垄断者时，他——如Gramsci后来特别强调的——指出了每种统治关系中强制和共识的紧密联系（Gramsci 1986, 199ff）。因此，相对稳定的积累和调节关系的建立依赖于政治-意识形态的霸权。国家作为正式与社会、其社会对立和阶级分离、面对个体化国民自成一体的实体，这一形式本身就是政治合法性的一个重要基础。通过这种方式，国家可以被视为“公共利益”的中立管理者。在资产阶级民主条件下，这种合法性联系通常特别有效。通过将阶级冲突纳入与资本积累相容的形式，从而稳定物质生产过程，调节在受影响的人群中几乎不断地为自己辩护。因此，调节的危机总是带有国家、政治系统和霸权危机的可能性。"},{"prompt":"请将“Will man den Prozess der Regulation und die Rolle des Staates dabei verstehen, dann darf allerdings nicht nur der Staatsapparat im engeren Sinne, das so genannte politisch-adiministrative System betrachtet werden. Neben diesem »engeren« kann man mit Gramsci von einem »erweiterten« Staat sprechen, der den ganzen Komplex der »zivilen Gesellschaft« umfasst. Das ist das verzweigte Netzwerk der vom Staat formell mehr oder weniger unabhängigen Organisationen und freiwilligen Zusammenschlüsse, die der Formulierung und Vertretung gesellschaftlicher Interessen, der politischen Willensbildung, der Meinungsäußerung und der öffentlichen Diskussion dienen: Parteien, Verbände, Interessengruppen, Kirchen, Universitäten, Medien, Vereine, Clubs, Bürgerinitiativen, Intellektuellenzirkel, »think tanks« u.v.a.m. Neben und mit dem Staat im engeren Sinne ist diese »zivile Gesellschaft« ein Bestandteil des regulativen Systems, insofern dort Interessen organisiert, gesellschaftliche Prozesse - zum Beispiel durch Tarifverträge - geregelt, allgemeine Wert- und Ordnungsvorstellungen gebildet und insofern zwischen »Staat« und »Gesellschaft« vermittelt wird. Nicht alle Formen politischer Regulation vollziehen sich direkt mit Hilfe des Staatsapparats, denn immer besteht daneben ein wesentlicher Bereich gesellschaftlicher »Selbstverwaltung« wie z.B. in der Lohnpolitik. Der Staatsapparat bleibt indessen als Garant der »Spielregeln« und als Bestätigungs- und Sanktionsinstanz auch hier immer gegenwärtig. Dies weist noch einmal darauf hin, dass die geläufige Entgegensetzung von »Staat« als Zwangsapparat und »ziviler Gesellschaft« als Ort von Freiheit und Demokratie unhaltbar ist. Bei genauerer Betrachtung handelt es sich bei beiden um von der Struktur der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft bestimmte Bestandteile des institutionellen Regulationssystems, mittels dessen Herrschaft stabilisiert und der Akkumulati-onsprozess des Kapitals garantiert werden kann. Die Institutionen der zivilen Gesellschaft sind selbst von ökonomischen Macht- und politischen Herrschaftsverhältnissen geprägt und bei allen Gegensätzen und Reibungen bleiben beide Sphären eng aufeinander bezogen. Der Staat garantiert die Strukturen der zivilen Gesellschaft (etwa die gewerkschaftliche Ko-alitionsfreiheit oder das Privateigentum) und ohne diese, d.h. ohne die sich in ihr entwickelnden Prozesse der politischen Legitimation und der Interessenkanalisierung könnte politische Herrschaft keine lange Dauer haben. Die »zivile« Gesellschaft ist daher ein Teil des »integralen Staates«. Gramsci definiert ihn als »den gesamten Komplex praktischer und theoretischer Aktivitäten, mit denen die herrschende Klasse ihre Dominanz nicht nur rechtfertigt und aufrechterhält, sondern den aktiven Konsens der Beherrschten gewinnt« (ebd., 244; Ubers, d. Verf.). Und in der Tat sind die Übergänge zwischen »Staat« und »ziviler Gesellschaft« fließend, wie sich an der formellen oder informellen Staatsförmigkeit von Verbänden und Medien (Handelskammern, Kirchen, Rundfunkanstalten usw.), aber auch daran leicht erkennen lässt, dass viele Massenverbände und insbesondere die Parteien längst zu - auch finanziell weitgehend abhängigen - Quasi-Staatsapparaten geworden sind. Gleichwohl bilden »Staat« und »zivile Gesellschaft«, also der Gesamt-komplex des institutionellen Regulationssystems, keinen einheitlichen und geschlossenen, sondern einen höchst komplexen und konfliktreichen Zusammenhang, geprägt durch unterschiedliche Zugangs- und Aktions-möglichkeiten, Interessengegensätze und Konfliktebenen. Gerade diese Offenheit und die damit bewirkte Institutionalisierung gegenläufiger und sich überlagernder Interessen macht Regulation, den vorübergehenden Ausgleich antagonistischer Interessen und die Anpassung konfliktorischen Handelns an die Bedingungen der Kapitalakkumulation möglich. Das gilt beispielsweise für die »Tarifpartner«, die unter dem Druck der Regierung, der Medienöffentlichkeit oder einschlägiger wissenschaftlicher Sachverständiger »standortsichernde« Lohnvereinbarungen schließen und dabei versuchen müssen, deren Folgen ihren jeweiligen Mitgliedern plausibel zu machen. Und es gilt ebenso für die Parteien, die im Wechselspiel von Regierung und Opposition die Hoffnung aufrecht erhalten, Wahlversprechungen würden irgendwann einmal erfüllt. Sorgt die »zivile Gesellschaft« somit im Sinne Gramscis für den zur Stabilisierung kapitalistischer Herrschaftsverhältnisse notwendigen »Kitt«, so ist sie aber auch das Feld, auf dem demokratische Prozesse und emanzipative Bewegungen überhaupt erst entstehen können. Hier besteht zumindest prinzipiell die Möglichkeit des freien politischen Zusammenschlusses, der Meinungsäußerung, der Diskussion und Uberzeugung. Insofern sind »zivilgesellschaftliche« Strukturen in der Tat ein Dreh- und Angelpunkt von Demokratie unter bürgerlich-kapitalistischen Verhältnissen. Zugleich bleibt aber der institutionelle Komplex der Regulation selbst ein Herrschaftsverhältnis, das von den sozialen Strukturen und Gegensätzen der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft geprägt wird. Wer die Wirksamkeit seiner politischen Überzeugung mit der eines Medienkonzerns vergleicht, wird das ebenso schnell herausfinden wie diejenigen, die sich nicht an die Regeln des liberaldemokratischen politischen Spiels halten und zu »außer«- oder gar »anti«-parlamentarischen Formen von Politik greifen. Das heißt, dass sich demokratische Prozesse innerhalb dieses Feldes zwar herausbilden, aber nur insofern weiterreichende Bedeutung gewinnen können, wenn sie die herrschenden institutionellen Strukturen - also die gegebenen ökonomischen und politischen Formen, das Verhältnis von »Staat« und »Gesellschaft«, von »Politik und Ökonomie« - praktisch in Frage stellen. Die in der Bundesrepublik am Beginn der 1990er Jahre aufgeflammte »Zivilgesellschafts«-Debatte hat daran gekrankt, dass dieser Widerspruch überhaupt nicht wahrgenommen worden ist (vgl. stellvertretend für viele Rödel u.a. 1989). Auch die Struktur und Funktionsweise des regulativen Systems wird durch den für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft bestimmenden Widerspruch von »Klassen«- und »Marktvergesellschaftung« bestimmt. Die Menschen nehmen »objektive« Stellungen in der vorhandenen Sozial- und Klassenstruktur ein und verfügen zugleich als formell freie und gleiche Markt- und Rechtssubjekte über einige Spielräume für die Art und Weise ihrer Interessenäußerung und Lebensgestaltung. Dies erst ermöglicht es, dass gesellschaftliche Antagonismen nicht nur die Klassenkonflikte, sondern ebenso Geschlechterverhältnisse, ethnische, religiöse und kulturelle Gegensätze »regulierbar«, d.h. mit dem Zusammenhalt der Gesellschaft und dem Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals vereinbar gemacht werden können. Die kapitalistische Vergesellschaftungsweise bestimmt wesentlich die Ausdrucksformen und Verbindungen dieser Gegensätze. Frauen bleiben beispielsweise als Geschlechtsangehörige in ihren sozialen Orientierungen und Handlungsmöglichkeiten an die bestehenden gesellschaftlichen Formen gebunden: Lohnverhältnis, Familie, Geld, Recht und Staat. Un-ternehmerverbände sind Vertretungen »des« Kapitals und Zusammenschlüsse konkurrierender Privatproduzenten, Gewerkschaften sowohl Organisationen »der« Arbeiterklasse als auch freie Vereinigungen miteinander konkurrierender Arbeitsplatzbesitzerinnen. Die Familie schließlich ist der Ort, in dem Klassenpositionen produziert und reproduziert werden, Individualität und Emotionalität sich entwickeln kann und geschlechtsspezifische Sozialisation und Arbeitsteilung ihre Basis haben. Der für die kapitalistische Vergesellschaftungsweise charakteristische Indivi- dualisierungs- und Vereinzelungseffekt schafft die Möglichkeit einer quer zu den sozialen Antagonismen und Klassenstrukturen liegenden Bildung, Verbindung und Aufspaltung von Interessen (vgl. Mouffe 1982; Poulant- zas 2002; Jessop 1985, 63ff.; Holloway 1991, 242ff.). Dies ist eine entscheidende Bedingung der Möglichkeit, soziales Handeln mit den Bedingungen der Kapitalakkumulation vereinbar zu machen. Individualisierung und Vereinzelung werden von den Institutionen des regulativen Systems bestätigt und verfestigt, zugleich aber auch in spezifischer Weise - etwa mittels des Staates oder verbandlicher Zusammenschlüsse -aufgehoben. Konkurrenz, sozialer Antagonismus und Gemeinschaftlichkeit gelangen im Prozess der Regulation zu einer widersprüchlichen und konflikthaften Einheit. Die Interessen, die darin zum Ausdruck kommen, wurzeln zwar in den gegensätzlichen gesellschaftlichen Lagen, werden aber durch die herrschende Vergesellschaftungsweise in eine bestimmte Ausdrucksform gebracht. Es entstehen nach Marktstellung, Geschlecht, Religionszugehörigkeit, kulturellen Traditionen usw. voneinander geschiedene und sich gegenüberstehende Einzelinteressen, die in der staatlichen Apparatur, bürokratischen Organisationen, kommerzialisierten Medien usw. in jeweils besonderer Weise zum Ausdruck kommen. Daraus ergibt sich, dass es kein ursprüngliches soziales Interesse außerhalb des existierenden Systems von Regulation gibt. Welche Interessen wie, wann und wo tatsächlich in Erscheinung treten, hängt von der Struktur der regulativen Apparatur ab.”翻译为中文","completion":"如果想要理解调节过程及其中国家的作用，就不能仅仅关注所谓的政治行政系统，即国家机器的狭义概念。除了这个“狭义”的概念之外，可以用Gramsci的话来说，还有一个“广义”的国家，它包括了整个“民间社会”复杂体。这是一个由国家形式上或多或少独立的组织和自愿联合体构成的错综复杂的网络，它们服务于社会利益的制定和代表、政治意愿的形成、意见表达和公共讨论：党派、联盟、利益团体、教会、大学、媒体、俱乐部、社区组织、知识分子圈子、“智库”等等。与狭义的国家并存，这个“民间社会”是调节系统的一部分，因为在这里组织利益、通过例如劳资协议来调节社会过程、形成一般性的价值和秩序观念，从而在“国家”和“社会”之间进行调解。并不是所有形式的政治调节都直接借助国家机器完成，因为总是存在一个关键的社会“自我管理”的领域，如工资政策。然而，国家机器作为“游戏规则”的保障者和认证及处罚的机构，在这里仍然处于现场。这再次指出，将“国家”作为强制机器与将“民间社会”视为自由和民主之地的常见对立是站不住脚的。更仔细的考察显示，二者都是受资本主义社会结构决定的制度性调节系统的组成部分，通过这一系统，统治得以稳定，资本的积累过程得以确保。民间社会的机构本身就受经济权力和政治统治关系的影响，在所有的对立和摩擦中，两个领域仍然紧密相关。国家保障民间社会的结构（例如工会的联合自由或私有财产权），若没有这些，即没有其中发展出的政治合法性和利益渠道化过程，政治统治就难以长久。因此，“民间”社会是“整体国家”的一部分。Gramsci将其定义为“支配阶级不仅用以辩护和维持其统治，而且用以赢得被统治者的积极共识的全部实践和理论活动的总和”（同上，244；作者翻译）。实际上，“国家”与“民间社会”之间的界限是流动的，这不仅可以从组织和媒体（如商会、教会、广播机构等）的正式或非正式国家形式看出，也可以从许多大众联盟特别是党派已经变成——包括财政上——高度依赖的准国家机构看出。 尽管如此，“国家”和“民间社会”，即制度性调节系统的整体，并不形成一个统一且封闭的体系，而是一个高度复杂且充满冲突的结构，其特点是不同的接入和行动可能性、利益对立和冲突层面。正是这种开放性和因此形成的对立和互相交叠利益的制度化，使得调节、暂时调和对立利益和根据资本积累条件调整冲突行为成为可能。例如“劳资双方”，在政府、媒体公众或相关科学专家的压力下，达成“保障工作地点”的工资协议，并尝试使其成员理解协议的后果。对于政党来说也是如此，它们在政府和反对派的互动中保持选举承诺最终会实现的希望。 因此，按照Gramsci的说法，“民间社会”为资本主义统治关系的稳定提供了必需的“粘合剂”，但它也是民主进程和解放运动首次可能出现的场地。至少在原则上，这里存在自由政治结合、意见表达、讨论和说服的可能性。在这一点上，“民间社会”结构确实是资本主义条件下民主的核心。同时，调节机构的复杂体本身仍然是一种受资本主义社会的社会结构和对立影响的统治关系。比较一个人的政治信念的有效性与媒体集团的有效性，或是那些不遵循自由民主政治游戏规则，转而采取“非正统”或甚至“反议会”的政治形式的人将会很快发现这一点。这意味着，尽管民主进程可以在这个领域内形成，但只有当它们实际上质疑现有的制度结构——即给定的经济和政治形式，“国家”与“社会”的关系，“政治与经济”的关系——时，才能获得进一步的意义。上世纪90年代初在德国爆发的“民间社会”辩论之所以出现问题，是因为完全没有意识到这种矛盾（参考Rödel等人，1989为代表）。 制度性调节系统的结构和功能同样由资本主义社会“阶级”与“市场社会化”的决定性矛盾所决定。人们以“客观”的方式占据现有的社会和阶级结构的位置，并且同时作为形式上自由平等的市场和法律主体，拥有以某种方式表达其利益和安排其生活的一些空间。正是这一点使得社会对立，不仅是阶级冲突，而且包括性别关系、种族、宗教和文化差异，“可调节”的，即能与社会的凝聚力和资本积累过程相容。资本主义的社会化方式对这些对立的表现形式和连接起了决定性作用。例如，女性作为性别成员在其社会取向和行动能力上仍受现有社会形式的约束：工资关系、家庭、金钱、法律和国家。企业协会是“资本”的代表和竞争性私营生产者的联合体，工会既是“工人阶级”的组织，也是彼此竞争的工作场所所有者的自由联合体。最后，家庭是产生和再产生阶级位置的地方，个性和情感可以发展，以及性别特定的社会化和分工有其基础。资本主义社会化方式的特点是个体化和孤立效应，这创造了一个横跨社会对立和阶级结构的利益形成、连接和分裂的可能性（参见Mouffe 1982; Poulantzas 2002; Jessop 1985, 63ff.; Holloway 1991, 242ff.）。这是使得社会行动与资本积累条件相容的决定性条件。个体化和孤立由调节系统的机构确认和加固，但同时也以特定方式——例如通过国家或联盟的结合——被解除。在调节过程中，竞争、社会对立和社区性达到了一个矛盾且冲突的统一。其中体现的利益虽然根源于不同的社会状况，但通过统治的社会化方式被引入了特定的表达形式。市场地位、性别、宗教归属、文化传统等形成了彼此分离且相对立的个别利益，这些在国家机构、官僚组织、商业化媒体等中以特定方式表现。因此，没有原始的社会利益存在于现有的调节系统之外。哪些利益何时何地如何实际出现，取决于调节装置的结构。"},{"prompt":"请将“Der Regulationsprozess beinhaltet immer ein komplexes Verhältnis von Integration und Ausschluss, von Einbindung und Spaltung. Er schafft gewissermaßen ein Auswahlraster, das maßgebend dafür ist, welche Interessen auf welchen Ebenen und in welcher Form zum Ausdruck kommen und wirksam werden können. Dadurch entstehen regelmäßig »korporative« Strukturen, die quer zu grundlegenden Klassengegensätzen liegende Interessenverbindungen privilegieren, also etwa »deutsche« Ar- beitehmerInnen gegenüber »Ausländerinnen«, Männer gegenüber Frauen, »Modernisierungsgewinner« gegenüber »Modernisierungsopfern«. Jedes Regulationssystem ist in seiner konkreten institutionellen Gestalt das Ergebnis von sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen und Kämpfen und gleichzeitig wirkt es auf diese - die Ebenen der Auseinandersetzung, die politischen Möglichkeiten unterschiedlicher sozialer Gruppen - zurück. Beispielsweise hat die Existenz von Gewerkschaften, Tarifverträgen und sozialstaatlichen Einrichtungen einige Auswirkungen bezüglich dessen, was »Klassenkampf« konkret heißt und wie er zum Ausdruck kommt. Fassen wir zusammen: Wenn davon ausgegangen werden kann, dass Regulation im Grundsatz die Herstellung von sozialen Beziehungen und die vorübergehende Festschreibung von Kräfteverhältnissen durch die bestehenden gesellschaftlichen Antagonismen hindurch und über diese hinweg bedeutet, dann geschieht dies immer und notwendig mittels eines komplexen Systems von Interessenspaltungen und sozialen Ausgrenzungen. Dies vor allem macht es möglich, dass die kapitalistische Gesellschaft über ihre Antagonismen und Widersprüche hinweg Bestand und Dauer erhält. Ein Zustand allgemeiner Harmonie, von Freiheit und Gleichheit ist dies nicht, wie die Rede von »demokratischer Zivilgesellschaft« manchmal unterstellt. Kapitalistische Regulation bleibt ein Ausbeutungs- und Unterdrückungszusammenhang, der nur durch soziale Kämpfe veränderbar ist und dessen Aufhebung an die Beseitigung der herrschenden gesellschaftlichen Strukturen gebunden bleibt. Regulation und Hegemonie Entwicklung und Erhalt kapitalistischer Gesellschaften ist also an die Existenz eines Regulationssystems gebunden, das in seinen institutionellen Formen äußerst komplex, verzweigt und widersprüchlich ist. Sowohl der Staat im engeren Sinne als auch die »zivile Gesellschaft« sind keine geschlossenen Einheiten, sondern Ansammlungen teilweise konkurrierender und gegensätzlicher Institutionen, Apparate und Organisationen. Dieses regulative System stellt den Rahmen bereit, in dem die in vieler Hinsicht gegensätzlichen sozialen Lagen und Interessen sowohl gegeneinander ausgespielt als auch kompromisshaft miteinander verbunden werden können. Dies allerdings bedeutet, dass sein Zusammenhalt, sein »Funktionieren« im Sinne des Erhalts und der Weiterentwicklung der Gesellschaft grundsätzlich unsicher bleibt. Es stellt sich daher die Frage, wie über alle institutionellen Gegensätze und Konflikte hinaus die relative Einheitlichkeit der Staatsapparatur, die Verbindung von »Staat« und »ziviler Gesellschaft« und damit zusammenhängend die Zustimmung und Folgebereitschaft der in viele Interessengegensätze verstrickten Individuen gewährleistet werden kann. Die Struktur des regulativen Systems schafft dafür wichtige Voraussetzungen, aber keine Garantie. Auch staatliche Gewaltanwendung, bürokratische Verfahrensregeln, Gesetze oder materielle Leistungen können dies kaum allein bewirken. Es bedarf darüber hinaus immer noch eines die vorhandene institutionelle Apparatur und die darin eingeschriebenen sozialen Praktiken stützenden und legitimierenden, die Individuen und sozialen Gruppen einbeziehenden Konsenses. Historische Formationen des Kapitalismus sind daher immer mit »hegemonialen Projekten« (Jessop 1982, 243ff.) verbunden, die die jeweilige Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise zu einer spezifischen Entwicklungsweise oder einem »historischen Block« (Gramsci) zusammenfügen. Ganz allgemein bedeutet Hegemonie die Fähigkeit, verallgemeinerte, Klassen und soziale Gruppen übergreifende Vorstellungen von der richtigen Ordnung und Entwicklung der Gesellschaft durchzusetzen, d.h. dem Glauben eine Grundlage zu verleihen, die bestehende Ordnung und ihre Entwicklungsperspektiven seien im allgemeinen, auch untergeordnete Teile der Gesellschaft einbeziehenden Interesse. Ein hegemoniales Verhältnisses weist dabei mehrere Dimensionen auf: • eine ideologische, d.h. die als beherrschend durchgesetzten Wert- und Ordnungsvorstellungen; • eine politische, d.h. die Fähigkeit, diese Vorstellungen in einer über-zeugenden und breitere Volksschichten auch materiell einbindenden Weise in die Praxis umzusetzen; • eine institutionelle, die sich auf die Bestimmung der institutionellen Terrains und Zugangsregeln für politische Aushandlungs- und Entschei-dungsprozesse bezieht. Grundsätzlich sind es die sozialen Formen der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft selbst, auf denen die Hegemonie der ökonomisch herrschenden Klassen beruht und die sie möglich machen. Die »Besonderung« des Staates als Verkörperung des Gemeinwesens gegenüber allen Klassen und gegenüber den individualisierten Staatsbürgerinnen ist eine entscheidende Voraussetzung dafür, dass eine umfassendere »Politik des Kapitals« über Konkurrenz und Klassengegensatz hinweg überhaupt formulierbar und durchsetzbar ist. Dies schließt in der Regel materielle Zugeständnisse an die Beherrschten ein, die indessen den einzelnen Kapitalisten in der Regel durch die staatliche Zwangsgewalt aufgezwungen werden müssen (Pou- lantzas 2002, Gramsci 1986, 161). Der Charakter des Staates als formeller Verkörperung des gesellschaftlich Allgemeinen macht es möglich und notwendig, eine die herrschenden gesellschaftlichen Strukturen und den Kapitalverwertungsprozess garantierende Politik in die Form eines »national-popularen« Programms zu kleiden. Das bedeutet, dass plausibel gemacht werden muss, dass die Durchsetzung kapitalistischer Ziele zugleich allgemeinen, »nationalen« Interessen dient, dass also z.B. die Vernichtung von Arbeitsplätzen dem wirtschaftlichen Wachstum und damit letztendlich dem Interesse aller zugute kommt. Dies darf freilich nicht als willkürliche Strategie der Herrschenden verstanden werden. Weil konkrete Interessen nicht unabhängig von und vor der Regulation existieren und sich erst in dieser selbst herausbilden, bildet der Regulationsprozess in seiner jeweils bestehenden Form die Grundlage hegemonialer Strategien und bestimmt ihre Inhalte und Möglichkeiten. Wenn also der Staat als »Organ« einer Klasse angesehen werden kann, dann nur in dem Sinne, als deren Entfaltung, die er politisch abstützt, als Grundlage und Motor einer allgemeinen, nicht nur ihre bornierten Interessen berücksichtigenden gesellschaftlichen Entwicklung erscheint (Gramsci 1986,182). Sowohl die allgemeine Struktur der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft als auch die jeweils herrschende Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise bilden die Grundlage von Hegemonie, ohne allerdings notwendigerweise ein bestimmtes »hegemoniales Projekt« hervorzubringen. Vielmehr bezeichnen sie eine Bedingungskonstellation, die durchaus unterschiedliche hegemoniale Strategien zulässt. Zugleich ist die Herausbildung einer bestimmten Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise selbst nicht unabhängig von der Art und Weise, wie ein hegemoniales Projekt formuliert und durch soziale Kompromisse stabilisiert wird. Die Herausbildung von Hegemonie und die Durchsetzung konkreter Akkumulationsund Regulationsweisen ist damit ein sich wechselseitig bedingender und vermittelnder Prozess. Jedes Akkumulationsregime und jede Regulationsweise bedarf einer hegemonialen Abstützung, um Kontur und relative Stabilität zu gewinnen. Die Möglichkeit zur Formulierung und Durchsetzung eines »natio- nal-popularen Programms« beruht auf der realen Vielfältigkeit und Ge-gensätzlichkeit der sozialen Lagen und der Herausbildung dazu querliegender Formen von Interessenartikulation und -organisation. Damit wird es möglich, »eine Vielzahl ideologischer Elemente, die von unterschiedlichen sozialen Kräften ausgedrückt werden, erfolgreich zu einem relativ einheitlichen ideologischen Ganzen zusammenzuführen.« (Jessop 1985, 345f.; Übers, d. Verf.) Jessop bezeichnet Hegemonie als »Entwicklung eines politischen Projektes, das von anderen Subjekten als wichtig für die Realisierung ihrer Interessen anerkannt wird, und einer »organischen Ideologie*, die als gemeinsamer ideologischer Bezugsrahmen dienen kann, in dem eine Vielzahl von Subjekten Bedürfnisse zu redefinieren und zu verhandeln in der Lage ist.« (Jessop 1982,199, Übers, d. Verf.) Dies geschieht nicht naturwüchsig, sondern ist das Ergebnis durchaus bewusster Strategien. Allerdings verbietet gerade die kapitalistische Vergesellschaftungsweise die Herausbildung eines einheitlichen und bestimmenden Akteurs, der in der Lage ist, die Gesellschaft auch im ideologischen Sinne bewusst zu gestalten. Hegemoniale Projekte entstehen deshalb aus einer Kombination und Verdichtung widersprüchlicher Diskurse, die ihren Ort und ihre Träger im institutionellen System der Regulation haben und von dessen Struktur geprägt werden.”翻译为中文","completion":"调节过程总是涉及到一种复杂的结合与排除、纳入与分裂的关系。它有点像创建了一个筛选网，决定了哪些利益在哪些层面上以及以什么形式得以表达和生效。因此，常常形成了“公司式”的结构，这些结构偏袒跨越基本阶级对立的利益联结，例如偏袒“德国”的劳动者而不是“外国人”，偏袒男性而不是女性，“现代化的赢家”而不是“现代化的牺牲者”。每个调节系统的具体制度形式都是社会力量关系和斗争的结果，同时它还反作用于这些——冲突的层面，不同社会群体的政治可能性。例如，工会、集体协议和社会福利机构的存在对于“阶级斗争”具体意味着什么以及如何表现都有一定影响。 概括来说：如果可以认为，调节原则上意味着通过现存的社会对立实现社会关系的建立和暂时固定力量关系，那么这总是和必然通过一个复杂的利益分裂和社会排斥系统来完成的。这种方式使得资本主义社会能够维持其对立和矛盾。这并不是一个普遍和谐、自由和平等的状态，正如有时提到的“民主民间社会”所假定的那样。资本主义的调节保持着一种剥削和压迫的关系，只能通过社会斗争来改变，并且其废除依赖于消除现有的社会结构。 调节与霸权 因此，资本主义社会的发展和维持依赖于存在一个制度形式极其复杂、多样和矛盾的调节系统。无论是狭义的国家还是“民间社会”，都不是封闭的单元，而是由部分竞争和对立的机构、设备和组织组成的集合。这个调节系统提供了一个框架，在这个框架中，多方面对立的社会位置和利益可以相互抵消，也可以妥协地连接在一起。然而，这意味着它的凝聚力、它的“运作”以维持和发展社会的意义上，基本上是不确定的。 因此，问题在于，如何在所有制度性对立和冲突之外，确保国家机构的相对统一性，确保“国家”与“民间社会”的联系，以及与之相关的，确保被卷入多重利益对立的个体的认同和遵从。调节系统的结构为此创造了重要的前提，但没有保障。 单靠国家的使用暴力、官僚程序规则、法律或物质利益也难以实现这一目标。需要的是，除此之外还需要一个支持现有制度设备和其中所嵌入的社会实践的共识，使个人和社会群体参与其中并获得正当性。因此，历史上的资本主义形态总是与“霸权项目”（Jessop 1982, 243ff.）相联系，这些项目将特定的积累和调节方式团结成特定的发展方式或“历史集合”（Gramsci）。 一般来说，霸权意味着能够建立跨越阶级和社会群体的关于社会正确秩序和发展的普遍观念，并使相信现有秩序及其发展前景是包括社会下层在内的普遍利益中的基础。霸权关系具有多重维度： - 一种意识形态维度，即作为主导的价值观和秩序观念； - 一种政治维度，即将这些观念以一种令人信服的方式和在更广泛的人民中也能够实现物质利益的绑定方式付诸实践的能力； - 一种制度维度，即涉及为政治谈判和决策过程确定制度领域和入场规则的能力。 从根本上说，正是资本主义社会的社会形式本身，构成了经济统治阶级霸权的基础，并使其成为可能。国家作为代表从所有阶级中和面对个体化的国民代表共同体的特别化是能够制定和实施超越竞争和阶级对立的更广泛的“资本政策”的一个关键条件。这通常包括对被统治者的物质让步，这些让步通常需要通过国家强制力强加给各个资本家（Poulantzas 2002, Gramsci 1986, 161）。 国家作为社会普遍性的正式体现，成为了确保支持社会统治结构和资本增值过程的政策以“民族-大众”计划的形式出现的可能性和必要性。这意味着必须使人们相信，实现资本主义目标同时服务于普遍的“民族”利益，例如，裁员有利于经济增长，最终有利于所有人的利益。这当然不应被理解为统治者的任意策略。因为具体利益并非独立于调节之外并在调节中才形成，调节过程以其现存形式为霸权策略提供了基础，并确定了它们的内容和可能性。 如果国家可以被视为某个阶级的“器官”，那只能是在它政治上支持的发展，作为一般的、不仅是考虑自身狭隘利益的社会发展的基础和驱动力的意义上（Gramsci 1986,182）。资本主义社会的总体结构和当前的积累与调节方式构成了霸权的基础，但不必然导致特定的“霸权项目”。相反，它们标志着一个条件配置，它允许不同的霸权策略。同时，特定积累和调节方式的形成本身也不独立于霸权项目的阐述以及通过社会妥协的稳定。霸权的形成和具体积累及调节方式的实施因此是一个相互条件和中介的过程。每个积累制度和调节方式都需要霸权支持，以获得轮廓和相对稳定性。 能够制定和实施“民族-大众”计划的可能性基于社会位置的实际多样性和对立性以及横向形成的利益表达和组织形式。这样，就可以将“来自不同社会力量表达的多样意识形态元素成功地整合成相对统一的意识形态整体。”（Jessop 1985, 345f.; 译者翻译）Jessop 将霸权定义为“被其他主体认为对实现其利益重要的政治项目的发展，以及可以作为一个共同的意识形态参考框架，使得多种主体能够重新定义和协商需求的‘有机意识形态’。”（Jessop 1982,199, 译者翻译）这不是自然发生的，而是通过完全意识到的策略的结果。然而，正是资本主义的社会化方式禁止了形成一个统一和决定性的行动者，能够在意识形态意义上有意识地塑造社会。因此，霸权项目产生于矛盾话语的组合和密集化，它们在调节系统的制度框架内找到它们的位置和承担者，并受其结构的影响。"},{"prompt":"请将“Grundlage dafür ist, dass jedes Individuum im Hinblick auf seine »objektive« Lage »Sitz einer Pluralität von Bestimmungen ist« (Mouffe 1982, 32), die von unterschiedlichen Klassenpositionen, Geschlechtszugehörigkeiten, kulturellen Traditionen und sozialen Milieubindungen geprägt sind. Dies bedeutet, dass die Menschen sozusagen im Schnittpunkt einer Vielzahl sehr unterschiedlicher und oft gegensätzlicher »Diskurse« stehen, sei es als Autofahrerinnen, Arbeitnehmer, Hausfrauen, Eigenheimbesitzer, Kirchgänger oder als Besitzerinnen eines deutschen Passes. Hegemonie beruht darin, diese vielfältigen und widersprüchlichen Orientierungen in bestimmter Weise zu formen, zusammenzufügen und so zu verbinden, dass daraus eine allgemein prägende und das gesellschaftlich-politische Bewusstsein bestimmende Vorstellung von der Welt, ihrer richtigen Ordnung und der wünschbaren Entwicklung ihrer Verhältnisse entsteht. Hegemoniale Projekte oder Diskurse werden nicht unabhängig von den herrschenden materiellen Bedingungen und gesellschaftlichen Strukturen erfunden oder geschaffen. Sie werden aus einem bereits existierenden und gestaltbaren ideologischen Material konstruiert. Dieser Prozess ist als ein nie endender Kampf, als eine Auseinandersetzung zwischen verschiedenen Personen und Gruppen und ihren wahrgenommenen Interessen zu verstehen. Hegemonie im Sinne einer »organischen Ideologie« ist somit das Ergebnis einer diskursiven Formung, Mobilisierung, Spaltung, Dethematisierung und Kombination von Interessen, ein Prozess, der viele Akteure und offene Spielräume hat, aber von der konkreten Gestalt der herrschenden Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise geprägt wird und zugleich auf diese zurückwirkt. Hegemoniale Strategien beziehen sich im Kern immer auf den Staatsapparat und sind - als Grundlage »politischer Führung« - eine Bedingung seiner Kohärenz und Einheitlichkeit. Aber sie haben in diesem weder ihre entscheidende Basis noch ihren Ursprung. Wie Gramsci gezeigt hat, entsteht Hegemonie vor allem auf dem Feld der »societa civile«. Wenn Parteien erfolgreich eine »geistig-moralische« Führerschaft reklamieren, dann stützen sie sich dabei in der Regel auf ein intellektuelles Umfeld, das sie selbst weder geschaffen haben noch unbedingt genau kennen. Dies verweist schließlich auf die wichtige Position der Intellektuellen im Prozess der Regulation. Die Trennung von körperlicher und geistiger Arbeit und die immer weitere Ausdifferenzierung dieser Arbeitsteilung gehört zur Grundstruktur des kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisses. Damit verbindet sich die Möglichkeit zur Entstehung sehr unterschiedlicher Arten professioneller Gesellschaftsinterpreten und Konzeptemacher, die ein wichtiges Fundament von Regulation darstellt. Dies erst erlaubt nämlich die Formulierung von Diskursen, die von unmittelbaren Interessenlagen und sozialen Kräftekonstellationen relativ unabhängig sind, neu geformt und kombiniert und damit zur Grundlage hegemonialer Projekte gemacht werden können. Der Raum für die Verselbständigung ideologischer Diskurse ist indessen begrenzt. Immer bleiben sie zurückgebunden an materielle soziale Lagen, Praktiken und Erfahrungen. Sie können nicht unabhängig von der konkreten Struktur der Akkumulationsund Regulationsweise und der Position der Individuen innerhalb dieser entwickelt werden. Die Verdichtung widersprüchlicher und sich überschneidender Diskurse zu einem hegemonialen Projekt ist das Ergebnis ideologischer und materieller Kämpfe. Hegemoniale Projekte können sich nie unabhängig von der materiellen Struktur einer gegebenen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise entwickeln und prägen diese gleichzeitig in ihrer konkreten Gestalt. D eshalb sind es vor allem die Krisen historischer kapitalistischer Formationen, die ideologische Kämpfe aufflammen lassen und die zugleich die materiellen Bedingungen schaffen, auf die sich neue hegemoniale Projekte beziehen können. Internationale Regulation, Dominanz und Abhängigkeit im kapitalistischen Weltsystem Auf der Ebene der einzelnen Staaten und in Abgrenzung nach außen können sich am ehesten die auf eine institutionalisierte Einheit von Konsens und Zwang gestützten Regulationsweisen herausbilden. Dies ist der Grund dafür, weshalb die einzelstaatlich organisierten Gesellschaften einen Ausgangspunkt der Kapitalismusanalyse darstellen (Lipietz 1985). Entscheidende Veränderungsdynamiken der internationalen politischen und ökonomischen Beziehungen gehen von den Entwicklungs- und Krisenprozessen nationaler Formationen aus (Mistral 1986, 170ff.). Weil damit die Bedeutung einzelstaatlicher Regulationszusammenhänge mit den sie charakterisierenden politischen Institutionen und Prozessen besonders betont wird, steht der Regulationsansatz in einem gewissen Gegensatz zur so genannten Weltsystemtheorie (vgl. dazu insbesondere Wallerstein/ Hopkins 1984; Wallerstein 1985) und hebt sie auch von traditionellen imperialismus- oder dependenztheoretischen Beschreibungen des globalen Kapitalismus ab (vgl. Boeckh 1992). Gleichwohl bilden sich die ein-zelstaatlichen Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhänge von Beginn an im Rahmen eines kapitalistischen Weltmarkts und sind in grenzüberschreitende Verflechtungszusammenhänge, Austauschprozesse und ökonomische, politische und militärische Abhängigkeiten eingebettet. Ökonomische und politische Prozesse auf internationaler Ebene sind nicht einfach Folgen des Zusammenspiels isolierter nationaler Gesellschaften, sondern weisen eigene Strukturen und Dynamiken auf, die auf diese zurückwirken. Dies beruht darauf, dass die Klassenverhältnisse immer durch den Widerspruch von »Globalisierung« und »Verstaatlichung« , d.h. die Spaltung von Klassenlagen entlang einzelstaatlicher Grenzen bestimmt sind. Das Problem des Zusammenhangs und der Verbindung von Akkumulation und Regulation stellt sich daher nicht nur auf nationalstaatlicher, sondern ebenso auf Weltmarktebene. Der globale Kapitalismus stellt eine komplexe Verknüpfung gesellschaftlich-politischer Einheiten mit je eigenen, aber miteinander in Beziehung stehenden und voneinander abhängigen Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen dar. Wichtig ist, wie diese miteinander verknüpft sind und wie sich die Dynamik der globalen Akkumulation mit der Regulation des Weltmarkts und mit den einzelstaatlichen Regulationszusammenhängen verbindet. Grundsätzlich hängt die Stabilität einzelner kapitalistischer Gesellschaften davon ab, dass es gelingt, den jeweiligen Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhang so mit den Weltmarktprozessen zu verkoppeln und in die internationale Arbeitsteilung einzugliedern, dass eine relativ störungsfreie Akkumulation des Kapitals und ökonomisches Wachstum innerhalb des einzelstaatlichen Rahmens gewährleistet werden. Die internen ökonomischen Kreisläufe müssen so mit den Außenbeziehungen verbunden werden, dass sie einen relativ gleichgewichtigen und expansiven Verlauf annehmen können. Dies steht unter der Bedingung, dass das Kapital nicht einzelstaatlich fixiert ist, sondern grundsätzlich im globalen Maßstab operiert. Seine Verwertungsdynamik steht damit in einem Gegensatz zu den räumlich fixierten politischen Organisationsformen. Wenn man von dem praktisch kaum realisierbaren Fall einer völlig autarken Wirtschaft absieht, setzt die Durchsetzung einer stabilen nationalen Ak- kumulations- und Regulationsweise voraus, dass in Verbindung mit dem Weltmarkt günstige »Standort«-, was heißt: Profitabilitäts- und Verwertungsbedingungen, geschaffen werden können.”翻译为中文","completion":"这是基于每个个体在其“客观”位置上是“多种决定因素的汇聚点”（Mouffe 1982, 32）的观点，这些决定因素受到不同阶级位置、性别、文化传统和社会环境连接的影响。这意味着人们实际上位于多样且往往相互对立的“话语”交汇点，无论是作为汽车驾驶者、雇员、家庭主妇、自有住房者、教堂成员还是持有德国护照的人。霸权在于以某种方式塑造、合并并连接这些多元且矛盾的取向，从而形成一种普遍的、决定社会政治意识的对世界、其正确秩序及其关系期望发展的观念。霸权项目或话语并非独立于统治的物质条件和社会结构发明或创造的。它们是从已存在且可塑的意识形态材料中构建的。这个过程被理解为一场永无止境的斗争，是不同个人和群体及其感知利益之间的较量。“有机意识形态”式的霸权因此是利益的话语形塑、动员、分裂、去主题化和结合的结果，这个过程有许多参与者和开放空间，但受到统治积累和调节方式的具体形态的影响，并反作用于它们。 霸权战略的核心始终关乎国家机构，作为“政治领导”的基础，是其一致性和统一性的条件。但它们既非在此找到决定性基础，也非起源于此。如Gramsci所展示的，霸权主要在“民间社会”领域形成。当党派成功声称“精神-道德”的领导地位时，它们通常依赖于一个它们既没有创造也不一定完全熟悉的知识环境。 这最终突显了知识分子在调节过程中的重要地位。身体劳动和脑力劳动的分离以及这种劳动分工的进一步细化属于资本主义生产关系的基本结构。这与能够产生各种专业的社会解释者和概念制作者的可能性相关联，这为调节提供了重要基础。这才使得能够形成与直接利益和社会力量布局相对独立的话语，重新构建和组合它们，从而成为霸权项目的基础。然而，意识形态话语的自主空间是有限的。它们始终与物质的社会状况、实践和经验相关联。它们不能独立于积累和调节方式的具体结构以及个体在这些结构中的位置来发展。 将矛盾和交叉的话语凝聚成霸权项目是意识形态和物质斗争的结果。霸权项目无法脱离给定的积累和调节方式的物质结构形成，并同时以其具体形态塑造它们。因此，特别是资本主义历史形态的危机，激发了意识形态斗争并同时创造了新霸权项目可以依托的物质条件。 国际调节、在资本主义世界体系中的支配与依赖 在单个国家的层面上以及与外部的界限内，最有可能建立基于共识和强制制度化统一的调节方式。这就是个别国家组织的社会作为资本主义分析出发点的原因（Lipietz 1985）。国际政治和经济关系的关键变革动力来自于国家形态的发展和危机过程（Mistral 1986, 170ff.）。因为这样特别强调了具有特定政治机构和过程的单个国家的调节环境的重要性，调节方式与所谓的世界体系理论（特别是Wallerstein/Hopkins 1984; Wallerstein 1985）形成了某种对立，并使其与传统的帝国主义或依赖理论描述的全球资本主义不同（参见Boeckh 1992）。然而，个别国家的积累和调节环境从一开始就在资本主义世界市场的框架内形成，并嵌入跨国的联系网、交换过程以及经济、政治和军事依赖关系中。国际层面上的经济和政治过程并不仅仅是孤立国家社会相互作用的结果，而是具有自身的结构和动力，对它们产生反作用。这是因为阶级关系总是通过“全球化”与“国家化”的矛盾界定的，即阶级位阶沿着单个国家边界的分裂。因此，积累和调节的连接与联系的问题不仅仅在国家层面，同样在世界市场层面上出现。全球资本主义构成了具有自己的、相互关联且相互依赖的积累制度和调节方式的社会政治实体的复杂网络。重要的是如何将它们相互连接以及如何将全球积累的动力与世界市场的调节和单个国家的调节环境结合起来。 个别资本主义社会的稳定性基本上取决于是否能够将特定的积累和调节环境与世界市场过程相结合，并将其融入国际分工中，以确保在单个国家框架内资本的相对无干扰积累和经济增长。内部经济循环必须与外部关系相结合，以便能够采取相对平衡和扩张性的发展路径。这是在资本本质上不受单个国家限制、基本上在全球范围内运作的条件下实现的。其增值动力与空间固定的政治组织形式相矛盾。除了实际上几乎无法实现的完全自给自足经济的情况外，建立稳定的国家积累和调节方式的实施，前提是与世界市场结合，可以创造有利的“位置”——即盈利性和增值条件。"},{"prompt":"请将“Im internationalen Maßstab kann demnach von einem doppelten Ver-knüpfungsverhältnis ausgegangen werden: Die Verbindung von Akku- mulations- und Regulationsweise, die ein einzelstaatliches Entwicklungsmodell kennzeichnet, hängt von der Art und Weise ab, wie diese in die internationale Arbeitsteilung eingebettet sind und letztere wird wiederum selbst von der Struktur und Entwicklung der nationalen Formationen bestimmt. Der globale Kapitalismus ist demnach als eine komplexe Verbindung von Prozessen auf mehreren Ebenen und mit unterschiedlichen und gegensätzlichen Akteuren - Unternehmungen, Regierungen, Verwaltungen, nichtstaatlichen Einrichtungen, internationalen Organisationen usw. - zu verstehen (Lipietz 1987, 25). Innerhalb dieses globalen Systems bestehen prinzipiell, wenn auch in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß, Spielräume für eigene nationale Entwicklungen (Mistral 1986,172ff.). Für die einzelnen Staaten »existiert ein Feld möglicher Positionen, in anderen Worten eine Reihe sich wechselseitig entsprechender nationaler Regime, aber diese Positionen sind nicht von vornherein festgelegt. Die herrschenden Klassen der verschiedenen Länder können sich auf eine ganze Reihe von >Modellen< beziehen« (Lipietz 1987,24. Übers, d. Verf.). Welche Strategie die herrschenden Klassen jeweils einschlagen, hängt wiederum von ihrer Position im globalen Konkurrenzverhältnis sowie von den internen politisch-sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen und den daraus resultierenden Bedingungen für den Umgang mit den beherrschten Klassen ab. Daraus ergibt sich die wichtige Schlussfolgerung, dass die Stellung einzelner Länder im internationalen System - der Grad von Dominanz oder Abhängigkeit - von diesen internen Verhältnissen, den sozialen Konflikt- und Kompromissstrukturen und der Form ihrer Institutionalisierung abhängt. So ist es für die ökonomischen Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten äußerst be-deutungsvoll, wie die »nationale« kapitalistische Klasse zusammengesetzt ist. Das heißt z.B., ob das Industrie- oder das Finanzkapital beherrschend, das dominierende Kapital binnenmarkt- oder exportorientiert ist oder ob mächtige konkurrierende Klassen zum Beispiel in Form von agrarischen Großgrundbesitzern existieren (vgl. dazu die interessante Gegenüberstellung der Entwicklung Dänemarks und Uruguays bei Senghaas 1982). Entscheidend ist darüber hinaus, inwieweit und in welcher Weise das Kapital international verflochten ist. Wichtig ist schließlich, in welcher Weise die Lohnarbeit entwickelt ist und ob die Lohnabhängigen organisatorisch und politisch stark genug sind, dem Kapital materielle Zugeständnisse abzuringen. Im Gegensatz zur klassischen Imperialismus-, zur Weltsystem- oder Dependenztheorie begreift der Regulationsansatz das globale kapitalistische System nicht als von einem Zentrum gesteuertes und in seiner Struktur raum-zeitlich festgeschriebenes Dominanz- und Unterordnungs- bzw. Zentrum-Peripherie-Verhältnis, sondern als veränderliches Netzwerk gegensätzlicher und zugleich miteinander verbundener einzelstaatlicher, gegebenenfalls regionaler Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhänge. Der globale Akkumulationsprozess wird durch die konkurrierenden einzelstaatlichen Formationen mit ihren spezifischen Akkumulationsund Regulationsweisen gestützt und in seinem konkreten Verlauf bestimmt. Gleichzeitig bleiben diese in ihrer inneren Struktur von den globalen ökonomischen Prozessen und der Möglichkeit ihrer Eingliederung in den Weltmarktzusammenhang abhängig. Wenn man berücksichtigt, dass die Position einzelner Länder im inter-nationalen System von der Art und Weise abhängt, wie sie ihre Regulati-onsweisen politisch und institutionell herausbilden, wie Klassenverhältnisse festgeschrieben werden und wie sich die konkrete Struktur des Staates und des politischen Systems gestaltet, dann wird es möglich, sowohl den Niedergang einstmals dominierender Metropolen (wie Großbritanniens) als auch Phänomene einer erfolgreichen »nachholenden Entwicklung« (wie etwa im Falle einiger ostasiatischer »Tigerstaaten«) zu erklären. In beiden Fällen spielen die internen sozialen und politischen Kräfteverhältnisse, die Gestalt des Staates, die Struktur der Klassen und die Art und Weise, wie ihre Beziehungen reguliert werden, eine entscheidende Rolle. Die Entwicklung des globalen Kapitalismus ist daher notwendig un-gleichmäßig und wird von erheblichen internationalen Ungleichheits- und Abhängigkeitsverhältnissen geprägt. Diese entstehen nicht zufällig, sondern werden durch die einzelstaatlichen Akkumulations- und Regulati-onszusammenhänge mit ihren jeweiligen Weltmarktverflechtungen produziert. Diese Unterschiede sind gleichzeitig eine grundlegende Voraussetzung der Kapitalverwertung im Weltmaßstab, von Ausbeutung und Klassenspaltung. Der globale Akkumulationsprozess hat die Existenz unterschiedlicher und ungleicher nationaler Akkumulations- und Regulationsweisen zur Voraussetzung und stützt sich auf die Möglichkeit, diese zu kombinieren oder gegeneinander auszuspielen. Seine Dynamik führt deshalb dazu, dass diese Ungleichheiten - beeinflusst durch politische Prozesse auf nationaler wie internationaler Ebene - immer wieder neu hergestellt werden. Abhängigkeit, »Unterentwicklung« und Peripherisie- rung sind somit keine vorübergehenden Fehlentwicklungen, sondern ein Strukturmerkmal des globalen Kapitalismus, ohne allerdings in ihrer konkreten Ausprägung ein für alle mal festgeschrieben zu sein (Beaud 1987, 17ff.). Im historischen Verlauf sind solche Länder international beherrschend geworden, die politisch-sozial einen starken, geschlossenen und relativ eigenständigen Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhang entwik- keln und dergestalt international verzahnen konnten, dass ein selbsttragendes, stetiges und starkes wirtschaftliches Wachstum möglich wurde. Internationale ökonomische Dominanz ist dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass es gelingt, im nationalen Rahmen einen Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhang zu entwickeln, der international derart verflochten ist, dass das betreffende Land für eine gewisse Zeit zum Direktionszentrum internationaler Waren-, Geld- und Kapitalströme werden kann und in der Lage ist, technologische Vorsprünge und die Verfügung über die Schlüsselproduktionen der jeweiligen Epoche zu behaupten (ebd., 17ff.). Dadurch werden diese Länder in die Lage versetzt, Produktions-, Ar- beits-, Technologie- und Konsumnormen weltweit zu bestimmen und damit die wirtschaftlichen Ressourcen anderer Länder zur Grundlage ihrer eigenen Expansion zu machen (vgl. dazu die Analyse der USA durch Aglietta 1976). Maßgebend für internationale Dominanz sind somit kei-neswegs allein militärische Stärke, die Größe der Bevölkerung oder der Reichtum an natürlichen Ressourcen. Eine gewisse Größe des Binnenmarkts ist zwar eine ebenso wichtige Voraussetzung für eine international beherrschende Stellung wie ein ausreichendes militärisches Potenzial. Letztlich entscheidend sind aber die inneren politischen Verhältnisse, die sozialen Kräftekonstellationen und die Art ihrer Institutionalisierung, die die Grundlage eines stabilen Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhangs bilden. Dem Staat als Zentrum der Regulation, mittels dessen Kräfteverhältnisse stabilisiert, soziale Kompromisse institutionalisiert und gesellschaftliche Konflikte reguliert werden, kommt dabei eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Beispielsweise verhindert die Existenz einer starken Agraroligarchie, die im Gegensatz zur industriekapitalistischen Bourgeoisie steht, in der Regel die Herausbildung einer kohärenten Regulationsweise. Deshalb hat sich die Durchsetzung von Landreformen vielfach als entscheidende Voraussetzung einer erfolgreichen kapitalistischen Entwicklung erwiesen, wie sich bei einem Vergleich südostasiatischer und lateinamerikanischer Länder zeigen lässt. Auf der anderen Seite erscheinen diktatorische Regime zwar auf den ersten Blick als besonders stark, können sich aber schließlich als Hemmschuh einer kapitalistischen Entwicklung erweisen, wenn sie die Herausbildung der sozialen Strukturen und Institutionen verhindern, die eine friedliche Regulierung von Klassenkonflikten und das flexible Zustandekommen sozialer Kompromisse ermöglichen. Internationale Dominanz ist also, insoweit sie auf einer besonderen ökonomischen Entwicklungsdynamik im Weltmarktzusammenhang beruht, ein höchst komplexes Phänomen. So ist es durchaus möglich, dass gerade die im Rahmen eines etablierten militärisch-industriellen Komplexes ausufernden Rüstungskosten die ökonomische Stellung eines international dominierenden Staates untergraben, wie an der Entwicklung der USA zu zeigen versucht wurde (Kennedy 1989). Auf der anderen Seite kann der Reichtum an natürlichen Ressourcen und die Konzentration auf deren Ausbeutung im Rahmen der »internationalen Arbeitsteilung« zu einer abhängigen Form der Weltmarktintegration führen und es schwierig machen, einen eigenständigen und kohärenten nationalen Akkumu- lations- und Regulationszusammenhang zu entwickeln.”翻译为中文","completion":"因此，在国际层面上，可以考虑双重联系：个别国家发展模式所标志的积累方式和调节方式之间的联系，取决于它们如何融入国际分工，而后者反过来又受到国家形态的结构和发展的影响。全球资本主义因此可以被理解为多个层面上、涉及不同且相互对立的行为者（如企业、政府、行政机关、非政府组织、国际组织等）的复杂联系过程（Lipietz 1987, 25）。在这个全球体系内，本质上存在着国家自身发展的空间，尽管程度不同（Mistral 1986,172ff.）。对于个别国家，“存在一系列可能的位置，换言之，一系列相互对应的国家制度，但这些位置并非预先设定。不同国家的统治阶级可以参考一整套‘模型’”（Lipietz 1987,24。译者翻译）。统治阶级所采取的策略取决于其在全球竞争关系中的位置，以及内部政治社会力量关系和与被统治阶级打交道的条件。从中得出的重要结论是，单个国家在国际体系中的地位——支配或依赖的程度——取决于这些内部关系、社会冲突和妥协结构及其制度化的形式。因此，“国家”资本主义阶级的组成对经济发展可能性至关重要。例如，工业资本还是金融资本占主导地位，主导资本是面向国内市场还是出口导向的，或者是否存在强大的竞争阶级如农业大地主（参见Senghaas 1982中丹麦和乌拉圭发展的有趣对比）。此外，资本的国际联系程度以及劳动力的发展程度怎样，是否有足够的组织和政治力量能够从资本那里争取到物质让步，也很关键。 与经典的帝国主义、世界体系或依赖理论不同，调节方法论并不将全球资本主义体系视为由一个中心控制并在其结构上时空固定的支配和从属、中心与边缘关系，而是视为易变的、对立且同时相互联系的单个国家、可能的区域性积累和调节联系的网络。全球积累过程由竞争的单个国家形态及其特定的积累和调节方式支持，并决定了其具体轨迹。同时，这些在其内部结构上又依赖于全球经济进程和它们融入世界市场联系的可能性。 考虑到单个国家在国际体系中的位置取决于它们如何政治和制度地塑造其调节方式，如何确立阶级关系，并如何构建国家和政治体系的具体结构，就可能解释曾经占主导地位的大都市（如大不列颠）的衰落以及某些成功的“追赶性发展”现象（如某些东亚“四小龙”国家）。在这两种情况中，内部社会和政治力量关系、国家的结构、阶级的结构，以及如何调节它们之间的关系，都发挥了决定性作用。 因此，全球资本主义的发展必然是不平衡的，并受到显著的国际不平等和依赖关系的影响。这些关系不是偶然产生的，而是由单个国家的积累和调节联系及其与世界市场的联系产生的。这些差异同时是全球范围内资本增值、剥削和阶级分裂的基本前提条件。全球积累过程依赖于不同和不平等的国家积累和调节方式的存在，并依赖于结合或相互对立它们的能力。因此，其动力导致这些不平等受到国家和国际层面政治进程的影响而不断重新产生。依赖、\\"不发达\\"和边缘化因此不是临时性的发展失调，而是全球资本主义的一个结构特征，尽管它们的具体表现不是一成不变的（Beaud 1987, 17ff.）。 在历史的进程中，那些政治社会上形成强大、紧密且相对独立的积累和调节联系，并能够以此国际化以促成自我驱动、稳定且强劲的经济增长的国家逐渐在国际上占据主导地位。国际经济支配的特征在于，成功在国内框架内发展积累和调节联系，这些联系在国际上如此交织，以至该国在一定时期内能成为国际商品、货币和资本流动的指挥中心，并能够保持在各个时代关键生产领域的技术领先和掌控权（同上，17ff.）。因此，赋予国家国际主导地位的，并非仅是军事力量、人口规模或自然资源的丰富。一个足够大的内部市场和足够的军事潜力确实是国际主导地位的重要前提，但最终决定性的是内部的政治关系、社会力量配置和其制度化方式，这些构成稳定积累和调节联系的基础。国家作为调节的中心，通过它来稳定力量关系、制度化社会妥协和调节社会冲突，在此过程中占据特殊重要性。例如，强大的对立于工业资本主义资产阶级的农业寡头阶级的存在，通常会阻碍一种连贯的调节方式的形成。因此，土地改革的实施往往被证明是成功资本主义发展的决定性前提，如东南亚和拉丁美洲国家比较中所示。另一方面，独裁政权虽然乍看之下似乎特别强大，但如果它们阻碍了和平调节阶级冲突、灵活达成社会妥协所需的社会结构和机构的形成，最终可能成为资本主义发展的障碍。因此，国际主导地位，因其依赖于世界市场联系中特有的经济发展动力，是一种极其复杂的现象。因此，正如尝试用美国的发展来说明的，围绕一个建立的军工复合体不断增长的军费开支，可能会削弱国际主导国家的经济地位（Kennedy 1989）。另一方面，自然资源丰富和在“国际分工”框架内专注于开发这些资源，可能导致一种依赖性的世界市场融入形式，并使开发独立而连贯的国家积累和调节联系变得困难。"},{"prompt":"请将“Abhängigkeit lässt sich somit in ähnlicher Weise erklären wie Dominanz.

Diese organisieren ihr Wachstum in einem globalen Zusammenhang von Produktion und Zirkulation, dem die abhängigen Ökonomien untergeordnet werden (Beaud 1987, 47; Alnasseri 2004a). Die international beherrschende Stellung eines nationalen Wachstumsmodells erzeugt nicht nur ökonomische, sondern auch politische und kulturelle Abhängigkeiten (Cox 1993). Auf der anderen Seite werden untergeordnete Länder durch eine dominante Gesellschaft und Ökonomie einem Anpassungsdruck ausgesetzt, der zu einer globalen historischen Formation, d.h. einer gewissen Verallgemeinerung der dominanten Akkumulations- und Regulationsmuster führen kann. Die einfache Kopie eines beherrschenden Akkumulationsund Regulationsmodells ist aber angesichts unterschiedlicher ökonomischer Ausgangslagen, politisch-sozialer Systeme und Kräfteverhältnisse kaum möglich. Übergreifende kapitalistische Formationen, die über gewisse gemeinsame Grundzüge in den Akkumulations- und Regulationsweisen verfügen, bleiben immer von erheblichen nationalen Unterschieden und voneinander abweichenden Entwicklungsmodellen gekennzeichnet. Der Fordismus, der sich unter der Vorherrschaft der USA nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg als global beherrschende Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise herausgebildet hat, war zwar von einigen gemeinsamen Strukturmerkmalen und Entwicklungstendenzen - z.B. tayloristische Arbeitsorganisation, Massenproduktion und Massenkonsum, gewisse sozialstaatliche Entwicklungen - geprägt, enthielt jedoch immer erhebliche nationale Unterschiede, so zwischen den nordwesteuropäischen Ländern und den USA, ganz zu schweigen von den Staaten der »Dritten Welt«, in denen die fordistischen Strukturen - wenn überhaupt - höchst unvollkommen ausgeprägt waren. Die konkrete Gestalt internationaler Abhängig- keits- und Konkurrenzverhältnisse hängt stark vom global herrschenden Akkumulations- und Regulationsmodus ab und verändert sich mit diesem. Ein Beispiel dafür ist der Übergang vom klassischen Kolonialismus zu einem informellen Imperialismus, der sich im Zuge der Durchsetzung des von den USA beherrschten fordistischen Kapitalismus nach dem zweiten Weltkrieg entwickelt hatte (vgl. Kap. 3). Er beruht darauf, politisch formell selbstständige und über eigene Staatsapparate verfügende Länder dem dominierenden Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhang ein- und unterzuordnen. Da das globale kapitalistische System durch verschiedene und sich un-terschiedlich entwickelnde ökonomisch-soziale Räume sowie durch die Existenz konkurrierender Staaten geprägt ist, kann sich auf der internationalen Ebene ein kohärentes Regulationssystem - ähnlich wie es im einzelstaatlichem Rahmen in der Regel vorhanden ist - nur schwer bilden. Dennoch bedarf der Akkumulationsprozess im Weltmaßstab eigener, zwischen-, neben- und überstaatlicher regulativer Mechanismen zur Gewährleistung eines einigermaßen stabilen internationalen Waren-, Arbeitskraft-, Geld und Kapitalverkehrs. Auch im globalen Maßstab muss daher der Akkumulationsprozess politisch-institutionell reguliert werden, was aber angesichts der einzelstaatlichen politischen Verfasstheit des Kapitalismus auf besondere Schwierigkeiten stößt. Das internationale Regulationssystem besteht deshalb sehr viel stärker als die nationalen aus einer Vielzahl höchst unterschiedlicher und nur sehr locker miteinander verbundener Institutionen, Organisationen und Gruppierungen: Regierungen und Zentralbanken, internationale Institutionen wie etwa der Internationale Währungsfonds, die Welthandelsorganisation (WTO) oder die Weltbank, mehr oder weniger lockere Staatenzusammenschlüsse wie OPEC, OECD, G7 oder G10, internationale Unternehmungen und Verbände, Gewerkschaften, Parteien usw. Weil die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse indessen grundsätzlich an den nationalstaatlichen Rahmen gebunden bleibt und zugleich die Widersprüche und Dynamiken des globalen Akkumulationsprozesses permanent zu unterschiedlichen ökonomisch-sozialen Entwicklungen und zwischenstaatlichen Konflikten führt, kann ein internationales Regulationssystem nur eine stark beschränkte Einheitlichkeit und Dichte entwickeln. Es muss noch sehr viel mehr als auf nationalstaatlicher Ebene fragmentiert und unvollständig bleiben (Ro- bles 1994, 253ff.). Die Bestandsfähigkeit nationaler Akkumulations- und Regulationsweisen ist somit an die Existenz eines internationalen Regulationszusammenhangs gebunden, der von ihrer eigenen Dynamik immer wieder unterminiert wird. Dessen konkrete Gestalt - also etwa die für den internationalen Nachkriegs-Fordismus zentralen Institutionen des Bretton-Woods-Systems, der Internationale Währungsfonds und die Weltbank - hängt von der international dominant durchgesetzten Akku- mulations- und Regulationsweise ab und verändert sich mit dieser. Diese, das Verhältnis von nationaler und internationaler Regulation bestimmenden Widersprüche bewirken, dass internationale Regulations-zusammenhänge bisher nur dann auf längere Dauer stabil blieben, wenn sie von einer Vormacht garantiert wurden, wie etwa von Großbritannien unter der Herrschaft des internationalen Goldstandards bis zum Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts oder von den USA mit dem Dollar als »Weltgeld« in der Periode des Fordismus. Hegemonial wird ein solches Verhältnis dann, wenn das beherrschende Land nicht nur sein Akkumulations- und Regulationsmodell als international bestimmend durchsetzen und damit den globalen Akkumulations- und Regulationsmodus prägen kann, sondern darüber hinaus bereit und in der Lage ist, diesen mit seinen materiellen Möglichkeiten und institutionellen Mitteln zu stützen. Dies unterscheidet eine bloße Machtstellung von einer hegemonialen Position. Deren Aufrechterhaltung schließt immer die Notwendigkeit ein, auf kurzfristige Vorteile zugunsten der längerfristigen Stabilität der bestehenden internationalen Regulationsweise und der damit verbundenen Weltmarktbeziehungen zu verzichten. Die Anwendung einfacher militärischer und ökonomischer Macht reicht grundsätzlich nicht aus. Internationale Hegemonie bleibt an die Möglichkeit staatenübergreifender Ausgleichs- und Kompromissverhältnisse gebunden, die im Prinzip auch den untergeordneten und abhängigen Ländern eine Wachstums- und Entwicklungschance einräumen (Mistral 1986, 180). Dass die Erringung einer derartigen hegemonialen Position nicht willkürlich erfolgen kann, sondern auf internationalen politisch-sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen beruht, wird an der Stellung der Vereinigten Staaten in der Mitte des vorigen Jahrhunderts deutlich. Diese resultierte in entscheidendem Maß aus dem Konflikt mit der Sowjetunion. Er zwang die herrschenden Klassen Westeuropas undJa- pans, sich unter den militärischen Schutz der westlichen Vormacht zu stellen und gleichzeitig war diese unter dem Diktat der Systemkonkurrenz zu einer Politik gezwungen, die auf eine gleichmäßige und sozial integrative Entwicklung ihrer Einflusssphäre gerichtet war. Kapitalistische Formationskrisen: Ursachen und Wirkungen Die kapitalistische Gesellschaft ist aufgrund ihrer strukturellen Antagonismen und Konflikte grundsätzlich krisenhaft und kann deshalb in ihren jeweiligen sozialen, politischen und institutionellen Strukturen auch nur für beschränkte Zeiträume stabil sein. Ihre Entwicklung verläuft nicht linear und kontinuierlich, sondern Phasen relativer Stabilität werden immer wieder durch große Krisen unterbrochen. Die Frage ist, wie es dazu kommt, dass eine einmal durchgesetzte und hegemonial stabilisierte Ak- kumulations- und Regulationsweise zusammenbricht.”翻译为中文","completion":"因此，依赖性可以以与支配相似的方式来解释。它基于由于现有的阶级力量关系，未能形成一种连贯且相对自主的积累和调节方式。经济和社会过程因而受到主导经济体设定的条件——生产技术、积累方式、消费模式、资源需求等的特别强烈影响。这些条件为支配经济体在全球生产和流通背景下组织自身的增长，而将依赖经济体置于从属地位 (Beaud 1987, 47; Alnasseri 2004a)。国际主导地位的国家发展模式不仅产生经济依赖性，还产生政治和文化依赖性 (Cox 1993)。 另一方面，受主导地位的社会和经济施加的调整压力，较低级别的国家可能导致全球历史形态的形成，即主导积累和调节模式的某种普遍化。虽然由于不同的经济起点、政治社会体制和力量关系，复制一个主导的积累和调节模型几乎是不可能的。涵盖一些共同基本特征的积累和调节方式的跨越资本主义形态始终表现出显著的国家差异和不同的发展模型。以美国为主导的福特主义在二战后作为全球主导的积累和调节方式形成，尽管它展现了一些共同的结构特征和发展趋势——例如泰勒式劳动组织、大规模生产和大规模消费、某些社会福利发展——但它始终包含了显著的国家差异，例如北西欧国家和美国之间的差异，更不用说“第三世界”国家，福特主义结构在那里（如果有的话）是极不完整的。国际依赖和竞争关系的具体形式很大程度上依赖于全球主导的积累和调节模式，并随之变化。一个例子是由经典殖民主义向二战后美国主导的福特主义资本主义形成的非正式帝国主义的过渡。 由于全球资本主义系统是由不同和不同发展的经济社会空间以及存在竞争的国家构成的，一个和单个国家框架内通常存在的类似的连贯的调节系统在国际层面上只能很难形成。然而，世界范围内的积累过程仍然需要跨国、多边和超国家的调节机制，以确保国际商品、劳动力、货币和资本流动的相对稳定。因此，全球范围内的积累过程必须在政治制度层面上进行调节，但由于资本主义的国家政治构造，这在特别的困难中进行。因此，国际调节系统比国家调节系统更多由一系列高度多样化且只是非常松散相连的机构、组织和团体组成：政府和中央银行、国际机构如国际货币基金组织、世界贸易组织（WTO）或世界银行、各种松散的国家联盟如OPEC、OECD、G7或G10、国际企业和协会、工会、政党等。由于调节阶级关系根本上与国家框架绑定，同时全球积累过程的矛盾和动态不断导致不同的经济社会发展和国家间的冲突，国际调节系统只能形成有限的一致性和密度。它必须比国家层面上更为破碎和不完整 (Robles 1994, 253ff.)。国家积累和调节方式的生存能力因此依赖于自身动态不断破坏的国际调节联系的存在。它的具体形式——例如国际战后福特主义中心的布雷顿森林体系、国际货币基金组织和世界银行——取决于国际上主导强制通过的积累和调节方式，并随之变化。 这些决定国家与国际调节关系的矛盾导致，国际调节联系在过去只有在有强国保障时才能长期稳定，例如由大不列颠在国际黄金标准统治下一直到20世纪初或由美国在福特主义时期以美元作为“世界货币”。当主导国不仅能够将其积累和调节模型作为国际决定性因素强制通过，从而塑造全球积累和调节模式，而且愿意且有能力以其物质资源和制度手段支持它时，这种关系则成为霸权性的。这区分了简单的权力地位和霸权地位。其维持始终需要牺牲短期利益以保证现有国际调节方式和相关的世界市场关系的长期稳定性。单纯运用军事和经济权力通常是不够的。国际霸权依赖于跨国的平衡和妥协关系的可能性，这在原则上也为下级和依赖国家提供增长和发展的机会（Mistral 1986, 180）。美国在上世纪中叶的地位显著说明了，获得如此霸权地位并非随意行事，而是基于国际政治社会力量关系，这在很大程度上是由与苏联的冲突引起的。这迫使西欧和日本的统治阶级接受西方主导国的军事保护，同时这种体系竞争也迫使它采取政策，旨在促进其影响范围的均衡和社会整合发展。 资本主义形态危机：原因和影响 由于其结构性的对立和冲突，资本主义社会本质上是危机性的，因此其在各自的社会、政治和制度结构中也只能稳定有限的时期。其发展不是线性和连续的，而是相对稳定的阶段不断被大危机打断。问题在于，一旦建立并稳定的积累和调节方式为何会崩溃。"},{"prompt":"请将“Die Antwort ist, allgemein formuliert, dass sowohl Akkumulationsregime als auch die mit ihnen verbundenen Regulationsweisen jeweils eigene Strukturen und Entwicklungsdynamiken aufweisen. Dies führt mit einer gewissen Notwendigkeit dazu, dass ihre einmal hergestellte, eine spezifische historische Gesellschaftsformation kennzeichnende Verbindung nicht dauerhaft sein kann, sondern früher oder später zerbrechen muss. Etwas vereinfacht ausgedrückt, kann man davon ausgehen, dass der vom Zwang zur Profitmaximierung angetriebene und im Rahmen eines gegebenen Akkumulationsregimes voranschreitende Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals eine fortwährende Veränderung der Kapitalzusammensetzung, der Branchenbeziehungen, der Produktionstechnologien, der Arbeits- und Klassenstrukturen sowie der gesellschaftlichen Naturverhältnisse bewirkt. Dies muss schließlich zu einem Zusammenstoß mit dem vorhandenen System der Regulation führen. Regulationsweisen zeigen als institutionalisierte Formen von Klassenbeziehungen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen, die durch bestimmte Ausschlussmechanismen, Be- teiligungs- und Zugangsrechte sowie spezifische gesellschaftliche Wertorientierungen geprägt sind, eine gewisse institutionelle und normative Starrheit, die der Trägheit der Organisationen, der Beständigkeit von Routinen und Handlungsorientierungen sowie der Wirksamkeit organisatorisch verfestigter Interessen geschuldet ist. Das heißt, dass die jeweils bestehende Form der Institutionalisierung von Klassenbeziehungen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen nicht unbeschränkt flexibel und anpassungsfähig sein kann. Dies muss früher oder später dazu führen, dass die Profitabilität des Kapitals im Rahmen der bestehenden Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise abnimmt, das kapitalistische Wachstum ins Stocken gerät und damit eine Krise der ganzen gesellschaftlichen Formation entsteht. So erklärt sich, weshalb die »Selbstrevolutionierung« der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft, die sich in der historischen Umwälzung der Produktionsbedingungen, der Technologien und der gesellschaftlich-politischen Verhältnisse äußert, nicht kontinuierlich, sondern eben in der Form »säkularer« Krisen und Brüche voranschreitet. Die kapitalistische Akkumulationsdynamik und die in ihr enthaltenen gesellschaftlichen Widersprüche und Konflikte begründen demnach die Krisenhaftigkeit der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft. Aber die Form des Ausbrechens, die Erscheinungsweise und der Verlauf von Krisen hängen immer vom Charakter der vorhandenen Akkumulationsregime und Regulationsweisen ab. Dies bedeutet, dass die großen kapitalistischen Krisen nicht einfach nur »ökonomisch« sind. Ebenso unbefriedigend bleiben die in verschiedenen Varianten der »Theorie der langen Wellen« vorgetragenen Erklärungen, die diese mit periodischen technologischen Schüben in Zusammenhang bringen, sofern sie die gesellschaftlichen Regula-tionsbedingungen außer acht lassen (vgl. z.B. Mandel 1983). Auch das »Gesetz vom tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate«, das den Kern der Marx- schen Krisenerklärung darstellt, erlaubt keine Aussage über konkrete Krisenursachen und -Verläufe, solange nichts über die Wirksamkeit von »Gegentendenzen« gesagt werden kann, die immer durch politisch-soziale Kräfteverhältnisse und Institutionalisierungsformen bestimmt sind (vgl. dazu ausführlicher Hirsch 1974, 29ff.). Diese, beispielsweise die Entwicklung des realen Lebenshaltungsniveaus der Lohnabhängigen, staatlich vermittelte Kapitalentwertung, die Außenhandelsbeziehungen oder die Entwicklung der Produktionstechnologie hängen ganz entscheidend von der Art und Weise der Regulation ab. Ungeachtet der umwälzenden Dynamik des Akkumulationsprozesses wäre eine relativ störungsfreie Entwicklung des Kapitalismus unter der Bedingung denkbar, dass sie von kontinuierlichen Veränderungen der institutionellen Konfigurationen und Klassenverhältnisse - etwa der Betriebs- und Produktionsorganisation, der gewerkschaftlichen Organisationsformen, der sozialstaatlichen Strukturen und der Konsumgewohnheiten - begleitet wäre. Dies könnte die flexible Durchsetzung sowohl neuer Technologien als auch veränderter materieller Lebensverhältnisse ermöglichen und auf diese Weise die Stabilität der Profitrate ungeachtet der von Marx diagnostizierten Veränderung in der Wertzusammensetzung des Kapitals - dem Verhältnis von vergegenständlichter und lebendiger Arbeit - gewährleisten. Konkreter: Einem Sinken des Kapitalprofits könnte etwa durch fortwährende Reallohnsenkungen, Sozialabbau oder die kontinuierliche Durchsetzung produktionstechnischer Rationalisierungen begegnet werden, die die Arbeitsproduktivität vergrößern. Im Rahmen einer einmal durchgesetzten Regulationsweise mit ihren institutionell verfestigten Kräfteverhältnissen, Interessenkompromissen, Konsumstandards und Lebensweisen ist das jedoch nicht ohne weiteres und nicht ohne größere gesellschaftliche und politische Kämpfe möglich. Die allgemeine Feststellung, dass der Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals immer Klassenkampf ist, kann somit derart konkretisiert werden, dass diese Auseinandersetzungen eben nicht nur auf dem Feld der Löhne und Arbeitsbedingungen, sondern auch im gesamten politischen Raum stattfinden: Es gibt keinen Politikbereich, der nicht in irgendeiner Weise auf den Akkumulationsprozess des Kapitals bezogen wäre. Das regulative System, das den Akkumulations- und Verwertungsprozess des Kapitals trotz der ihm zugrunde liegenden Antagonismen und Widersprüche überhaupt erst möglich macht, erweist sich somit zugleich als Auslöser - wenn auch nicht als Verursacher - seiner Krisen. Aus regulationstheoretischer Sicht lässt sich damit sowohl die Notwendigkeit des periodischen Auftretens als auch der allgemeine Verursachungszusammenhang der großen kapitalistischen Krisen erklären. Allerdings folgen ihre Entstehung, ihre konkreten Erscheinungsformen und Verläufe keiner allgemeinen Gesetzmäßigkeit, sondern sind von der jeweils bestehenden Akkumulat- ions- und Regulationsweise abhängig. Jede historische Formation des Kapitalismus hat ihre eigene Krise. Die »säkularen« Krisen des Kapitalismus sind also immer als Einheit von ökonomischen, sozialen und politisch-hegemonialen Entwicklungen zu verstehen, als Auswirkung eines komplexen Akkumulations- und Re-gulationszusammenhangs, der von den grundlegenden gesellschaftlichen Widersprüchen bestimmt wird. Krisen der Regulation sind zugleich immer auch Krisen der Hegemonie, in denen die bestehenden sozialen Kompromisse, die Integrations- und Ausschlussmechanismen, die gesellschaftlichen Wertorientierungen und Ordnungsvorstellungen zur Disposition stehen. Die Kapitalakkumulation stockt, wenn ihre Dynamik mit dem bestehenden Regulationssystem in Kollision gerät und dadurch der Verwertungsprozess in Frage gestellt wird. Die dadurch ausgelöste Krise untergräbt die bestehenden gesellschaftlichen Ubereinkünfte. Mit dem Zerbröseln des »ideologischen Kitts«, der die staatliche Apparatur und die »zivile Gesellschaft« zusammenhält, zerfällt auch die Einheit und Funktionsfähigkeit des regulativen Systems: Einzelne Teile verselbständigen sich, die Konflikte zwischen den Institutionen nehmen zu, die politische Führung, erscheint desorientiert und »Regierungsfähigkeit« wird insgesamt problematisch (Jessop 1985, 90ff.). Einheit von ökonomischer, politischer und ideologischer Krise bedeutet auch, dass es keine von vornherein feststehende Ebene der Krisenentstehung gibt. Aus der Dynamik des Akkumulationsprozesses allein lässt sich das Entstehen großer Krisen nicht zureichend erklären, auch wenn dieser bei der Entstehung und Entwicklung von Krisen eine grundlegende Bedeutung zukommt. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es Prozesse im regulativen System etwa die Eigendynamik sozialstaatlicher Regelungen, ideologische Auseinandersetzungen oder Formen der Parteikonkurrenz, die, wenn nicht krisenverursachend, so doch krisenauslösend und -verschärfend wirken können. In den großen Krisen und den damit verbundenen ökonomischen, po-litischen und ideologischen Auseinandersetzungen verschieben sich die gesellschaftlichen Kräfteverhältnisse, werden soziale Kompromisse auf-gekündigt und zerbricht das vorhandene institutionelle Gefüge der Regulation. Auf diesem veränderten gesellschaftlichen und politischen Feld entwickeln sich die Kämpfe um die Neuordnung der Gesellschaft. Ob und in welcher Weise aus der Krise einer kapitalistischen Formation eine neue, wieder relativ bestandsfähige hervorgeht, bleibt dabei grundsätzlich offen. Zu welchem Ergebnis veränderte Kräftekonstellationen und Kämpfe führen, lässt sich nicht vorhersagen. Sowohl der Zusammenbruch der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft als auch die Herausbildung einer neuen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise - von revolutionären Entwicklungen einmal abgesehen - sind grundsätzlich möglich.”翻译为中文","completion":"一般来说，回答是积累体制和它们相关的调节方式各自具有自己的结构和发展动态。这必然导致它们一旦形成的特定历史社会形态标志性的联系不能永久存在，而是迟早会破裂。简单来说，由于追求利润最大化的冲动和在一个给定的积累体制框架内推进的资本积累过程，会持续改变资本组成、行业关系、生产技术、劳动和阶级结构以及社会自然关系。这最终必然会与现存的调节系统发生冲突。作为阶级关系和社会力量关系的制度化形式，调节方式展示出某种机构和规范的僵固性，这是由组织的惯性、惯例和行为取向的持续性以及组织化利益的有效性所导致的。这意味着当前的阶级关系和社会力量关系的制度化形式不可能是无限灵活和适应性的。这必然导致现存的积累和调节方式下的资本盈利能力最终降低，资本主义增长停滞，从而导致整个社会形态进入危机。因此解释了资本主义社会的\\"自我革命\\"，它表现在生产条件、技术和社会政治关系的历史性变革中，而不是以\\"世纪性\\"危机和断裂的形式持续发展。 资本积累动态及其内含的社会矛盾和冲突因而构成了资本主义社会的危机性本质。但是，危机的爆发形式、表现和过程总是依赖于现存的积累体制和调节方式的特征。这意味着大型资本主义危机不仅仅是“经济性”的。同样不尽人意的是，在各种版本的“长波理论”中提出的解释，它们将这些危机与周期性的技术推动联系起来，如果忽略了社会调节条件（参见例如Mandel 1983）。即使是马克思的“利润率趋势性下降法则”，这是马克思危机理论的核心，也无法解释具体的危机原因和过程，除非能够确定“逆向趋势”的有效性，这总是由政治社会力量关系和制度化形式决定的（进一步参见Hirsch 1974, 29ff.）。这些，例如雇佣劳动者真实生活水平的发展、国家介入的资本贬值、外贸关系或生产技术的发展，极大地取决于调节方式。尽管积累过程的剧变动态，如果伴随着机构配置和阶级关系的持续变化 - 例如企业和生产组织、工会组织形式、社会国家结构和消费习惯的变化 - 则资本主义的相对平稳发展在条件上是可想象的。这可以使新技术的灵活实施以及物质生活条件的变化成为可能，从而保证了尽管存在马克思诊断的资本价值组成的变化 - 实物劳动和活劳动之间的比率 - 利润率的稳定性。具体来说：例如，通过持续降低实际工资、削减社会福利或持续推进生产技术合理化来提高劳动生产率，可以对抗资本利润的下降。然而，在一旦实施的调节方式以及其机构化的力量关系、利益妥协、消费标准和生活方式框架内，这并不是轻而易举且不引发较大的社会和政治斗争就能实现的。 将资本积累过程总是作为阶级斗争的一般表述因此可以具体化为，这些斗争不仅在工资和劳动条件领域进行，而且在整个政治领域都在进行：没有任何政治领域不以某种方式与资本的积累过程相关联。能够使资本积累和增值过程尽管其潜在的对立和矛盾成为可能的调节系统，因而同时也成为——虽然不是原因——其危机的触发器。从调节理论的角度看，这既解释了周期性危机发生的必然性，也解释了大型资本主义危机的一般成因。然而，它们的起源、具体表现形式和过程不遵循任何普遍的规律，而是依赖于特定的积累和调节方式。每种资本主义的历史形态都有其自身的危机。 资本主义的“世纪性”危机因此总是作为经济、社会和政治霸权性发展的统一体来理解，作为一个由基本社会矛盾决定的复杂积累和调节联系的效果。调节危机同时也总是霸权危机，在这些危机中，现存的社会妥协、整合和排斥机制、社会价值取向和秩序观念都面临重新评估。当其动态与现存的调节系统发生冲突，从而使增值过程受到质疑时，资本积累停滞。由此引发的危机削弱了现存社会协议。随着将国家机构和“民间社会”联系在一起的“意识形态粘合剂”的瓦解，调节系统的统一性和功能性也随之分崩离析：个别部分独立化，机构之间的冲突增加，政治领导显得迷失方向，整体的“治理能力”成为问题（Jessop 1985, 90ff.）。 经济、政治和意识形态危机的统一性也意味着，危机的发生层面不是预先确定的。单纯从积累过程的动态中无法充分解释大危机的发生，尽管这在危机的产生和发展中有着根本性的意义。另一方面，在调节系统中的进程——例如，社会国家规定的自发动力、意识形态争论或政党竞争形式——即使不是导致危机的原因，也可能是触发和加剧危机的因素。 在大危机和随之而来的经济、政治和意识形态斗争中，社会力量关系发生变化，社会妥协被撤销，现有的调节机构结构破裂。在这个变革的社会和政治领域上，围绕重新组织社会的斗争展开。资本主义形态的危机是否能转变为一种新的、再次相对稳定的形态，这是基本上开放的问题。改变后的力量结构和斗争将导致何种结果，是无法预测的。资本主义社会的崩溃以及新积累和调节方式的形成——撇开革命性变革不谈——都是根本上可能的。"},{"prompt":"请将“Allerdings muss davon ausgegangen werden, dass die ökonomischen, sozialen und politischen Verhältnisse der krisenhaft zusammenbrechenden alten einen wesentlichen Einfluss auf die Gestalt der sich herausbildenden neuen Formation haben und dass die sozialen Formbestimmungen des Kapitalismus ihre Wirksamkeit auch dann behalten, wenn das bestehende institutionelle System brüchig wird. Die Entstehung einer neuen kapitalistischen Formation geschieht in einem komplizierten Kampf- und Auseinandersetzungsprozess, an dem viele widerstreitende soziale Akteure beteiligt sind. Sie folgt daher keiner eindeutig vorformulierten »Strategie«, sondern bleibt daran gebunden, dass ihre Strukturen durch handelnde Individuen und Gruppen gestaltet und ideologisch konsolidiert werden, sich ein neues »hegemoniales Projekt« entwickelt. Das regulationstheoretische Konzept erlaubt es, zwischen »kleinen« Krisen innerhalb einer vorhandenen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise - konjunkturellen Schwankungen, institutionellen Reibungen und Konflikten - und den »großen« Krisen der Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise selbst zu unterscheiden. Gleichwohl bleibt über alle Krisen einzelner Formationen hinweg die kapitalistische Grundstruktur erhalten, sofern sie nicht revolutionär überwunden wird oder in einem allgemeinen Zusammenbruch endet. Krisen sind das Vehikel, mit dem sich der Kapitalismus trotz seiner Widersprüche im Zeitablauf erhält. Gerade für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft gilt, dass sich alles verändern muss, damit das Alte erhalten bleibt. Das bedeutet auch, dass über alle historischen Brüche hinweg die grundlegenden sozialen Strukturen und Dynamiken wirksam bleiben. Die für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft charakteristische Form des Politischen erhält sich gerade dadurch, dass die konkrete Organisation des Staates und des politischen Systems immer wieder umgewälzt wird, ebenso wie das kapitalistische Klassenverhältnis dadurch stabilisiert wird, dass sich seine konkrete Struktur, die Formen seiner Institutionalisierung und Regulation verändern. Kein sozialer Antagonismus, auch nicht die grundlegenden Natur- und Geschlechterverhältnisse, verschwindet mit der Krise und Neubildung der Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise. Auch sie werden nur in neuen Formen institutionalisiert und miteinander verbunden. Dieses komplizierte Verhältnis von Kontinuität und Bruch in der kapi-talistischen Entwicklung macht es unmöglich, Krisen und Übergänge zwischen den historischen Formationen dieser Gesellschaft allein an einzelnen ökonomischen Merkmalen wie z.B. Wachstumsraten oder bestimmten Formen der Produktionsorganisation festzumachen. Jede Ak- kumulations- und Regulationsweise besitzt gewisse Anpassungsspielräume und verändert sich dadurch im Zeitablauf. Ohne diese Flexibilität hätte sie selbst auf kurze Sicht keinen Bestand. Deshalb ist die Unterscheidung von Krisen in der Regulation und Krisen der Regulation praktisch gar nicht so einfach. Noch grundlegender gilt, dass Krisen zwar strukturelle, vom Handeln der Betroffenen relativ unabhängige Ursachen haben, aber erst dann Wirklichkeit werden, wenn sie in deren Bewusstsein als solche wahrgenommen werden. Noch schärfer ausgedrückt: große gesellschaftliche Krisen werden dann Realität, wenn die bestehenden Lebens- und Arbeitsweisen, Institutionen, sozialen Konsense, Leitbilder und Wertvorstellungen umfassend in Frage gestellt werden, ihre Legitimation und Gültigkeit verlieren. Dieser Vorgang ist es, der vorhandene Akkumulat- ions- und Regulationsweisen schließlich zum Zusammenbruch bringt und der die politischen und ideologischen Kämpfe, die institutionellen Reor- ganisations- und die ideologischen Reorientierungsprozesse vorantreibt. Erst dadurch verdichtet sich die Krise einer Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise zu einer Krise der sozialen Formation. Insofern, um noch einmal auf ein konkretes Beispiel zu verweisen, ist es müßig, die Frage nach dem Ende oder dem Weiterbestehen des fordistischen Nachkriegskapitalismus an objektiven Daten festzumachen. Entscheidend ist vielmehr das sich allgemein durchsetzende Bewusstsein, dass das bis dahin herrschende Gesellschaftsmodell ausgedient hat, seine Grundlagen entfallen sind und dass es keine Perspektive mehr zu bieten vermag. Diese Erkenntnis war am Ende der 1970erJahre kapitalistischen Unternehmern, radikalen Ökologen und linken Staatskritikern durchaus gemein. Damit wird auch die Bedeutung der »neuen sozialen Bewegungen« in der Krise des Fordismus deutlich. Gerade sie waren es, die nach der gelungenen Einbindung der Lohnabhängigen in den fordistischen Klassenkompromiss die ideologische, theoretische und praktische Kritik an diesem Ge-sellschaftsmodell und die Suche nach neuen Formen der Vergesellschaftung entschieden vorangetrieben haben (vgl. dazu Hirsch/Roth 1986, 168ff.; Roth 1994). Was sich im Gefolge der Fordismus-Krise gesellschaftlich entwickelt hat, mag mit ihren Vorstellungen nur wenig zu tun haben. In gewissem Sinne sind sie gegen ihren Willen zu Geburtshelfern des post- fordistischen Kapitalismus geworden und schließlich selbst den Krisen- und Umstrukturierungsprozessen zum Opfer gefallen, die sie mit vorangetrieben haben. Dies verweist noch einmal darauf, dass die gesellschaftlichen Prozesse im Kapitalismus kein steuerndes Zentrum haben, ihre Entwicklung das Produkt widersprüchlicher und gegenläufiger Handlungen ist und dass sich die Akteure und ihre Aktionsfelder mit den gesellschaftlichen Umbrüchen selbst grundlegend verändern (vgl. Esser u.a. 1994, 85ff.). 2. Vom Fordismus zum Postfordismus: Die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus seit dem Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts Die Regulationstheorie, die im vorangegangenen Kapitel in Grundzügen skizziert wurde, trägt einiges dazu bei, die aktuellen Strukturveränderungen des Kapitalismus zu verstehen. Dabei ist es zunächst einmal wichtig, die Entstehungsbedingungen und die Struktur des Fordismus zu erklären, dessen in den 1970er Jahren ausbrechende Krise den Ansatzpunkt für die als »Globalisierung« bezeichnete neoliberale Restrukturierung des globalen Kapitalismus bildet. Mit »Fordismus« wird die historische Gestalt des Kapitalismus bezeichnet, die seit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs bis in die 1970er Jahre hinein für die globalen gesellschaftlichen, ökonomischen und politischen Verhältnisse - nicht nur im kapitalistischen Teil der Welt - bestimmend war. An seinem Beginn stehen die Weltwirtschaftskrise der 1930er Jahre und die darauf folgenden gesellschaftlichen und politischen Umbrüche: Roosevelts »New Deal« in den USA, der europäische Faschismus, die Nazi-Herrschaft in Deutschland und schließlich der zweite Weltkrieg. Ein entscheidender Bedingungsfaktor für seine Entstehung ist die russische Oktoberrevolution, die Errichtung des »sozialistischen Lagers« und der damit verbundene Systemkonflikt zwischen Ost und West. Durch diese Ereignisse wurden die gesellschaftlichen Strukturen, die sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse und die politischen Systeme in weiten Teilen der Welt grundlegend verändert. Die Umwälzungen, die auf die Weltwirtschaftskrise der 1930er Jahre folgten, schufen die politischen und sozialen Bedingungen dafür, dass sich die neue, »fordistische« Formation des Kapitalismus in langen und oftmals blutigen Kämpfen durchsetzen konnte. Entstehungsbedingungen und Struktur des Fordismus Der Fordismus war mit der internationalen Vorherrschaft der USA verbunden, die aus den beiden Weltkriegen nicht nur als beherrschende Militärmacht hervorgegangen waren, sondern eine Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise entwickelten, die zu einem ökonomisch und technisch überlegenem und expansiven Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmodell führte. Nicht allein die militärische Überlegenheit, sondern viel mehr noch ihre ökonomische und gesellschaftliche Struktur begründete die interna-tional beherrschende Stellung der Vereinigten Staaten. Hegemonial wurde diese Position dadurch, dass sie nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs und angesichts des beginnenden Kalten Krieges mit der Sowjetunion bestrebt waren, zwecks Sicherung und Ausdehnung ihres militärischen und politischen Einflussbereichs den zusammengebrochenen Weltmarkt neu zu organisieren und der kapitalistischen Gesellschaftsordnung weltweit eine materielle Legitimation und eine Entwicklungsperspektive zu verleihen. Die Entstehung des Fordismus war also wesentlich der internationalen Kräftekonstellation nach der Oktoberrevolution geschuldet. Neben der militärischen und ökonomischen schloss dies die politische und kulturelle Dominanz der Vereinigten Staaten ein.

Vom Fordismus zum Postfordismus: Die Entwicklung des Kapitalismus seit dem Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts Die Regulationstheorie, die im vorangegangenen Kapitel in Grundzügen skizziert wurde, trägt einiges dazu bei, die aktuellen Strukturveränderungen des Kapitalismus zu verstehen. Dabei ist es zunächst einmal wichtig, die Entstehungsbedingungen und die Struktur des Fordismus zu erklären, dessen in den 1970er Jahren ausbrechende Krise den Ansatzpunkt für die als »Globalisierung« bezeichnete neoliberale Restrukturierung des globalen Kapitalismus bildet. Mit »Fordismus« wird die historische Gestalt des Kapitalismus bezeichnet, die seit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs bis in die 1970er Jahre hinein für die globalen gesellschaftlichen, ökonomischen und politischen Verhältnisse - nicht nur im kapitalistischen Teil der Welt - bestimmend war. An seinem Beginn stehen die Weltwirtschaftskrise der 1930er Jahre und die darauf folgenden gesellschaftlichen und politischen Umbrüche: Roosevelts »New Deal« in den USA, der europäische Faschismus, die Nazi-Herrschaft in Deutschland und schließlich der zweite Weltkrieg. Ein entscheidender Bedingungsfaktor für seine Entstehung ist die russische Oktoberrevolution, die Errichtung des »sozialistischen Lagers« und der damit verbundene Systemkonflikt zwischen Ost und West. Durch diese Ereignisse wurden die gesellschaftlichen Strukturen, die sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse und die politischen Systeme in weiten Teilen der Welt grundlegend verändert. Die Umwälzungen, die auf die Weltwirtschaftskrise der 1930er Jahre folgten, schufen die politischen und sozialen Bedingungen dafür, dass sich die neue, »fordistische« Formation des Kapitalismus in langen und oftmals blutigen Kämpfen durchsetzen konnte. Entstehungsbedingungen und Struktur des Fordismus Der Fordismus war mit der internationalen Vorherrschaft der USA verbunden, die aus den beiden Weltkriegen nicht nur als beherrschende Militärmacht hervorgegangen waren, sondern eine Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise entwickelten, die zu einem ökonomisch und technisch überlegenem und expansiven Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmodell führte. Nicht allein die militärische Überlegenheit, sondern viel mehr noch ihre ökonomische und gesellschaftliche Struktur begründete die interna-tional beherrschende Stellung der Vereinigten Staaten. Hegemonial wurde diese Position dadurch, dass sie nach dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs und angesichts des beginnenden Kalten Krieges mit der Sowjetunion bestrebt waren, zwecks Sicherung und Ausdehnung ihres militärischen und politischen Einflussbereichs den zusammengebrochenen Weltmarkt neu zu organisieren und der kapitalistischen Gesellschaftsordnung weltweit eine materielle Legitimation und eine Entwicklungsperspektive zu verleihen. Die Entstehung des Fordismus war also wesentlich der internationalen Kräftekonstellation nach der Oktoberrevolution geschuldet. Neben der militärischen und ökonomischen schloss dies die politische und kulturelle Dominanz der Vereinigten Staaten ein. Sie beherrschten die internationalen ökonomischen und politischen Organisationen und sie prägten die gesellschaftlichen Wertorientierungen, Lebensweisen und kulturellen Muster aus. Struktur- und entwicklungsbestimmend wurden nicht nur die Fließbänder der Detroiter Automobilindustrie und die High-TechWaffenschmieden Kaliforniens, sondern ebenso die Eigentümlichkeiten des amerikanischen way of life, präsentiert von den Filmfabriken Hollywoods. Auf diese Weise wurde das 20. tatsächlich zum »amerikanischen« Jahrhundert. Die Bezeichnung dieser historischen Periode des Kapitalismus als »for- distisch« geht auf die Einführung der tayloristischen Massenproduktion in Henry Fords I. Automobilwerken am Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts zurück. Damit wurden die Formen der Arbeitsorganisation, der gesamtwirtschaftliche Kreislauf, die Klassenstrukturen, Wertvorstellungen und Lebensweisen grundlegend umgewälzt. Das Automobil als Massenkonsumgut kann gewissermaßen als Schlüsselprodukt dieser Epoche gelten. Die Struktur des Fordismus weist trotz aller regionalen und nationalen Unterschiede einige Gemeinsamkeiten auf, die hier nur ganz allgemein und auf die wichtigsten Grundzüge beschränkt skizziert werden können (vgl. dazu ausführlicher Hirsch/Roth 1986 sowie Hirsch 1990). Grundlegend für den Fordismus ist die Durchsetzung der tayloristischen Arbeitsorganisation in der Massenproduktion standardisierter Konsumgüter. Die Zerlegung, zentrale Vorbereitung und Kontrolle der Arbeitsschritte diente der Verdrängung handwerklich qualifizierter Beschäftigter durch unqualifizierte Fließbandarbeiterinnen. Die gesellschaftliche Trennung von Hand- und Kopfarbeit wurde damit erheblich verändert und dies führte zu einer starken Rationalisierung und Arbeitsintensivierung. Die Arbeitsproduktivität stieg enorm an und dies wiederum begründete ein vergleichsweise starkes und beständiges ökonomisches Wachstum. Dadurch wurden beträchtliche Lohnsteigerungen möglich, die die Grundlage des sich entwickelnden Massenkonsums bildeten. Zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte des Kapitalismus wurde die Steigerung der Lohneinkommen und ein gewisser Massenwohlstand nicht nur mit der Rentabilität des Kapitals vereinbar, sondern bildeten sogar ihre Basis. Der »Traum immerwährender Prosperität« (Lutz 1984), von permanenten Einkommenssteigerungen und damit vom allmählichen Ausgleich der Klassenunterschiede schien Wirklichkeit zu werden. Der Konsum der Lohnabhängigen schuf neue Absatzmärkte und Kapitalanlagemöglichkeiten. In ökonomischen Begriffen ausgedrückt, wurde die Reproduktion der Arbeiterklasse, d.h. ihr immer mehr in Warenform stattfindender Konsum, zu einem zentralen Feld der Kapitalverwertung. Der Fordis- mus bedeutete insofern auch eine entscheidende Etappe bei der vollen historischen Durchsetzung des Kapitalismus. Jetzt erst wurde die Gesellschaft in ihren wesentlichen Bereichen dem Kapitalverhältnis unterworfen. Die Folge davon war ein Prozess der Durchkapitalisierung der Gesellschaft, der eine tiefgehende Umwälzung der sozialen Beziehungen und der Lebensverhältnisse nach sich zog. Hauswirtschaftliche, kleinbäuerliche und handwerkliche Produktionsweisen konnten der industrialisierten Massenproduktion immer weniger standhalten und verloren an Bedeutung. Das Kapital trat, wenn man so will, zu einer groß angelegten »inneren Landnahme« an (ebd.). Der ökonomische Prozess konzentrierte sich unter den Bedingungen des neuen Akkumulationsmodells auf die Erschließung des Binnenmarkts. Dies bedeutete, dass die gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse mehr und mehr kommerzialisiert, also geld- und tauschförmig organisiert wurden. Die formelle Lohnarbeit wurde ausgeweitet, traditionelle Reproduktionsformen durch industriell produzierte Waren und kommerzialisierte Dienste ersetzt. Erst jetzt wurde die kapitalistische Gesellschaft überwiegend zu einer Gesellschaft von Lohnabhängigen. Mit der Auflösung vorkapitalistischer Produktionsweisen veränderten sich auch die Familienstrukturen. In den kapitalistischen Metropolen wurde die auf Warenkonsum und Arbeitskraftreproduktion beschränkte Kleinfamilie zur allgemeinen und klassenübergreifend herrschenden Be- ziehungs- und Lebensform. Zugleich wurde die Klasse der Lohnabhängigen tiefgreifend umgeschichtet und neu zusammengesetzt. Durch die Entmachtung der noch handwerklich ausgebildeten und über eine umfassende Kenntnis der Produktionsabläufe verfügenden qualifizierten Arbeiterinnen konnte das Kapital die Arbeitsprozesse noch weitgehender seiner Kontrolle unterwerfen. Der Anteil der weniger qualifizierten Beschäftigten in der industriellen Produktion dehnte sich aus und der wachsende Arbeitskräftebedarf führte nicht nur zu einer zunehmenden Einbeziehung von Frauen in den industriellen Produktionsprozess, sondern war auch Grundlage großer Wanderungsbewegungen und einer starken Arbeitsemigration aus der industriellen Peripherie von sowohl innerhalb wie außerhalb der nationalen Grenzen. Durchkapitalisierung, Industrialisierung und Massenarbeit hatten schließlich eine erhebliche Nivellierung und Standardisierung der Arbeitsverhältnisse zur Folge. Relative gesellschaftliche Gleichheit in einer umfassenden »Arbeitnehmergesellschaft« schien Wirklichkeit zu werden.”翻译为中文","completion":"2. 从福特主义到后福特主义：20世纪初以来的资本主义发展 调节理论，如上一章概述的，有助于理解资本主义当前的结构变化。首先，解释福特主义的产生条件和结构很重要，其1970年代爆发的危机为被称为“全球化”的新自由主义重新结构全球资本主义提供了契机。 “福特主义”指的是自二战结束直到1970年代为止，在全球社会、经济和政治环境中（不仅是在资本主义世界中）占主导地位的资本主义历史形态。它起源于1930年代的世界经济危机及其引发的社会和政治动荡：美国的罗斯福“新政”，欧洲的法西斯主义，德国的纳粹统治，最终是第二次世界大战。其产生的一个决定性因素是俄国的十月革命、所谓的“社会主义阵营”的建立以及由此引发的东西方之间的体制冲突。这些事件从根本上改变了世界很多地区的社会结构、社会力量关系以及政治制度。紧随1930年代世界经济危机的动荡创造了政治和社会条件，使得新的“福特主义”资本主义形态能够在漫长且往往是血腥的斗争中确立。 福特主义的产生条件和结构 福特主义与美国的国际主导地位关联，美国不仅作为军事力量从两次世界大战中崛起，还发展了一种积累和调节方式，形成了一个经济和技术上优越、扩张性的社会和经济模型。不仅是军事优势，更多是它们的经济和社会结构奠定了美国的国际主导地位。这种主导地位在二战结束和随之而来的对苏联的冷战开始时期通过为了保障和扩大它们的军事和政治影响力而重新组织已崩溃的世界市场，为资本主义社会秩序在全球赋予物质合法性和发展前景而得以巩固。 因此，福特主义的产生主要归因于十月革命之后的国际力量格局。这不仅包括美国的军事和经济优势，还包括它的政治和文化霸权。美国控制了国际经济和政治机构，并塑造了社会的价值观念、生活方式和文化模式。不仅底特律的汽车制造业的流水线和加州的高科技军工厂成为结构和发展的决定性因素，好莱坞的电影工厂所展示的美式生活方式也同样重要。这使得20世纪实际上成为了“美国的世纪”。 这个资本主义历史时期被称为“福特主义”，是因为它回溯到亨利·福特于20世纪初在其汽车工厂中引入的泰勒式大规模生产。这改变了劳动组织的形式、整体经济循环、阶级结构、价值观念和生活方式，使得汽车作为大众消费品成为这个时代的标志性产品。尽管存在区域和国家差异，福特主义的结构还是有一些共同特征，这里仅限于概述最重要的基本特点（详见Hirsch/Roth 1986以及Hirsch 1990）。 福特主义的基本特征是在标准化大众消费品的大规模生产中实施泰勒式劳动组织。工作分解、集中准备和控制旨在通过不熟练的流水线工人替代具有手工技能的劳动者。社会中手工劳动与脑力劳动的分离因此发生了重大变化，导致劳动的强化和合理化。劳动生产率大幅提升，这反过来又促成了比较强劲和持续的经济增长。这为显著的工资增长提供了基础，构成了正在发展的大众消费的基础。资本主义历史上首次，工资收入的增加和一定程度的大众福利不仅与资本的盈利能力相容，甚至成为了它的基础。\\"永恒繁荣之梦\\"（Lutz 1984）——永久性的收入增长和由此逐渐消除阶级差异的愿景似乎成为现实。雇佣劳动者的消费创造了新的销售市场和资本投资机会。用经济学术语来说，工人阶级的再生产——即他们越来越多地以商品形式进行的消费——成为了资本增值的一个中心领域。在这个意义上，福特主义也标志着资本主义彻底历史性实现的一个决定性阶段。此时，社会的主要领域首次受到资本关系的支配。 这导致了社会的全面资本化，引发了社会关系和生活条件的深刻变革。家庭经济、小农业和手工业生产方式越来越难以抵抗工业化的大规模生产并逐渐失去其重要性。资本开始进行大规模的“内部土地兼并”（同上）。在新积累模式的条件下，经济进程集中在内需市场的开发上。这意味着，社会关系越来越多地被商业化，即按货币和交换方式组织。正式的雇佣劳动得到扩展，传统的再生产方式被工业生产的商品和商业化服务所取代。此时，资本主义社会主要成为了一个雇佣劳动者的社会。随着非资本主义生产方式的解体，家庭结构也发生了变化。在资本主义大都市中，以商品消费和劳动力再生产为限的小家庭成为普遍且横跨阶级的统治关系和生活形式。同时，工人阶级经历了深刻的重组和新的组成。通过削弱仍然具有手工业背景和对生产过程有全面了解的有技能工人的力量，资本能够进一步将工作过程置于其控制之下。在工业生产中不太熟练的员工比例扩大，不仅引发了妇女越来越多地参与工业生产过程，也成为大规模人口迁移和来自国民边界内外工业边缘地区的强大劳动力移民的基础。资本化、工业化和大规模劳动最终导致了劳动关系的显著标准化和均化。在全面的“雇员社会”中，相对社会平等似乎成为现实。"},{"prompt":"请将“Die Durchsetzung des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes führte dazu, dass die sozialen Lagen gleichförmiger wurden und die Eingliederung in das Lohnverhältnis die direkte Abhängigkeit vom Kapitalverwertungsprozess zum Massenschicksal machte. In der Soziologie wurde dies als Heraufkunft einer »nivellierten Mittelstandgesellschaft« gedeutet. Die Ausdehnung industrieller Frauenlohnarbeit und die Kleinfamiliarisierung veränderten die Geschlechterverhältnisse. Eine entscheidende Grundlage des fordistischen Modells von Industrialisierung, Durchkapitalisierung, Wachstum und Massenkonsum war schließlich die Verfügung über ein scheinbar unbegrenztes Reservoir an natürlichen Ressourcen. Schrankenlose Naturausbeutung - beispielhaft der Zusammenhang von Automobilisierung, Ölverbrauch und Luftverschmutzung - war mit dem fordisti- schen Akkumulationsregime untrennbar verbunden. Dies alles bezeichnet jedoch nur bestimmte, den Fordismus allgemein charakterisierende Tendenzen. Auch wenn der Taylorismus ein zentrales, die Formen der Arbeitsorganisation, die Klassenverhältnisse und Lebensweisen prägendes Merkmal des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes darstellt, so blieb seine Durchsetzung ungleichmäßig und unvollkommen. Nicht nur existierten erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den verschiedenen Ländern, sondern wichtige Sektoren der gesellschaftlichen Produktion wie etwa der Maschinenbau oder große Teile des Dienstleistungssektors blieben, da auf der Basis der vorhandenen Technologien nicht tay-loristisch rationalisierbar, davon zunächst ausgenommen. Dies sollte sich mit der Zeit als wichtige Barriere des Produktivitätsfortschritts erweisen. Das fordistische Akkumulationsregime konnte sich nur deshalb erfolgreich durchsetzen, weil im Zuge der sozialen Auseinandersetzungen und angesichts der veränderten Kräfteverhältnisse unter den Bedingungen der Systemkonkurrenz die Regulationsweise grundlegend umgestaltet wurde. Das Verschwinden traditioneller Produktions- und Lebensweisen, die Verallgemeinerung des Lohnverhältnisses und die Veränderung der Fa-milienformen brachte massenhafte soziale Risiken - etwa bei Krankheit, Arbeitslosigkeit und Alter - mit sich, die kollektive soziale Schutzmaßnahmen notwendiger machten. Zumindest in den kapitalistischen Metropolen und da auch in sehr unterschiedlichem Ausmaß gelang es den Organisationen der Arbeiterbewegung, den Ausbau des Sozialstaats voranzutreiben. Der Erfolg dieser Kämpfe erwies sich zunächst einmal als wichtiger Stabilitätsfaktor des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes. Die Einführung sozialstaatlicher Sicherungen diente nicht nur dazu, die Arbeitskräfte physisch zu erhalten und die Klassenauseinandersetzungen still zu stellen, sondern bildete auch ein wichtiges Mittel zur Stabilisierung des Massenkonsums. Auf der Basis verallgemeinerter und standardisierter Lohnarbeitsverhältnisse konnten sich starke und übergreifende Gewerkschaften bilden, denen unter den Bedingungen einer wachsenden Wirtschaft gewisse Spielräume zur Verbesserung der Einkommens- und Arbeitsbedingungen zur Verfügung standen. »Sozialpartnerschaftliche« und »korporative«, d.h. Gewerkschaften, Unternehmerverbände und den Staat umfassende kollektive Verhandlungssysteme setzten sich - ebenfalls wieder in unterschiedlicher Stärke - durch und wurden zu einer wichtigen Grundlage für die Steuerung der Wirtschaft. Die fordistische Regulationsweise beinhaltete damit eine zentralisierte und staatlich vermittelte Institutionalisierung des kapitalistischen Klassengegensatzes. Während sozialpartnerschaftliche Aushandlungsprozesse zu einem wichtigen Bestandteil der Regulation wurden, dehnte sich zugleich die soziale und ökonomische Interventionstätigkeit des Staates aus. Sozial-, Wachstums-, Forschungs-, Industrie- und Konjunkturpolitik, Unterstützungszahlungen und Subventionen sowie die Anwendung eines immer weiter ausgebauten gesamtwirtschaftlichen Steuerungsinstrumentariums - vor allem im Bereich der Geld- und Fiskalpolitik - wurden zum Merkmal des »key- nesianischen« Staates. Die makroökonomische Theorie von John M. Keynes, die die Notwendigkeit eines staatsadministrativen Instrumentariums zur Verstetigung des Wachstumsprozesses und zur Vermeidung konjunktureller Krisen begründet, begann ihren Siegeszug. Diese Entwicklung wurde durch die »Massen«- oder »Volksparteien« gestützt, d.h. von ideologisch eher diffusen und ihrem eigenen Anspruch nach klassenübergreifenden, bürokratischen und auf materielle Verteilungspolitik ausgerichteten politischen Apparaturen. Sie lösten die traditionellen, weltanschaulich und klassenmäßig ausgerichteten »bürgerlichen« und kommunistischsozialistischen Parteien allmählich ab. Der Fordismus ist auch die Ära der im weitesten Sinne »sozialdemokratisch« orientierten Reformparteien, die es sich zum Ziel setzten, mittels einer systematischen Wachstums-, Konjunktur- und Sozialpolitik eine allmähliche Verbesserung der Lebensverhältnisse breiter Schichten und eine Milderung kapitalistischer Risiken, Abhängigkeiten und Ungleichheiten zu erreichen. Die fordistische Regulationsweise beruhte demnach auf der Existenz umfassender gesellschaftlicher Großorganisationen, eines in weite gesell-schaftliche Bereiche intervenierenden Staates, bürokratischer Massenparteien, Gewerkschaften, Unternehmer-, Bauern-, Ärzte- und sonstigen Interessenverbänden, die den Anspruch erhoben, die kapitalistischen Marktprozesse ebenso wie die gesellschaftlichen Strukturen und Entwick-lungen durch zentralisierte Verhandlungen politisch zu steuern. Die Le-gitimation dieses politischen Systems beruhte auf seiner Fähigkeit, auf Grundlage eines beständigen wirtschaftlichen Wachstums materielle Ver-teilungspolitiken zugunsten fast aller gesellschaftlicher Schichten zu betreiben. Man bezeichnet diese Regulationsweise deshalb auch als »monopolistisch«. Charakteristisch für sie ist ein hoher Grad an zentralisierter Normierung und Steuerung, eine fortschreitende »Durchstaatlichung« vieler Lebensbereiche und ein erhebliches Maß an bürokratischer, partei- und verbandsmäßiger Kontrolle der Lebensweisen, des politischem Verhaltens, der Interessenartikulation und der Interessendurchsetzung. Der fordistische Staat war »Sicherheitsstaat« im doppelten Sinne des Wortes: als »Wohlfahrts«- und als bürokratischer »Kontroll- und Überwachungsstaat« (vgl. dazu Hirsch 1986, 1998).”翻译为中文","completion":"福特主义积累体制的确立导致社会地位变得更加均质化，而且融入雇佣劳动关系意味着大量人群直接依赖于资本增值过程。在社会学中，这被解释为“中产阶级社会”的出现。工业化女性的薪资劳动和小家庭化改变了性别关系。福特主义模型中工业化、资本主义渗透、增长和大规模消费的基础，最终是对看似无限自然资源的获取。无节制的自然开发——例如汽车化、石油消耗和空气污染的联系——与福特主义积累体制密不可分。 这些只是描述福特主义普遍趋势的一部分。即使泰勒主义是福特主义积累体制中一个核心且塑造劳动组织形式、阶级关系和生活方式的特征，其实施仍是不均匀和不完全的。不仅国家间存在显著差异，而且如机械制造业或服务业的重要部分，由于基于现有技术无法以泰勒主义方式实现合理化，因此最初被排除在外。这随时间被证明是生产力进步的重要障碍。 福特主义积累体制之所以能够成功确立，是因为随着社会冲突的发生和体制竞争下力量关系的变化，调节方式被根本性地重塑。传统的生产和生活方式消失，雇佣关系的普遍化和家庭形式的变化，带来了大量的社会风险——例如疾病、失业和老龄化——这些风险需要集体的社会保护措施。至少在资本主义大都市中，工人运动组织设法推动了社会福利国家的发展。这些斗争的成功最初被证明是福特主义积累体制的重要稳定因素。社会福利保障的引入不仅有助于维持劳动力并平息阶级冲突，而且还是稳定大规模消费的重要手段。在普遍化和标准化的雇佣劳动关系基础上，能够形成强大且具有广泛影响力的工会，它们在经济增长条件下有一定的空间提高收入和改善工作条件。“社会伙伴关系”和“公司治理”——即包括工会、企业家协会和政府的集体谈判系统——在不同程度上得以确立，并成为经济调节的重要基础。因此，福特主义调节方式涉及资本主义阶级对立的中央集权和国家调解的制度化。在社会伙伴关系谈判成为调节的重要组成部分的同时，国家的社会和经济干预活动也得到扩展。社会、增长、科研、工业和经济政策，以及财政支持和补贴措施的使用，还有不断扩大的宏观经济调控工具——尤其是在货币和财政政策领域——成为“凯恩斯主义”国家的特征。约翰·M·凯恩斯的宏观经济理论，它论证了为了稳定增长过程和避免经济周期性危机而需要国家管理工具的必要性，开始普及。这一发展得到了“大众”或“人民政党”的支持，即那些在意识形态上相对模糊并声称跨越阶级的、官僚化的、专注于物质再分配政策的政治机构。它们逐渐取代了传统的，基于世界观和阶级的“资产阶级”和共产主义-社会主义政党。“福特主义”时期也是广义上“社会民主主义”倾向的改革政党的时代，它们旨在通过系统的增长、经济和社会政策实现广泛阶层生活条件的逐步改善，并缓解资本主义风险、依赖性和不平等。 因此，福特主义的调节方式建立在广泛的社会大型组织、广泛干预社会领域的国家、官僚化的大型政党、工会、企业家、农民、医生和其他利益团体的存在基础上，它们声称通过中央集权的谈判政治调控资本主义市场过程以及社会结构和发展。“垄断型”是用来描述这种调节方式的，其特点是高度中央集权的规范和调控、许多生活领域的进一步“国家化”以及生活方式、政治行为、利益表达和利益实现的官僚、党派和协会控制的高度。福特主义国家是“安全国家”在两个意义上：作为“福利国家”和官僚化的“控制与监视国家”。"},{"prompt":"in this javascript the marker speed is not increasing when the improveBoilerButton is pressed - 'var money = 100000; var numberOfCarriages = 1; var speed = 60; const map = L.map(\\"map\\").setView([54.2231637, -1.9381623], 6); // Add custom zoom control to the map with position set to ‘topright’ const customZoomControl = L.control.zoom({ position: \\"topright\\" }).addTo(map); // Remove the default zoom control from the map map.removeControl(map.zoomControl); let clickedPoints = []; let isLineDrawn = false; let marker; // Declare the marker variable let progress = 0; const increaseSpeed = () => { const speedIncrease = 20; speed += speedIncrease; }; // Function to create circle markers with click functionality function createCircleMarkers(geojson) { return L.geoJSON(geojson, { pointToLayer: function (feature, latlng) { const circleMarker = L.circleMarker(latlng, { radius: 4, fillColor: \\"#ff7800\\", color: \\"#000\\", weight: 0.2, opacity: 1, fillOpacity: 0.8, }); // Attach the feature to the circle marker circleMarker.feature = feature; circleMarker.on(\\"mouseover\\", function () { this.bindPopup(feature.properties.city).openPopup(); }); circleMarker.on(\\"click\\", function (e) { if (!isLineDrawn) { clickedPoints.push(e.target); // Push the circle marker with attached feature if (clickedPoints.length === 2) { const firstCityCoords = clickedPoints[0].feature.geometry.coordinates; const secondCityCoords = clickedPoints[1].feature.geometry.coordinates; const polyline = L.polyline( clickedPoints.map((p) => p.getLatLng()) ).addTo(map); const firstCity = clickedPoints[0].feature.properties.city; const secondCity = clickedPoints[1].feature.properties.city; clickedPoints = []; isLineDrawn = true; // Remove click event listener after a line has been drawn map.off(\\"click\\"); // Set the map bounds to show the area with the polyline map.fitBounds(polyline.getBounds()); money = money - 50000; // Subtract 50000 from money const moneyDisplay = document.getElementById(\\"moneydisplay\\"); const moneyString = \`£{money}\`; // Assuming money is a number moneyDisplay.textContent = moneyString; const instructionsElement = document.getElementById(\\"instructions\\"); // Clear any existing content in the instructions element: instructionsElement.innerHTML = \\"\\"; // Create separate paragraph elements: const congratulationsParagraph = document.createElement(\\"p\\"); congratulationsParagraph.textContent = \`Congratulations you have built your first train line from {firstCity} to {secondCity}!\`; const costsParagraph = document.createElement(\\"p\\"); costsParagraph.textContent = \`Your construction costs were £50,000.

It seems that the code snippet provided earlier was already correct, and no further changes were needed in that specific area to address the issue with the marker speed not increasing. Given that the \`increaseSpeed()\` function is being correctly called when the \`improveBoilerButton\` is pressed, the issue may lie elsewhere in the code. Here are a few suggestions for troubleshooting: 1. Check for any errors in the browser console that might give more insight into the problem. 2. Verify that the \`speed\` variable is being updated correctly within the \`increaseSpeed()\` function. 3. Double-check the \`moveMarker(speed)\` function to ensure that it is using the updated \`speed\` value when restarting the animation. If the marker speed is still not increasing as expected, it may be helpful to review the entire code logic related to the marker movement and speed management to identify any potential issues.

Основной артефакт, Кристалл Мечтаний, спрятан в самом сердце Города Теней, в подземном храме, который служил культическим и образовательным центром для древних мудрецов и алхимиков. Вход в храм защищен древними загадками и механизмами, требующими как физической силы, так и остроты ума для их преодоления.
