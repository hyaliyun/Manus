As soon as Kang Woo-jin heard Miley Cara's words over the phone, he thought. ' Huh? Then?? ' Does that mean she's confirmed for the role of 'Beauty Bella'? Otherwise, the situation was strange. It was unlikely that Cara would call this early in the morning to play a prank. Still, Woo-jin checked first. Of course, his voice was as sharp as it could be. \\"...You called as 'Beauty Bella'. That means you're going with me.\\" \\"Right.\\" Whether she was in a hurry or not, Cara's laughter-filled voice cut off Woo-jin's words. \\"I became 'Beauty Bella'. It means we'll complete 'The Beast and the Beauty' together.\\" With the situation confirmed, the stern-faced Woo-jin exchanged glances with Choi Seong-geon in front of him for a moment. Choi Seong-geon, still holding a diary in his hand, was silently speaking to Woo-jin. Why? What's up? That kind of feeling. Instead of answering, Kang Woo-jin congratulated Cara and conveyed the situation. \\"Cara, congratulations on getting the role of 'Beauty Bella'.\\" \\"It feels strange, doesn't it? Of course, I thought I would be the one, but I'm happy.\\" \\"Since you congratulated me, I should do the same.\\" \\"Ah-ha- I thought Woo-jin had forgotten my congratulations.\\" \\"Please take care of me.\\" \\"Sure, 'Beast' sir. Please take care of me too.\\" As Woo-jin and Cara's conversation was going on, Choi Seong-geon and the team members around them were making quite a fuss. Choi Seong-geon quickly took out his phone, and the team members, including the stylist, were... \\"!!!\\" \\"Wow- Eup!\\" They danced with suppressed excitement. It seemed they all really hoped Cara would become the one. For the team members, it must have been convenient to work with Miley Cara, who had already matched well with Kang Woo-jin in several collaborations, from album work to 'Beneficial Evil'. Above all. \\"Wow, the 'The Beast and the Beauty' with Kang Woo-jin and Miley Cara is now being released worldwide??\\" \\"Totally, totally agree. The two of them look really pretty together.\\" \\"I want to see it soon. The chemistry between the two that I didn't see at the audition.\\" The whispers of the team members and their wishes indicated that the sync rate between Woo-jin and Cara was quite high. Woo-jin, who was indifferently watching such personnel, was inwardly pleased, yet... 'Heh, like it, like it.' His heartbeat quickened slightly. He might have become numb to the feeling because he saw her quite often, but the Miley Cara he was currently talking to was a top Hollywood superstar. He was going to shoot 'The Beast and the Beauty', which was loved all over the world, with her. Every single thing was astonishing. How could he express this strange emotion? No, now was the time to stay calm. Stay composed. Woo-jin, who had heavily laid on the concept, spoke low into the phone. \\"This makes it our second project together.\\" Miley Cara's laughter deepened over the phone. \\"'Beneficial Evil' was actually a bit disappointing because it was short. To me, 'The Beast and the Beauty' feels like the first one. And the company will contact you, but how about we do a YouTube shoot?\\" A YouTube shoot? Woo-jin, who was puzzled inwardly, remained silent, and Cara spoke again. \\"We haven't filmed since my album. As 'The Beast' and 'Beauty Bella', greeting the world fans, 'World Disney Pictures' also said that would be no problem. I had already asked.\\" Woo-jin didn't mind. \\"Let's do that.\\" By this time, Choi Seong-geon, who had confirmed the foreign news article that Cara was confirmed as 'Beauty Bella' on his phone, was. -Swish. He raised his head and looked at Kang Woo-jin in front of him. It was a newfound curiosity. Just a few years ago, he had fallen for the 'Deputy Park' role, and now Kang Woo-jin was on the phone as the lead of 'The Beast and the Beauty' with Hollywood superstar Miley Cara. In the heart of Hollywood, LA. For a moment, something surged in the heart of Choi Seong-geon with a ponytail. '......You're already a monster. No, a world star, Woo-jin!' Around this time, from Woo-jin's phone again. \\"The announcement has already been made.\\" Cara's voice was heard again. \\"It's going to be noisy for a while again, isn't it?\\" In the background. After finishing the call with Miley Cara, Kang Woo-jin got into a van to move to the next schedule, and during the trip, he checked the reactions of the foreign press. What more to say? 'Wow- see, the articles are exploding???' The articles were already spreading across the entire United States beyond LA. 『CNM/'World Disney Pictures' official announcement, 'The Beast and the Beauty's 'Beauty Bella' is confirmed to be Miley Cara!』 『LA TIMES/'Beauty Bella' is Miley Cara's! The live-action 'The Beast and the Beauty' is completed by Kang Woo-jin and Miley』 『ABY/It's the first time the casting announcement has been this fast, how high is the sync rate between Kang Woo-jin and Miley Cara?』 The articles were pouring out with excitement that could be felt. 『NT/Kang Woo-jin is unexpected, Miley Cara is as expected, what kind of picture will the two actors create for 'The Beast and the Beauty'?』 It was quite justifiable. 'The Beast and the Beauty' made a hit with the announcement of the live-action, another hit with the confirmation of Kang Woo-jin as 'The Beast', and now with Miley Cara. Plus, it was a work that exploded with interest from the general public worldwide, so this level of reaction was natural. 『BBX/Following Kang Woo-jin, the confirmation of Miley Cara as 'Beauty Bella' stirs up the world public again!』 By this point, from the many film companies in Hollywood to the actors and so on, they had already noticed, and it was only a matter of time before the media worldwide would be aware. And just like that, a few days flew by in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, it was Monday, March 7th. \\"Hello? 'Beast' sir?\\" \\"...Hello, Miley.\\" \\"Ah! What's that, you should call me 'Beauty Bella' too.\\" \\"Let's do that next time.\\" \\"How boring.\\" That day, Kang Woo-jin had a YouTube shoot with Miley Cara. Of course, it was a video to be used for both Woo-jin's 'Kang Woo-jin's alter ego' and Cara's YouTube channels. The format was roughly. -♫♪ A duet song presented to the world fans, a simple greeting from the two actors, and a bit of a story from the audition. The running time wasn't very long, but the impact of the video, which was first uploaded to the 'Kang Woo-jin's alter ego' channel two days later, was tremendous. -Views: 2.02 million It surpassed 2 million views in less than 30 minutes. March 12th, early afternoon, Korea. The location was a rather large event hall inside a large building in Seoul. First and foremost, what caught the eye were the dozens of reporters. From the entrance of the hall to the back, they were positioned. There were seats that could accommodate at least 500 people and a fairly large stage in front, and in the hall currently filled with hundreds of people, many big names were visible. Director Kwon Ki-taek with a genial face, Director Kim Do-hee, known for 'Drug Dealer', and Director Shin Dong-chun of 'Detective Agency' among many others. All of them were sitting here as judges. Dozens of famous directors, honorary judges, top actors, invited directors, special guest foreign directors, invited actors and entertainers, and well-known industry stakeholders, etc. In front of the hall, filled with distinguished figures, hung this phrase. -'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival' It was the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival', a domestic 'Blue Dragon' level short film festival and also known as a gateway to the film industry. Now, after about a week's schedule, the closing and award ceremony was in full swing. \\"We will now begin the award ceremony.\\" Following the announcer's proclamation, various reporters flashed their cameras. -Papapapapapak! -Papapapapapapapak! Then the first award. \\"Short Film Selection\\" The award was given by Director Shin Dong-chun, who made his directorial debut here with 'Detective Agency'. As the square-jawed director took the stage, among the hundreds of people gathered in the audience, the rookie directors who had staked their lives on this film festival clapped and opened their mouths one by one. \\"That's Director Shin Dong-chun, the real director who made it big at the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival'.\\" \\"Jealous. The lead actor of his debut work was none other than Kang Woo-jin.\\" \\"But Kang Woo-jin was a rookie back then.\\" \\"What does it matter? Kang Woo-jin became a world star in just three years. I heard 'Detective Agency' is being remade overseas. The work was good, but from what I see, it's definitely because of Kang Woo-jin's influence that it got attention overseas.\\" In the audience, there were numerous rookie directors, and they were generally bursting with envy at Director Shin Dong-chun. \\"Whatever it is, Director Shin deserves to be proud, right? His debut work is 'Detective Agency', Kang Woo-jin's first movie. If it were me, I'd brag about it to my descendants.\\" \\"Starting together as rookies, Kang Woo-jin hit 10 million the next year, then swept the top 1 to 3 spots of all-time Korean movies. Now he's a Hollywood star. If I were Director Shin, I'd be a bit anxious.\\" \\"No, Director Shin Dong-chun is also working on a big movie now.\\" While the rookie directors were chattering, Director Shin Dong-chun on stage was handing over the trophy. After that, various awards such as selection, bronze, and gold continued. \\"Now it's time for the Actor Award. From this year, only the grand prize will be presented.\\" It was time for the actors' award, known as the 'Acting Grand Prize'. Immediately, the hundreds of rookie actors in the audience seats became anxious. \\"...I want to receive it. I really want to receive the 'Kang Woo-jin Award'.\\" The rookie actors also expressed their current feelings to the people they came with. \\"If you get the 'Kang Woo-jin Award', will it definitely make the news?\\" \\"Yes, 100%. Whatever it is, as soon as Kang Woo-jin's name is attached, it becomes a hot topic.\\" \\"Please- please call my name.\\" Interestingly, the rookie actors were calling the 'Acting Grand Prize' the 'Kang Woo-jin Award'. \\"Why are so many rookie actors gathered this year- ah, I'm doomed.\\" \\"....Everyone's just like you, aiming for the 'Kang Woo-jin Award'. The first recipient was Kang Woo-jin, and that award was Kang Woo-jin's first trophy. Afterward, the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival' Acting Grand Prize became Kang Woo-jin's mascot.\\" Because Kang Woo-jin received the 'Acting Grand Prize' trophy at the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival'. Moreover, the year Woo-jin won the award was the first appearance of the 'Acting Grand Prize' and also Kang Woo-jin's first trophy. In other words. \\"Everyone dreams of Kang Woo-jin like you.\\" Kang Woo-jin had become the symbol of the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival' rookie 'Acting Grand Prize'. Since then, every rookie actor and director attending the film festival called the 'Acting Grand Prize' the 'Kang Woo-jin Award'. The award's power seemed to have multiplied several times with Kang Woo-jin's name attached. The press and the industry rated it highly. So the rookie actors couldn't help but drool. \\"Phew, but... Director Shin Dong-chun came this year, isn't Kang Woo-jin senior coming?\\" \\"Why would a guy who's hanging out with Hollywood top actors in LA come here? He's busy meeting with Hollywood's 'Big Five' film companies.\\" \\"...I just want to see Kang Woo-jin, my role model, at least once.\\" \\"If you get this and work hard to death, maybe you'll cross paths with him once, right? Let's hope.\\" Thus, numerous rookie actors prayed for the 'Kang Woo-jin Award', hoping that his halo would shine on them a little too. Please, please let his afterglow shine on me too. Before long. Or rather, Kang Woo-jin had already become more than an idol for all rookie actors in Korea. In terms of popularity, he was almost god-like. At a glance, the rookie actors praying seemed almost like the followers of the 'Church of Kang Woo-jin'. At that moment. \\"'Acting Grand Prize', the person who will present the award is-\\" The male announcer, who was about to proceed, stopped speaking. A staff member of the film festival whispered something in his ear. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he whispered back to the staff. \\"Is it, is it really? He's here right now?\\" If the announcer didn't know, then none of the hundreds of people in the hall would know. Anyway, the shocked announcer, with a somewhat stunned face, reluctantly raised the handheld microphone again. \\"...Ah, um, sorry. Let's proceed again. The 'Acting Grand Prize', a really amazing person will present the award.\\" At his comment, the reporters positioned at the very back of the audience began to murmur. \\"An amazing person?

I'm hearing it for the first time.\\" \\"Me too, it's my first time hearing it.\\" \\"I don't know, just shoot first.\\" The reporters raised question marks but instinctively picked up their cameras. Of course, from Director Kwon Ki-taek in front of the stage to the big-name directors, top actors, and especially many rookie directors and actors, they were noticeably buzzing. Then the flustered announcer spoke again. \\"Then, please come up.\\" The sound of footsteps echoed on the stage, and then. -Swish. A black-haired man in a suit with an indifferent face appeared. As soon as the man's face was visible, the rookie directors and actors in the audience gasped and exclaimed without realizing it. \\"Gasp!!\\" Their idol, who had received the 'Acting Grand Prize' here and ascended to 'World Star' in just three years. \\"Ka, Kang Woo-jin?!!\\" It was Kang Woo-jin. Immediately, hundreds of rookie directors and actors showed movements similar to seizures. \\".....It's really him, Kang Woo-jin, amazing - wow, crazy\\" Their eyes were wide open, which was understandable. They never imagined they would see him so close. \\"The aura is like...\\" On the other hand, Kang Woo-jin, the actual owner of the 'Kang Woo-jin Award' that turned everyone upside down, was unfazed. He leisurely scanned the hundreds of rookies and then spoke into the microphone. His tone was very low. \\"It's interesting, the situation where I'm giving an award with my name on it.\\" Kang Woo-jin had returned to Korea. Compared to before his departure. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woo-jin.\\" He was in a position not just of S-grade, but of a god-grade. < Loud Sound (5) > End"},{"prompt":"Вариант 2 1.

ظروف درامية وقد ساعدته هذه القدرة على التغلب على محنة ما في الماضي. 2. **العلاقات بين الشخصيات**: يبدو أن العلاقات مهمة في هذه القصة. يمكنك استكشاف وتطوير الديناميكيات بين بلال وآيه وكيف يؤثر حبهما على قراراتهما خلال القصة. 3. **النزاعات**: تعتمد القصص الجيدة على النزاعات لتحريك الأحداث. يمكن لنزاع بين يحيى وستيفن أن يضيف تشويقاً ويقدم لحظات قوية، خاصة عندما يضحي يحيى بنفسه في النهاية. 4. **المحور الدرامي**: جهود ستيفن لسرقة خاتم رمسيس الثاني يمكن أن تكون محوراً رئيسياً للقصة، ويمكنك التطرق لكيفية تعاون الأبطال لإحباط خطته، وهذا يمكن أن يضمن وجود جو من المغامرة والإثارة. 5. **تطوير المشاهد**: يمكنك كتابة مشاهد مفصلة توضح فيها كيفية استخدام كل شخصية لقدراتها الخارقة، وكذلك أوصاف تشكل تصويرًا حيًا للمعارك والتحديات التي يواجهونها. 6. **التطور الشخصي**: وجود مسار تطور واضح للشخصيات يعزز من عمق القصة. على سبيل المثال، يمكن لآيه العمل خلال القصة على التغلب على غيرتها وبلال يمكنه تعلم كيفية تحمل المزيد من المسؤولية كبطل خارق. 7. **النهاية**: النهايات القوية تترك ذكرى دائمة لدى القراء. موت يحيى يمكن أن يكون علامة فارقة درامية ومؤثرة تولد تعاطفاً عميقاً مع القراء. 8. **المغزى الأخلاقي**: يمكنك استخدام القصة للتطرق إلى مواضيع أخلاقية مثل قيمة التضحية وأهمية الشجاعة والحب. مع

السكون أنحاءه كستار قاتم. تحرك اللص بخفة بين ظلال الليل، متجنباً بحذر أنظار الحراس النائمين عند مدخل المتحف الفخم. شعر بنشوة الانتصار وهو يتسلق الجدران الشاهقة بمهارة واحترافية. لطالما حلم بهذه اللحظة، لحظة الحصول على الكنز الذي سيجلب له الشهرة والثراء. وصل أخيراً إلى الغرفة التي طال انتظاره لها، غرفة يحتفظ بها المتحف بأغلى كنوزه. كان الخاتم معلقاً خلف الزجاج، يتألق بين القطع الأثرية الأخرى. شعر اللص بأنفاسه تتسارع وهو يكسر الزجاج بحركة خاطفة، كأنه يخطف لؤلؤة ثمينة من محيط هائج. أمسكه أخيراً بين يديه، ذلك الخاتم الأسطوري الذي يجعل من مالكه شخصاً لا يقهر. ابتسم اللص ابتسامة المنتصر الواثق، وهو يغادر المتحف كظل يختفي مع أول شعاع صباحي. الآن، مصير العالم بين يديه. ********** صعد بلال ببطء السلالم المؤدية إلى شقة عائلة آية في الطابق الرابع، ممسكاً بباقة من الزهور في يده اليمنى وصندوق من الشوكولاتة السويسرية المستوردة في يده الأخرى. على الرغم من محاولته تهدئة أعصابه، كان يسمع دقات قلبه بوضوح ينبض بسرعة في صدره. لا يمكنه أن يصدق أن هذا اليوم قد حان أخيرًا لمقابلة والد آية. منذ اللحظة التي التقى فيها بها لأول مرة في المستشفى ادرك انها الشخص الذي انتظره طوال حياته وانها هي الفتاة التي يريد ان يعيش معها الى الأبد. ادرك كل هذا بمجرد رؤيتها وتأكد منه عندما عرفها جيدا. توقف بلال أمام الباب وأخذ نفسًا عميقًا، ثم طرق بلطف. فتحت اخت ايه الصغرى (جودي) الباب ومن خلفها والدتها التي ابتسمت في سعادة. \\"أهلاً بك يا بلال! كنا ننتظرك، تفضل يا حبيبي!\\" صاحت وهي ترحب به إلى الداخل بحفاوة. كانت الشقة مريحة ومضاءة بشكل جميل، مع صور العائلة تزين الجدران. امتلأت الهواء بعطر طبق الملوخيه المميز الذي تعده والدة آية. ظهرت آية من المطبخ، تبدو مشرقة في ثوب وردي يتناسب مع بشرتها البيضاء كبياض الثلج الناعمة. \\"مرحباً بك بلال\\"، استقبلته بصوت هادئ وعيونها تلمع وعلى وجهها ابتسامة خجولة. في حالة من الارتباك، رد بلال التحية. . جلس بلال بحذر على الأريكة، وقد بدأ يتحدث بلباقة فيما ينتظرون وصول والد آية. كان ذهنه مشتتًا تمامًا، يفكر بعمق في العبارات المناسبة التي ستخرج من فمه أمام والد آية، آملاً أن يترك انطباعًا طيبًا في نفسه، ويأخذ موافقته السخية على ارتباطه بابنته الحبيبة. جلست آية في زاوية الغرفة ، ترمقه بنظرات خجولة كلما أعرض بنظره عنها سمع بلال خطوات ثقيلة تقترب، فدخل والد آية الغرفة. كان رجلاً طويل القامة وعريض المنكبين، ذا حضور هادئ و ابتسامه ودودة. صافحه بلال معرّفًا نفسه، فرحّب به الوالد معرّفًا نفسه بأحمد. \\"أهلاً وسهلاً بك في منزلنا يا بلال. نحن نتشرف باستضافتك، ونتشوق للتعرف على الشاب الذي جذب انتباه ابنتنا\\". \\"الشرف لي، سيدي\\"، أجاب بلال باحترام. تلاشى التوتر وجلست العائلة لتناول الطعام، فبدأ الحديث يجري بشكل عفوي وطبيعي. شعر بلال بالاسترخاء والتشجيع من كرم أسرة آية . وفي الختام ، وجّه أحمد الحديث نحو عائلة بلال وخلفيته وآماله المستقبلية، مصغيًا باهتمام لإجاباته الصادقة. فتحدّث بلال بإخلاص عن مشاعره، آملاً أن يعكس إحساسه بمسؤوليته تجاه عائلته ارتسمت على شفتي أحمد ابتسامة خفيفة، وتحرّك رأسه في إيماءة موافقة صامتة، مُعبِّرًا بتلك الحركتين عن رضاه وقبوله لشخصية الشاب الودود. لكن فجأة، دوّى صوت المذيع الجهوري من جهاز التلفزيون في غرفة المعيشة المجاورة، كالرعد المفاجئ ، معلنا عن نبأً عاجلاً أثار الدهشة والاستغراب لدى الحضور. \\"وردت للتو إلينا أنباء غير مؤكدة عن عملية سطو في المتحف المصري في ميدان التحرير في قلب القاهرة. وحسب مصدر مجهول الهوية، استطاع بضعة لصوص التسلل بحيلة ما متجاوزين الحراسة المشددة ، وسرقوا قطعة أثرية ثمينة في ساعات الليل الأخيرة. ورغم أن السلطات لم تفصح عن تفاصيل حتى الآن، إلا أن مصدرنا يشير إلى أن القطعة المسروقة ليست سوى خاتم رمسيس الأسطوري الشهير. ويعتقد علماء الآثار أن هذا الخاتم الفرعوني العريق كان يتيح في الماضي لملوك مصر التحكم بجيوشهم الوفية وكنوزهم السحرية. وسنوافيكم بالمزيد من التفاصيل عند توفرها...\\". اعترى بلال الذهول، متجمداً في مكانه كتمثال من الرخام، والشوكة معلقة في يده دون حراك، واللون يتلاشى من وجنتيه كورقة شاحبة. خاتم رمسيس - سُرِق؟! كيف استطاع أحد أن يسرق تلك القطعة الثمينة من دون سابق إنذار؟ ارتفعت دقات قلب بلال تدريجياً كطبول الحرب، لسبب مختلف تماماً هذه المرة. لاحظت آية قلقه، وسألت بقلق، \\"بلال، ما الذي يحدث؟\\" تلعثم بلال في الرد، غير متيقن كيف يعبر عن قلقه دون أن يفصح عن الكثير. \\"أنا... حسناً... ذلك الخاتم كنز لا يُقدَّر بثمن من تراث مصر العريق. إنه أمر مؤلم للغاية أن نتخيل أنه ربما اختفى إلى الأبد\\". وأبدى أحمد اندهاشه. قائلاً: \\"بالفعل أنباء مؤسفة للغاية!. خاصة إذا كانت الأساطير حول قدراته السحرية صحيحة, على أي نحو. لا نستطيع سوى أن نأمل أن تعثر السلطات عليه في أسرع وقت.\\" أومأ بلال، ولكن في داخله ، شعر فقط بتزايد الرعب كالسيل الهادر. فبصرف النظر عن قيمته المادية أو أهميته التاريخية، فإن قدرات ذلك الخاتم إن وقعت في أيدي الأشرار قد تحدث كارثة لا يمكن تخيلها. شعر بلال أن عليه فعل شيء ما. مر الجزء المتبقي من المساء ، حاول بلال قدر الإمكان أن يظهر تركيزه في المحادثة. أخيرًا، قدم أحمد موافقته لبلال وآية لمواصلة رؤية بعضهما البعض تحت إشرافه حتى تتم خطبتهما. بعد وقت طويل ، استطاع بلال أخيرًا أن يعتذر بلطف عن استكمال الليلة معهم، متظاهرًا بالإرهاق بسبب عمله في المستشفى لوقت طويل . رافقته آية إلى الباب، وبينما تراقب عائلتها بفضول من بعيد، ضغط بلال على يدها برفق ثم ودّعها بابتسامة حاول بها ان يخفي خوفه مما هو قادم. ما إن خرج بلال من العمارة حتى أخرج هاتفه بيدٍ مرتعشة، وتصفّح سريعاً جهات الاتصال حتى وقعت عيناه على الاسم \\"يحيى\\"، فضغط على زر الاتصال وهو يخطو باتجاه محطة المترو بعجلةٍ وفزع. بعد رنّتين، سمع صوت يحيى المرح يردّ: \\"بلال صديقي! كيف...\\". قاطعه بلال بنبرة جادّة: \\"يحيى.. لدينا مشكلة!\\" وشرع يصف السرقة، فارتسم الذعر على مَحْيا يحيى وارتجف صوته: \\"إنها كارثة يا صديقي! ذلك الخاتم...\\". قاطعه بلال: \\"أعلم.. يجب الاجتماع لنخطّط للخطوة التالية\\". أيّد يحيى الاقتراح بتفهم ، واتُّفق على اجتماعهما في شقة بلال فور وصوله. بعد أن أنهى بلال المكالمة، نزل مسرعًا إلى محطة المترو، وهو يحمل على كاهله ثقل المهمّة وكأنها جبل ضخم يضغط عليه من كل جانب. كانت رحلة المترو القصيرة إلى شقّته المتواضعة في قلب المدينة هادئةً مخيفةً. دخل الشقة الخالية، فرشّ بالماء على وجهه المتعب وبدّل ملابسه سريعًا، ثم جمع أغراضًا في حقيبته، ومنها دفتر رسوماته وأقلامه. سيحتاجها قريبًا، فهي وسيلته الوحيدة للوصول لقدرات تفوق قدرات البشر العاديين، كتلك التي منحها خاتم رمسيس لملوك الزمان الغابر. بعد لحظات، طرق أحدهم الباب. فتح بلال ليجد يحيى يرتدي نظارات شمسية رياضية على الرغم من ظلمة الليل. دخل صديقه مرتديًا ملابس أنيقة كالمعتاد، بالإضافة إلى قلادة فضية حول رقبته مزخرفة على شكل فأس. سأل يحيى مباشرة: \\"ما هي الخطوة التالية؟\\" أجاب بلال: \\"يجب معرفة المزيد عن من سرق الخاتم، أخشى حدوث كارثة إن وقع بأيدي خاطئة\\". أيده يحيى قائلاً: \\"أتفق معك، نحن الوحيدون القادرون على مواجهة هذا التحدي\\". نظر إليه بلال بجدية ورفع دفتره. تنهد يحيى \\"حسنًا، من أين نبدأ؟\\".. \\"لدي بعض المعارف في أروقة المتحف، ربما يزودنا احدهم بمعلومات سرية عن السرقة. سأتصل بهم فوراً. وفي الوقت نفسه، عليك التواصل مع أخيك يوسف، فربما تفيدنا علاقاته بأشخاص ذي سلطة لمعرفة بعض الحقائق\\". وافق يحيى وانصرف للاتصال بأخيه يوسف، الطيار في القوات الجوية المصرية. انتقل بلال الى دفتر الرسم، يتصفحه ببطء. كانت عيناه تتأملان الصفحات بعمق، وكأنها تحاولان قراءة أعماق نفسه. هل سيكون قادرًا حقًا على استخدام تلك القوى الغامضة التي اكتسبها في الأغراض النبيلة؟ هل سيستطيع أن يكون بطلاً حقيقيًا، يدافع عن الأبرياء وينشر العدل كما وعد والده قبل رحيله؟ آمل من كل قلبه أن ينجح في اجتياز هذا الاختبار. كان مصير البشرية معلقًا على كتفيه . بعد سلسلة من المكالمات الهاتفية المتوترة، اجتمع الصديقان وجهاً لوجه لمقارنة ما توصلا إليه من معلومات. أكد بلال ما سمعه من مصادره في المتحف - أن الخاتم الأسطوري قد سرق بالفعل، لكن بدون أي تفاصيل إضافية. أما يوسف فذكر أن السلطات الأمنية على علم تام بالوضع، لكنها تحافظ على السرية في الوقت الراهن. تنهد الاثنان بإحباط وهما يدركان أنهما في طريق مسدود. يبدو أنهما بمفردهما في مواجهة هذا الخطر الداهم، مع قليل من المعلومات والدعم. لكنهما عاقدان العزم على مواصلة البحث وحل هذا اللغز، مهما كلف الأمر. \\"يبدو أننا سنكون وحدنا في هذا يا صديقي،\\" استنتج يحيى بنبرة متشائمة. لكن بلال رفع رأسه بثقة وقال: \\"لا أعرف ماذا يحمل لنا الغد، ولكن الليلة سنستعد. سنجمع قوانا ونخطط للمعركة القادمة. فالظلام لن ينتصر طالما ما زالت شعلة الأمل مضاءة في قلوبنا.\\" شعر يحيى بالطمأنينة أمام ثقة صديقه، فقال: \\"أنت محق يا صديقي. هيا بنا نستعد.\\" قضى الصديقان الساعات التالية منهمكين في التخطيط والاستعداد للمواجهة الحتمية.ومع ذلك، في النهاية تغلب عليهما الإرهاق والتعب.. \\"احصل على بعض الراحة \\"، قال يحيى، وهو يكبت تثاؤبًا. \\"سنحتاج قوتنا ونشاطنا في الأيام المقبلة. كما أنني يجب أن أعود إلى المنزل قبل أن تبدأ ميريهان في القلق والتساؤل عني. أنت تعرف مدى شكها المستمر بي!\\" ضحك بلال قائلاً: \\"نعم أعرف، هي امرأة رائعة وهي تفعل ذلك لانها تحبك. حسنًا، اذهب واحصل على قسط من الراحة. سنلتقي غدًا لمتابعة التخطيط.\\" ************************* عاد يحيى إلى منزله منهكاً بعد يوم طويل ومرهق. كانت الشقة هادئة ومظلمة باستثناء غرفة النوم حيث رأى ميريهان جالسة أمام المرآة تمشط شعرها الأسود الطويل استعداداً للنوم. تقدم نحوها بهدوء وقبّل رأسها بحنان. نَظَرَتْ إليه في المرآة بابتِسامةٍ دَافِئَةٍ، ثُمَّ فجأة تلاشت ابتسامتها ، وسألته بلهجة حادة:\\"أين كنتَ حتى هذه الساعة المتأخرة؟ أرجو أن تكون قضيتَ وقتاً طيباً مع إحداهن\\" تنهد يحيى محاولا السيطرة على غضبه وقال: \\"أعتذر يا عزيزتي، كنت منهمكاً في العمل ولم أنتبه للوقت. أعدك أنني سأحاول جاهداً عدم تكرار هذا مرة أخرى.\\" تجاهل يحيى تلميحها الأخير، حتى لا تشتعل مشاجرة أخرى بينهما. دومًا ما يشعر أنها تحاول تقييد حريته، تريده أن يقطع علاقته بكل صديقاته الفتيات التي عرفهم من قبل أن تدخل حياته، تريده أن ينقطع عن ليالي السهر التي اعتاد عليها مع أصدقاءه. لقد عرفته هكذا وقبلت به لماذا تحاول الآن تغييره. لماذا تشكك دوماً في حبه لها؟! درست ميريهان وجهه بتمعّن، وكان واضحاً أنها لم تقتنع. لكنها أومأت ببساطة: \\"حسناً! لننام\\" كانت تأمل أن يتغير ويشعر بالمسؤولية مع مرور الوقت، لكنه مازال كما هو.، ظنت ان سهراته ولهوه كان مجرد نزوة وانه عندما يشعر بالمسؤولية والارتباط فإنه سيتغير ، لكن ماذا تفعل هي تحبه، حتى لو سهر مع غيرها هي ترغب به ، دائما ما تغفر له وهو دائما ما يعود اليها. شعر يحيى بالذنب تجاه ميريهان. ولكن الكشف عن الحقيقة سيعرضها للخطر بشكل أكبر. ربما ظنت انه يخونها، لكن هذا أفضل من أن يثقل كاهلها بهذا العبء الثقيل في الوقت الراهن. ربما ستعرف غدا حين يحل الشر ويعم أرجاء البلاد. احتضن كل منهما الآخر في سريرهما، وغاص كلٌ في أفكاره...","completion":"لقد وصلتني الفصول الأولى من قصتك وهي تحمل مزيجًا رائعًا من الأجواء الغامضة والتأسيس لعالم خارق يمتزج بالواقع المعاصر. إليك بعض الملاحظات وردود الفعل: 1. **الجو المعين**: تمكنت بنجاح من خلق جو من التشويق والغموض من خلال تفاصيل مثل السرقة في المتحف والأجواء الداخلية لمنزل آية. 2. **التناقض بين الأحداث**: تستخدم التناقض بشكل جيد، حيث تعرض مشهد سطو متحف مشحون بالتوتر ومن ثم تنقل القارئ إلى مشهد عائلي دافئ في منزل آية. هذا يخلق إيقاعًا متوازنًا يتيح للقارئ الانتقال بين لحظات الراحة والتشويق. 3. **الشخصيات**: الشخصيات ملونة وعليها أنماط مختلفة وواضحة. بلال ويحيى لديهم كيمياء جيدة كفريق، كما تبرزين الديناميكيات المعقدة في علاقاتهم العاطفية مع آية وميريهان. 4. **التفاصيل الثقافية**: استخدمت عناصر ثقافية مثل طبق الملوخية لتعزيز الأجواء، وهذا يقدم لقارئ أصالة وعمق الإعداد المصري. 5. **النهاية والانتقال**: الانتقال بين المشاهد جيد ويعطي حافزًا للقارئ لمعرفة ما سيحدث في الفصل القادم، وهذا يعتبر أساسيًا في بداية القصة. 6. **اللغة والأسلوب**: الأسلوب السردي يعكس بشكل جيد المشاعر والأحداث. الوصف متنوع ويعمل جيدًا لتصوير الأحاسيس والمواقف. بعض الأفكار للتفكير فيها أو العمل عليها: - **تنويع الجمل**: قد ترغب في مراجعة الجمل لتفادي الإفراط في استخدام هياكل جملية متشابهة لجعل السرد أكثر ديناميكية. - **تطوير الشخصيات الثانوية**:

لأسلوب كاتب معيّن قد تكون مهمة صعبة، ولكنني سأحاول محاكاة نمط سردي يمكن أن يتشابه مع أسلوب ستان لي الذي كان يعرف بنصوصه المشحونة بالحماس والتفاصيل الحيوية. إليك الفصل الثاني: --- # الفصل الثاني: \\"أصول القوة\\" كانت شمس القاهرة الحارقة تميل نحو المغيب، تلقي بأشعتها الذهبية على استوديو رسام قديم في حي المعادي. الغرفة مليئة باللوحات والرسوم التي تروي حكايات مصورة، غنية بالألوان والأساطير. وفي وسطها، وجدنا بلال، طفل صغير ذو عيون فضولية، يحمل في يده قلم رصاص عتيق كان فيما مضى لجده العظيم. مع كل خط يرسمه بلال، يرقب بحذر ومتعة كل خط يخطف الأبصار، والألوان تنبض وكأنها ترتعد برغبة الحياة. وفي لحظة لا مثيل لها، ارتعشت الصفحة وتحرك الأسد الذي رسمه ببراعة خارج حدود الورق، يصبح حيوانا مهيبا يجوب الغرفة، مصدرًا زئيره الضخم الودود. في ذات الوقت، في حديقة الأورمان المورقة التي تنثر عبقها تحت سماء الجيزة، تجوب آية الدروب المتخفية برفقة كوكبة من الفراشات الملونة جابت الهواء حولها. أطلقت الأهازيج الصامتة وتلك المخلوقات الصغيرة تطير لتهمس لها أسرار السماء والأرض. حُقُّ لها أن تشعر بأنّها واحدة منها، فقد تصاعدت أجنحتها الوردية الخفية من ظهرها، وحلّقت بين الفراشات بحرية. مكان آخر، موقع أثري بسقارة حيث الأطفال يجتمعون حول مخيم والنيران تتمايل بحنان الأم. يحيى، والدهجة تعلو وجهه، يقف هناك بينهم، وعلى غير المعتاد، يملك اللهب بحركات يديه الصغيرتين. يرفعه لأعلى، ينخفض، يتحول إلى رقصات عرائس الظلال وفيق الرمال المتلألئة. وفي قلبه يعلم، هذا لهب الحماية وليس الدمار. وفي جامعة القاهرة، حيث الشباب يناقشون ويتجادلون، تقف ميريهان، وهيبتها تطغى على الجمع. كلماتها تتسلل إلى قلوب الجميع كالسحر الأبدي، تحمل السلام والاقتناع لأحر النقاشات. ومن خلال عينيها التي ترى أبعد من مجرد وجوه الشباب، استشعرت، للمرة الأولى، قوتها في تغيير العقول والأفئدة. ولكن، على الرغم من روعة القدرات التي حُبيت لهم، كانت هناك أوزار ووعود، حملت القليل من الظلال لهالاتهم المضيئة. فقد عاهدوا، أحناء قلوبهم النيرة، على أن يحملوا هذه الهبات معهم مدافعين عن مصر وشعبها، وليس مكسبين لذواتهم. وهكذا، في ختام الفصل، يدركون بنبل القدرات ومسؤولية الاختيار الفذ الذي أمامهم. --- يستعيد القارئ نفسه بعد هذا الفلاش باك، ليجد الأبطال مجتمعين مجددًا، مدركين لحمل أعباء القدرات، ولكن أيضًا مدركين أنهم معًا يشكلون قوة لا يستهان بها، جاهزين للدفاع عن الحق ومواجهة الشر."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI

'.....스,스페인어??!' 다들커진눈으로우진을바라봤다. 그러거나말거나그는무심한표정에변화가없다. 그저한걸음거리의마리아를응시할뿐. 그쯤마리아가미간을좁혔다. “방금- 뭐라고했나요? ” 역시나스페인어였고일단자존심을내세웠다. 뒷담걸린것은좀그랬지만, 강우진이뱉은말이영거슬렸으니까내가누구보다 못생겨? 그러나우진은분위기를풀생각이없는지별수롭지않게같은말을되풀이했다. “당신이마일리카라보다못생겼다고말했어요.” \\".....이봐요.” “한국에는이런말이있습니다. 눈에는눈이에는이.” \\"???\\" 표정을구긴마리아얼굴에물음표가뜨자우진이간단하게뜻을말했다. “대충당한대로갚아준다는뜻이죠.” \\".....\\" 마리아가아랫입술을살짝깨물었다. 성격으로는바로쏘아붙이고싶었지만, 이미사전에행한잘못이있기에억지로짜증을삭 히는중. 눈빛이강렬한그녀였지만강우진은여유롭게마리아에게손을내밀었고. -스윽. 이번엔스페인어가아닌, 모두가들을수있게영어로읊조렸다. “강우진입니다, 오늘잘부탁해요.” 주변의시선이있어선지우진을노려보던마리아는하는수없이그의손을잡았다. “ 네. 반가워요.” 잡은손을두어번간단히흔든강우진이먼저움직였다. 그뒤를따르는최성건과팀원들. 이어최성건이뒤쪽마리아를힐끔대 면서도우진에게물었고. “뭐야? 둘이스페인어로무슨얘길한거여? ” 포커페이스가진한강우진의대답은간결했다. “그냥서로외모칭찬했습니다.” \\"...칭찬이오간분위기가아닌것같았는데.” “그럴리가요. ” “그래? 흠- 아니! 그보다. 야우진아, 너스페인어는 대체언제.....\\" 뭔가를물으려던최성건은작게한숨을쉬며가짜미소를지었다. “아니, 아니다. 뭐어차피들어도기나막히겠지.” 그리고뒤쪽에선, 지금도강우진의뒷모습을째려보는마리아는. “짜증나.” 간만에패배감이젖어들었다. “대체어째서...스페인어를할줄아는건데?” 약30분 뒤. 예전에도와봤던, 현재는후보배우가아닌‘야수’ 역배우로서강우진이오디션에참여했다. 천장의수많은샹들리에, 여러문양 이새겨진기둥과화려한그림이박힌대리석바닥. 다시금경이로운세트연회장이그의눈에가득했다. 이미푸른빛연회복의의상인우진은많은외국인스탭들사이에있었다. 머리가반쯤벗겨진빌로트너감독과한창얘기중. “우진씨, 무리하실필요는없어요저번오디션에쳤던피아노곡을‘야수’의느낌으로만부탁합니다.” “예, 감독님.” “완곡을하진않을겁니다. 일단‘야수’ 와의투샷을먼저보고, 후에는‘미녀벨라’ 후보배우들의원샷을체크할예정이니까요.” 참고로오늘‘ 미녀벨라’ 역오디션에참여한강우진은무료봉사가아니었다. 당연히상응하는대가가있을것. 사전에최성건과 '월드디즈니픽쳐스’의협의가진행된후성사된그림. 그때. -스으. 연노란색의드레스를입은여배우가세트연회장에등장했다. 갈색에서금발로떨어지는머리를묶은마리아아르마스였다. 목에꽤커다란금빛목걸이를한그녀가나타나자, 우진과얘기하던빌로트너감독이마리아에게붙었다. 오디션관련설명을하기 위함이었고, 브리핑을듣는마리아는. \\".....\\" 연신강우진을힐끔댔다. 시선이느껴지긴했으나우진은무시했다. ‘좀쫄리나보지??' 후로10분뒤. 여러카메라와조명등이세팅완료됐고, 빌로트너감독과키스탭외의다수가제자리를찾아앉았다. 강우진도세 트연회장위에비치된금빛피아노로걸어갈때였다. “크흠!” 뒤쪽에서들리는헛기침. 딱딱한표정의우진이고개를돌렸다. 드레스의마리아가뒤에붙어약간새침한얼굴로말했다. 스페인 어였다. “아까는-” 와중마리아는속으로부글부글끓고있었다. ‘쯧, 상황이 왜이렇게된거야.” 그러나지금은일단엎어진물을닦는게먼저. “아까는미안했어요. 진심은아니었어요.” 강우진역시스페인어로낮게답했다. “괜찮아요, 진심인거아니까.” “네?” “하지만오디션엔크게영향이있진않을겁니다. 프로니까요.” 자기할말만하고성큼성큼걸어가는강우진. 그런그의뒷모습을멍- 하니보던마리아. 처음겪어보는취급이었다. 이어그녀는 느낄수 있었다. ‘뭐, 뭐저런미친놈이!' 강우진이또라이그이상이라는것을. 뭐가됐든오디션은우진의말대로문제없이진행됐다. -슥. ‘야수’ 또는강우진이금빛피아노에앉았고드레스의마리아는연회장중앙에섰다. 곧, 빌로트너감독의시작하라는사인이울 렸다. 금세연회장엔우진의피아노선율이퍼졌다. -♫♪ 오디션때에는‘왕자’부터시작이었지만지금은바로‘야수’의재질의거친연주. 이어서. “!!!\\" 마리아의눈이순간커졌다. 우진의피아노실력에놀란듯. 하지만이내. \\".....\\" 숨을고르던마리아가입을열었다. 피아노선율에맞춰노래를시작한것 퉁명스런평소목소리가변했다. 뭐랄까, 맑고청명하 달까? 그녀는이미연기를시작했다. 피아노치는강우진을‘야수’ 보듯하며어렵사리노래를이어간다. 이모습을모니터로응시하 는 빌로트너감독. 둘의싱크로율을판단하듯턱을쓸었다. ‘흠- 좋군.’ 역시대중들이‘미녀벨라’ 1순위로꼽은마리아는그림에잘어울렸고, 한참가만히서서노래를하던그녀가이번엔. -스으. 피아노선율에맞춰홀로춤을시작했다. 몇십분쯤흘렀을까? “컷.” 감독의신호에맞춰마리아의춤이멈췄다. 곧, 피아노위강우진은빠졌고그녀의단독연기차례. 우진은외국인스탭들사이에 껴서그녀의연기를지켜봤다. ‘잘하네.’ 역시괜히헐리웃탑배우에오른건아닌모양마리아의연기는흡입력이상당했다. 그렇게마리아아르마스의오디션이끝났다. 감독과스탭들에게인사하며세트연회장을빠져나가던그녀는. \\".....\\" 강우진과눈이마주쳤지만딱히리액션은없었다. 물론, 우진도마찬가지서로오묘한시선만주고받다가마리아가사라졌다. 이어10분후마리아의바통을이어받은것은. “안녕하세요-” 익숙한목소리인금발의여자였다. 가슴까지오는금발에파란눈. 마일리카라였다. 그녀는아까전마리아와는달리. “이것봐.” 강우진에게옅은미소를보이며매우살갑게대했다. “내가말했죠? 당신이내오디션의피아노를쳐줄거라고. 이미말했지만‘야수’ 역축하해요.” 단숨에풀어진분위기에우진은속으로‘ 역시’ 따위의안도를뱉으면서도. ‘마일리카라가찐이지!' 겉으로는컨셉질을증폭시켰다. “잘부탁합니다.” “내드레스는두번째로보는거죠? 나도잘부탁해요.” 마일리카라가연노란드레스를입고세트연회장에재차등장한건15분뒤였다. 강우진은진작에금빛피아노앞. 구도는직전 의마리아와같다. 피아노에앉은우진이연회장중앙에선카라를힐끔했다. 같은드레스임에도분위기가판이했다. ‘제대로금발이라그런가? 드레스가더잘어울리는거같은데.’ 이는모니터를응시하는빌로트너감독역시같았다. 분명, 마리아도괜찮았지만지금의마일리카라의자태는눈을떼기가힘들 었으니까. ‘몇배는더그림이잘어우러지는군. 외모나외형에서차이가나는게아니야, 이건그녀가가진특색. 에너지다.” 뭣보다. ‘강우진과의투샷역시.....' 모니터나현실이나세트연회장의두배우가찰떡이었다. 이게빌로트너감독의첫인상. 이윽고. “준비됐으면시작해도됩니다.” 감독의사인에맞춰푸른빛연회복의‘야수’ 강우진의피아노연주가다시시작됐고, ‘ 미녀벨라’ 연기에돌입한카라가우진을어 렵사리힐끔대며입을열었다.‘야수’의눈치를본것. -♫♪ 깔끔하지만카라의음정끝이미세하게떨렸다. 실수? 하지만이씬을모니터로목도한빌로트너감독의눈엔이곳은이미세트 연회장이아니었다. 싸늘함만이가득한‘야수’의진짜성이었다. '.....이런.' 빌로트너감독은지금‘야수와미녀’를감상하고있었다. 같은날늦은오후. 시간은금방녹았다. ‘ 미녀벨라’의오디션을마친강우진은어느새‘ 월드디즈니픽쳐스’ 에도착한상태였다. 물론, 빌로트너감 독도함께였다. 그리고강우진은다시금입이쩍벌어질정도의미팅내용을들어야했다. 계약서에명시될금액즉, 강우진의몸값 이었다. ‘미친!!!' 컨셉질덕에가까스로참았지만, 상상초월의돈이오가는상황은아직우진에겐낯설었다.‘그만한돈이세상에존재하기는하는 거냐??” 따위로속으로되물었지만, 눈앞에서진행되는협상은현실이었다. 미팅은2시간쯤걸렸다. 이번에모든것이확정되진않았지만많은것이조율됐고, 다음행선지는‘컬럼비아스튜디오’ 였다. 그야말로헐리웃에서동에 번쩍서에번쩍. 이동간에강우진은최성건이던지는일에관해여러픽스를내려야했다. “우진아‘제이미쇼’ 이후로섭외폭발한다, 폭발해.” 미국의언론사, 방송사외의수많은곳에서섭외가빗발쳤으니까심지어초거대너튜브채널에서도하지만모두소화하는건불 가능. ‘전부나갈필요도없고.’ 강우진은지금이미지소비를할필요는없다는판단을내렸다. 가만히있어도알아서빨아줄텐데굳이헐레벌떡뛰어다닐필요 는없지? 대강생각한것이지만정답에가까웠다. 현재외신에서강우진을다루는기사는연일폭발하는중이었다. 『LA TIME/강우진의 ‘야수’ 역확정소식에전세계언론이들썩』 『BBX/컬럼비아와디즈니의남자강우진, 호불호속세계대중들의폭발적관심』 『CNM/“욕은작품을본다음에해도괜찮다” 강우진의발언, 자신감인가자만인가?』 후로며칠뒤아침, 강우진의집에모인최성건과팀원들. 빵으로간단히식사를때우는와중꽁지머리최성건이펼쳤던다이어리 를 덮으며 말했고. “슬슬한국복귀각잡혔다.” 꽤길었던LA의스케줄이일단정리됨을뜻했다. 역시나근엄한우진이고개를끄덕일때였다. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 그의핸드폰이긴진동을뱉었다. 전화였고, 상대를보니마일리카라였다. 최성건에게양해를구한우진이핸드폰을귀에붙이며 목소리를깔았다. “네, 안녕하세요.” 반면, 핸드폰너머카라의음성은약간상기된상태였다. “응좋은아침이네요, ‘ 야수’ 씨 지금나는‘미녀벨라’로서전화한거예요.” 그리고같은시각,‘월드디즈니픽쳐스’의공식발표가있었다. 『CNM/‘ 야수’의강우진에이어‘ 미녀벨라’ 역발표한‘월드디즈니픽쳐스’,“ 미녀벨라는마일리카라”』 ‘야수와미녀’가완성된순간이었다. < 굉음(4) > 끝","completion":"< Loud Noise (4) > When Kang Woo-jin first saw Maria Armas, he was struck by a sense of wonder. It was Maria who appeared when Woo-jin had just arrived at the 'spt studio', a super-giant set of 50,000 pyeong. The first to react was Choi Seong-geon. \\"Oh- that actress over there.\\" Then, Kang Woo-jin's gaze landed on her. Of course, he didn't remember her name. She was definitely a Hollywood actress he knew, similar to Chris Hartnett. But one thing was for sure. 'Wow, she's insanely beautiful. She has a unique aura too.' The aura she exuded was definitely luxurious. Especially, her bronze-colored eyes were impressive. Soon, Choi Seong-geon mentioned her name. \\"Do you know that actress? Maria Armas. She's one of the candidates for the role of 'Beauty Bella' along with Miley Cara. If you look at the atmosphere, she's often compared to Miley Cara.\\" Maria Armas? Honestly, even after hearing it, it wasn't a name that immediately clicked. Anyway, Kang Woo-jin pretended to know her in a low tone. \\"Yes, I've seen her.\\" \\"She may not be as openly active as a singer like Cara, but in Hollywood, she's famous for her singing ability. She's also good at musicals, and in terms of looks, she's on par with Miley, or so they say.\\" \\".....\\" Kang Woo-jin closely observed Maria's face from a few steps away. Both actresses mentioned were beyond beautiful, but there was no need to compare them. It was a different kind of beauty, or so thought Kang Woo-jin. At this point, Choi Seong-geon tapped Woo-jin on the shoulder. \\"Let's go say hello.\\" And Kang Woo-jin heard it. \\"I don't like that guy.\\" Maria's own gossip about him in Spanish. The timing was so absurd that it was almost laughable. However, it was impossible for Choi Seong-geon to understand Spanish. \\"Huh- from English to suddenly Spanish? That's Spanish, right?\\" Only Woo-jin could understand the gossip she was making because he had picked up Spanish while reading (experiencing) 'Jurassic Land 4'. \\"He's a bit lacking to play 'The Beast'. No, rather than 'The Beast', he doesn't suit 'The Prince'. 'The Prince' should be more handsome.\\" See this? Isn't it infuriating? Does being pretty set the price? Kang Woo-jin's no-nonsense temperament began to rise. No, it was not a situation he could tolerate, neither in terms of his real personality nor in terms of keeping up appearances. Therefore, Kang Woo-jin shouted, naturally in Spanish. \\"You are less attractive than Miley Cara.\\" Maria Armas was taken aback by Kang Woo-jin, who was right in front of her. Her face twisted slightly. First of all, it was unexpected that this Korean actor could speak Spanish like a native. \\"What, what? Why can you speak Spanish?\\" This was not only surprising to her but also to the foreign staff and Choi Seong-geon present. '.....Spanish??!' Everyone looked at Woo-jin with widened eyes. Regardless, he remained indifferent, simply staring at Maria from a step away. At that moment, Maria furrowed her brows. \\"What did you just say?\\" It was in Spanish again, and she put her pride forward. She was a bit upset about being caught gossiping, but Kang Woo-jin, who had no intention of easing the atmosphere, repeated the same words nonchalantly. \\"I said you are less attractive than Miley Cara.\\" \\".....Hey.\\" \\"In Korea, there's a saying. 'An eye for an eye.'\\" \\"???\\" As Maria's face crumpled with confusion, Woo-jin simply explained the meaning. \\"It roughly means to pay back in kind.\\" \\".....\\" Maria bit her lower lip slightly. She wanted to snap back immediately, but she had to suppress her irritation because she had already done something wrong. Her eyes were intense, but Kang Woo-jin casually extended his hand to Maria. -Swish. This time, not in Spanish, but in English for everyone to hear, he murmured. \\"I'm Kang Woo-jin, looking forward to working with you today.\\" Perhaps because of the surrounding eyes, Maria, who had been glaring at Woo-jin, reluctantly took his hand. \\"Yes. Nice to meet you.\\" After shaking Woo-jin's hand a couple of times, he moved first, followed by Choi Seong-geon and the team members. Then, Choi Seong-geon glanced back at Maria and asked Woo-jin. \\"What was that? What were you two talking about in Spanish?\\" Kang Woo-jin's answer was concise. \\"We were just complimenting each other's looks.\\" \\"It didn't seem like a friendly atmosphere though.\\" \\"How could that be?\\" \\"Really? Hmm- No! More importantly. Hey Woo-jin, when did you...\\" Choi Seong-geon, who was about to ask something, sighed softly and forced a smile. \\"No, never mind. I'd probably be frustrated if I heard the answer anyway.\\" Meanwhile, Maria, who was still glaring at Kang Woo-jin's back, felt annoyed. \\"How come... why does he know Spanish?\\" About 30 minutes later. Kang Woo-jin, who had previously helped out and was now an actor for the role of 'The Beast', participated in the audition. The set ballroom was filled with numerous chandeliers, pillars engraved with various patterns, and marble floors inlaid with splendid paintings. Once again, the magnificent set ballroom filled his sight. Already dressed in a blue ballroom outfit, Woo-jin was among many foreign staff members. Talking with director Bill Rotner, whose hair was half undone. \\"Woo-jin, there's no need to overdo it. Just play the piano piece you did at the last audition with the feeling of 'The Beast'.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" \\"We won't do the full song. We'll first look at the two-shot with 'The Beast', and later check the one-shots of the 'Beauty Bella' candidates.\\" By the way, Kang Woo-jin's participation in today's 'Beauty Bella' audition was not for free service. There would certainly be a corresponding reward. The deal was made after discussions between Choi Seong-geon and 'World Disney Pictures'. Then. -Swish. An actress in a light yellow dress appeared on the set ballroom. It was Maria Armas, with her brown hair falling to blonde, tied up. As she appeared, director Bill Rotner, who had been talking with Woo-jin, approached Maria to explain the audition. Maria, listening to the briefing, kept glancing at Woo-jin. She felt his gaze but ignored it. 'She must be feeling nervous??' Ten minutes later. After several cameras and lights were set up, and most of the staff found their places, Woo-jin walked towards the golden piano on the set ballroom. \\"Ahem!\\" A cough came from behind. Woo-jin turned his head to see Maria in her dress, speaking with a slightly sullen face in Spanish. \\"I'm sorry about earlier-\\" Maria was still boiling inside. \\"Damn, how did it come to this?\\" But for now, it was more important to clean up the spilled water. \\"I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean it.\\" Woo-jin also replied in Spanish, in a low voice. \\"It's okay, I know it wasn't sincere.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"But it won't have much impact on the audition. Because we're professionals.\\" Saying only what he wanted to say, Woo-jin walked away briskly. Maria, who was staring blankly at his back, was not used to being treated this way. Then she felt it. 'What kind of crazy guy is he!' She realized that Kang Woo-jin was more than just a troublemaker. Regardless, the audition proceeded without a hitch, as Woo-jin had said. -Swish. 'The Beast', or Kang Woo-jin, sat at the golden piano, and Maria in her dress stood in the center of the ballroom. Soon, director Bill Rotner's signal to start rang out. Woo-jin's piano melody filled the ballroom. -♫♪ The audition started with 'The Prince', but now it was a rough performance of 'The Beast's' character. Then. \\"!!!\\" Maria's eyes widened momentarily, surprised by Woo-jin's piano skills. But soon. \\".....\\" Maria took a breath and began to sing along with the piano melody. Her usual blunt voice changed. How to describe it? Clear and pure? She had already started acting. She continued to sing with difficulty, looking at Woo-jin playing the piano as if he were 'The Beast'. Director Bill Rotner, watching the scene on the monitor, stroked his chin, judging their synchrony. \\"Hmm- good.\\" Indeed, Maria, who was the public's first choice for 'Beauty Bella', fit the picture well, and she, who had been standing still and singing, now began to dance alone to the piano melody. How long had it been, perhaps a few dozen minutes? \\"Cut.\\" The dance stopped at the director's signal. Soon, Woo-jin left the piano, and it was time for Maria's solo acting. Woo-jin joined the foreign staff to watch her performance. 'She's good.' She wasn't a top Hollywood actress for nothing. Maria's acting was quite captivating. That's how Maria Armas' audition ended. After greeting the director and staff, she left the set ballroom. \\".....\\" She caught Woo-jin's eye but didn't react. Of course, Woo-jin did the same, and they exchanged ambiguous glances before Maria disappeared. Ten minutes later, the baton was passed to someone else. \\"Hello-\\" A familiar voice, a blonde woman. With hair down to her chest and blue eyes, it was Miley Cara. Unlike Maria before her, she... \\"Look at this.\\" She greeted Woo-jin with a light smile and was very friendly. \\"I told you, didn't I? That you would play the piano for my audition. I've already said it, but congratulations on the role of 'The Beast'.\\" With the atmosphere relaxed in an instant, Woo-jin internally breathed a sigh of relief, thinking 'as expected', but on the outside, he amplified his act. \\"Thank you. I look forward to working with you.\\" \\"I've seen your dress twice now, right? I look forward to working with you too.\\" It was 15 minutes later when Miley Cara reappeared in the set ballroom wearing a light yellow dress. Woo-jin had long been in front of the golden piano. The setup was the same as with Maria before. Woo-jin, sitting at the piano, glanced at Cara standing in the center of the ballroom. Despite wearing the same dress, the atmosphere was completely different. 'Is it because she's a true blonde? The dress seems to suit her better.' Director Bill Rotner, watching the monitor, felt the same. Certainly, Maria was fine, but the figure of Miley Cara now was hard to take your eyes off. \\"She fits the picture several times better. It's not just about looks or physique, it's her unique character. Her energy.\\" Above all. 'The two-shot with Kang Woo-jin...' Both actors in the set ballroom were a perfect match, whether on the monitor or in reality. This was director Bill Rotner's first impression. Soon. \\"If you're ready, you can start.\\" At the director's signal, the piano performance of 'The Beast' Kang Woo-jin, dressed in blue, began again, and Cara, who had entered the role of 'Beauty Bella', glanced at Woo-jin and began to sing. She was cautious of 'The Beast's' gaze. -♫♪ Her pitch was clean, but the end of Cara's notes trembled slightly. A mistake? But to director Bill Rotner, who was watching the scene on the monitor, this place was no longer the set ballroom. It was the real castle of 'The Beast', filled with coldness. '.....This.' Director Bill Rotner was watching 'The Beast and the Beauty'. The same late afternoon. Time melted away quickly. Kang Woo-jin, who had finished the 'Beauty Bella' audition, had already arrived at 'World Disney Pictures'. Of course, director Bill Rotner was with him. And once again, Woo-jin had to listen to the staggering details of the meeting. The amount specified in the contract, in other words, Kang Woo-jin's value. 'Insane!!!' He barely held back due to his act, but the situation with unimaginable amounts of money was still unfamiliar to Woo-jin. He wondered internally, 'Does such money even exist in the world??' But the negotiation happening before his eyes was real. The meeting took about 2 hours. Not everything was finalized this time, but a lot was coordinated, and the next destination was 'Columbia Studio'. It was truly a whirlwind tour of Hollywood. During the move, Kang Woo-jin had to make several picks regarding the offers Choi Seong-geon threw at him. \\"Woo-jin, after 'The Jamie Show', the offers are exploding, exploding.\\" There were countless invitations from American media, broadcasters, and even huge YouTube channels, but it was impossible to attend them all. 'There's no need to go to all of them.' Kang Woo-jin decided there was no need to consume his image right now. Why rush around when they would naturally seek him out? It was a rough thought, but it was close to the right answer. Currently, foreign media articles about Kang Woo-jin were exploding. \\"LA TIME/Kang Woo-jin's confirmation as 'The Beast' stirs up the global media\\" \\"BBX/Kang Woo-jin, the man of Columbia and Disney, explosive interest from the global public amidst mixed opinions\\" \\"CNM/'It's okay to criticize after watching the work,' says Kang Woo-jin, is it confidence or arrogance?\\" A few days later in the morning, Choi Seong-geon and the team members gathered at Kang Woo-jin's house. While having a simple breakfast with bread, Choi Seong-geon closed the diary he had been looking through and said. \\"It's about time to plan our return to Korea.\\" It meant that the lengthy LA schedule was coming to an end.

Woo-jin had received an award the first year the 'Acting Grand Prize' was established at the festival, and given his tremendous influence, it was a natural progression. His influence was so significant that the 'Acting Grand Prize' was even referred to as the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize'. However, Kang Woo-jin had been declining the festival's invitations. There wasn't a significant reason; it was simply because he was too busy. This year was no different. An invitation had arrived around the time Woo-jin left for LA, but since he wasn't sure how his Hollywood schedule would turn out, he had politely declined once again. Yet, Kang Woo-jin suddenly appeared at the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival'. No one knew about it. To be precise, no one knew that Woo-jin was currently in Korea. Including the domestic media and public opinion. It was natural. Kang Woo-jin had entered Korea very secretly, with the biggest concern being the potential accidents caused by reporters and fans at the airport. Regardless, no one knew that Kang Woo-jin had returned to Korea. A lightning-like appearance. Although he had previously declined, fortunately, his return to Korea coincided well with the festival schedule. When Kang Woo-jin arrived at the back of the festival hall, \\".....\\" His face was cynical, but inside he was moved, with a bit of fussing as a bonus. \\"Wow - it's been a while since Mise-en-scène! It feels like just yesterday I received my first acting award here, and that was already several years ago.\\" Unaware of this, Choi Seong-geon with a ponytail behind Woo-jin placed a hand on his shoulder and said, \\"Feeling nostalgic? You received the 'Acting Grand Prize' here and even connected with Director Kyota. Remember?\\" \\"Yes, Mr. Representative.\\" How could he forget? It was also the first day he had showcased his Japanese language skills. Moreover, top actress Hong Hye-yeon had won the Best Acting Award, and Kang Woo-jin's Grand Prize had caused a stir in the country. \\"Ha, you've heard, right? The 'Acting Grand Prize' here is now called the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize'.\\" The 'Kang Woo-jin Prize'. Woo-jin was aware of it too. All the rookie actors were desperate to win it. The more Kang Woo-jin thrived, the more valuable the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' became. \\"It's a trickle-down effect. Your name has such influence that the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' also continues to grow in impact. Mise-en-scène is actually famous for discovering new directors, but since the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' was established, it has become a significant gateway for rookie actors.\\" Last year's rookie actor who received the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' also became a hot topic, and now, thanks to that momentum, they are doing better than other rookie actors. Of course, that rookie actor is also working hard not to tarnish the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize'. A virtuous cycle, perhaps? Soon, Choi Seong-geon moved next to Woo-jin and spoke again. \\"But this year's 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' recipient is a blockbuster. It's already a high-profile award with the media and the entire entertainment industry, but today, Kang Woo-jin himself will present it, right? Moreover, it's his first schedule after returning from Hollywood. If I were an actor, I'd cry, I really would.\\" It was an accurate judgment. With the current situation, the focus would be several times higher than usual. Even a rookie actor who had lived in obscurity would receive unprecedented attention. Woo-jin thought it was unlikely. 'Would they really cry? More importantly - it's strange that the award bears my name.' Then. -Swish. Woo-jin, dressed in a suit, stepped onto the stage. It wasn't a huge stage, but the hundreds of people gathered in front were quite a crowd. The host, who suddenly saw Woo-jin up close, opened his mouth slightly and involuntarily let out an exclamation. \\"Wow - the real Kang Woo-jin.\\" It wasn't the feeling of seeing a celebrity; it was more like witnessing a legendary creature. Such was the proof of Kang Woo-jin's global influence. Regardless, Woo-jin. \\"......\\" Nonchalantly made eye contact with the host. He was asking for the microphone. The host, who had been startled, stuttered and handed him the microphone. Woo-jin, holding the microphone, turned his gaze to the front. The audience was filled with many big names, top actors, and rookie directors and actors. 'Ah, Director Kwon Ki-taek. It's been a while. Square jaw. Oh, Director Shin Dong-chun too.' The big names were generally close acquaintances of Woo-jin. However, all of them had their eyes wide open. They didn't expect Woo-jin to appear. Above all, the most extreme reactions came from the rookie directors and actors. They showed a variety of responses as if they had seen a ghost. Some looked at Woo-jin with a dumbfounded expression, others were flustered and shouted his name, and many were busy exclaiming \\"Wow\\" or \\"Whoa\\". One thing was certain. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woo-jin.\\" Everyone was looking up at Woo-jin, who had just casually greeted them all. At this point, the amiable Director Kwon Ki-taek in the front row of the audience chuckled. 'He must have entered Korea without anyone knowing, but his first move after returning is Mise-en-scène - does he care about memories after all, despite his cold exterior? Anyway, it's hard to read him.' Director Shin Dong-chun with a square jaw waved at Kang Woo-jin with a pleased expression. And then. \\"Holy, Kang Woo-jin??!\\" The dozen or so reporters positioned at the back of the hall went into a frenzy. \\"Why is Kang Woo-jin here??!! Wasn't he in Hollywood?\\" \\"That's not the issue right now!! Move! If you don't want to take pictures, don't block the way!\\" \\"Hey, hey - don't push!\\" \\"Wow - he turns Hollywood upside down and immediately gives the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' upon returning to Korea??! The actor receiving this year's 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' has hit the jackpot!\\" It was understandable for them to react this way since 'world star' Kang Woo-jin had suddenly appeared. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapak! The flash of cameras, which had been somewhat silent until now, suddenly became so frequent it could drive one insane. In the midst of this. \\"...I know everyone's been waiting, so I'll announce it right away.\\" On stage, Kang Woo-jin, thick with his act, spoke into the microphone and called out the name of this year's 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' rookie actor. He added a bit of playfulness to the announcement, which was otherwise too serious. \\"The 'Kang Woo-jin Prize'. No, the 'Acting Grand Prize'. Congratulations, actress Seo Ji-won.\\" He deliberately mentioned the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' in the announcement, and as soon as the name was called, an actress seated in the middle of the audience jumped up and screamed. \\"Kyaaak!! How! Me??!! Really?!\\" As if she couldn't believe it, the actress who was bouncing around in shock received several congratulations and rushed onto the stage. She wasn't very tall, but she was an actress with a charming mask. What was interesting was the change in her demeanor once she got on stage. Her tension had been sky-high until just before, but as soon as she approached Woo-jin on stage, she froze. \\".....Ah, uh. Wow - senior. It's so surreal... no, thank you so much.\\" Woo-jin looked at her calmly, but inside he was putting in effort. 'She's too excited, should I calm her down?' Woo-jin, who had thought this, offered a handshake to the actress before giving her the trophy and conveyed a simple message. \\"See you on set.\\" A very simple and casual tone. It was an encouragement to work hard and meet someday, but the rookie actress called Seo Ji-won. \\".....What?? With me at the, the set - Huhuh! Huhuk!\\" She suddenly began to cry a storm on stage. Kang Woo-jin maintained his poker face, but inside. \\".....\\" He was openly confused. 'Why?! Why is she crying??! Did I say something wrong??' Afterward. The rookie actress, who had been sobbing, finally calmed down, and the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' trophy was handed to her. However, to her, Kang Woo-jin in front of her seemed more glorious than the trophy itself. After many awards were presented, this year's 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival' came to an end. However, Kang Woo-jin did not leave immediately but fulfilled the scheduled photo time. \\"Mr. Kang Woo-jin!! Mr. Kang Woo-jin!\\" \\"Over here! Please look this way!!\\" \\"Can you make a heart with your hands, please!!!\\" From group to individual shots and more. After taking photos at least 20 times, Kang Woo-jin briefly conversed with the rookie actress who had received the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' that day. \\"Me! Me! I'll really work hard, senior! So I can act with you on set!\\" \\"Yes, see you then.\\" \\"Thank you!\\" He also had short conversations about recent events with domestic big-name directors like Kwon Ki-taek, Shin Dong-chun, and Kim Do-hee. Amidst this, the flash of cameras aimed at Woo-jin was relentless, and hundreds of rookie directors and actors were also busy taking photos of him with their phones. Of course, there were many requests for autographs. Originally, he should have left according to his schedule, but Kang Woo-jin stayed for about an hour. As soon as Kang Woo-jin got into the black van after managing to wrap things up. 'Phew - that was quite intense.' He let out a long sigh internally. The van started moving. Choi Seong-geon and the team members were noisy. It had been a while since they were in Korea, and the first move upon return was quite novel. The destination of the van carrying Kang Woo-jin was his house in Samseong-dong. In fact, Woo-jin had arrived in Korea just this morning, so he needed to rest. Precisely, he was given about 3 days off. Although his schedule was packed with Hollywood, Korea, Japan, and more, Kang Woo-jin needed some rest. Choi Seong-geon had recommended a week, but Woo-jin shortened it to 3 days. He arrived home in the late afternoon. \\"Ha - how long has it been since I've been home.\\" Kang Woo-jin immediately shed his act. Instead of unpacking, he threw himself onto the bed first. \\"Puhah!!\\" Although the private jet was comfortable, perhaps due to accumulated fatigue, Woo-jin quickly. \\".....\\" Fell asleep. However, Korea was not as quiet as Kang Woo-jin. \\"[Star Photo] 'World Star' Kang Woo-jin Suddenly Appears at the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival'/ Photos\\" \\"Wasn't he in Hollywood?

Of course, the 'Mise-en-scène Short Film Festival' and the 'Kang Woo-jin Prize' were also included in the articles. The mere fact that Kang Woo-jin had returned to Korea caused a stir. The news even quickly spread to Japan. \\"Japan Covers Kang Woo-jin's Return to Korea as Main News, 'The Prince Has Returned'\\" 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours. Naturally, even as Kang Woo-jin fell into a dead sleep in the early morning, this explosive atmosphere continued. -Holy!!! Kang Woo-jin is back??? Suddenly?? -Wow~~ Kang Woo-jin is so romanticㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ He went straight to the place where he first received an award upon his return -Honestly, Kang Woo-jin is now a true world starooo -This guy is seriouslyㅋㅋㅋ He never does anything quietlyㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -He's got style....

It really doesn't suit him.... -Here comes another idiot -Kang Woo-jin is seriously crazy, that's what you call a star, he definitely has a unique aura -A Korean actor as the lead in a Hollywood movie... it's majestic... . . . Around 1 AM, when Kang Woo-jin instinctively snapped his eyes open. \\"Ugh - why are there so many messages?\\" Kang Woo-jin was everywhere in South Korea. Meanwhile, in LA. While it was early morning in Korea, it was just past 1 PM in LA. The whole of the US, including LA, was still buzzing from the recent 'Beauty and the Beast' news, and the issue of 'Beneficial Evil' had gained even more attention in the meantime. Foreign media were openly covering Woo-jin's secret return to Korea with such interest. At this point, in a meeting room at the giant 'Columbia Studio' in LA, several foreigners and an old Korean man were wrapping up a conversation. The old Korean was Director Ahn Ga-bok of the movie 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. \\"Then, I'm counting on you, Chris.\\" Director Ahn Ga-bok had just shaken hands with the handsome Hollywood top actor with deep brown eyes who smiled. \\"I, for one, will try to deliver a performance that contributes to the work and the 'Cinematic Universe', Director.\\" It was Chris Hartnett. After Chris and his team left the meeting room, the female producer of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' let out a small sigh. \\"Phew - Chris Hartnett is confirmed too. Still, I didn't expect Chris to covet a role other than the lead.\\" The other foreigners nodded in agreement. Amidst this, Director Ahn Ga-bok, with a deeply wrinkled face and different thoughts from the foreigners, glanced at the tablet. -Swish. He murmured softly while looking at the projected schedule.

Le texte doit faire environ une page word.","completion":"Martin O’Hagan était un journaliste nord-irlandais réputé pour son travail courageux dans le domaine du journalisme d'investigation. Né en 1950 à Lurgan, en Irlande du Nord, il a exercé sa profession dans un contexte historique complexe, marqué par le conflit nord-irlandais, souvent appelé \\"Les Troubles\\". O’Hagan travaillait pour le « Sunday World », un journal connu pour ses enquêtes approfondies sur les activités criminelles et les affaires de paramilitarisme en Irlande du Nord. Son rôle en tant que journaliste consistait à exposer la vérité sur les violences perpétrées des deux côtés du conflit, en dévoilant notamment les liens entre les groupes paramilitaires et le narcotrafic, ainsi que la corruption au sein des institutions. Cependant, le travail de O’Hagan a mis sa vie en danger. Le 28 septembre 2001, il a été assassiné près de son domicile à Lurgan par des inconnus, alors qu'il rentrait à pied d’un pub avec sa femme. Il est devenu le premier journaliste à être tué en raison de son travail en Irlande du Nord depuis le début des Troubles. Son assassinat a soulevé plusieurs problématiques dans la société nord-irlandaise et au-delà. Tout d'abord, cela a souligné les risques importants que courent les journalistes d'investigation dans les zones de conflit interne. De plus, la mort de O’Hagan a montré les difficultés et les obstacles rencontrés dans la lutte contre les groupes paramilitaires, et la peur qu'ils instillaient dans la société pour maintenir leur emprise. Enfin, l'échec à traduire en justice les responsables de cet acte (les enquêtes n’ayant jamais abouti à une condamnation définitive) a mis en lumière les failles du système judiciaire et les défis de la réconciliation et de la paix dans une région longtemps divisée par la violence sectaire. En conclusion, Martin O’Hagan était un journaliste dédié, dont le travail et la mort tragique continuent d’être un symbole des pressions et dangers auxquels sont confrontés les journalistes d'investigation dans des régions en conflit. Son assassinat n'a pas seulement été une perte pour sa famille et ses collègues, mais une attaque contre la liberté de la presse et le droit d'informer, éléments essentiels à toute société démocratique. Cet événement tragique continue d'interroger sur la capacité des sociétés à protéger leurs journalistes et à garantir la justice pour ceux qui sont victimes en raison de leur engagement pour la vérité."},{"prompt":"un tout petit peu plus long stp","completion":"Martin O’Hagan était un journaliste nord-irlandais reconnu et respecté pour son engagement dans le journalisme d'investigation, courageux et tenace, prenant place au cœur de l'un des conflits les plus prolongés et les plus violents d'Europe : le conflit nord-irlandais, communément appelé \\"Les Troubles\\". Né en 1950 à Lurgan, une ville marquée par les tensions entre communautés protestantes unionistes et catholiques nationalistes, O’Hagan a très vite développé une ardeur pour révéler les vérités difficiles qui se cachaient derrière les façades des groupes paramilitaires et des réseaux criminels. Employé par le « Sunday World », un journal fameux pour ses prises de position audacieuses et ses reportages investigatifs, Martin O'Hagan a bravé de nombreux dangers pour exposer les activités illicites telles que le trafic de drogues, les meurtres et la corruption. Il n'a pas hésité à pointer du doigt des figures de l’ombre, ni à dénoncer les actes criminels commis tant par les républicains que les loyalistes, souvent sous couvert d'actions politiques ou militantes. Cette quête de vérité lui valut de nombreux ennemis et il devint une cible. Le 28 septembre 2001, le tragique se concrétisa lorsqu'il fut assassiné par des hommes armés près de chez lui, laissant derrière lui une famille et une communauté journalistique en deuil, ainsi qu'une société nord-irlandaise en émoi. Son décès a marqué un tournant sombre, ravivant la conscience des dangers auxquels sont exposés les journalistes se confrontant aux puissances corrompues et violentes. Le meurtre de Martin O'Hagan a suscité une série de questionnements cruciaux quant à la liberté de presse, la sécurité des journalistes et l’impunité des criminels. Il illustre la vulnérabilité des reporters d'investigation, particulièrement dans les zones de conflits, où la vérité est souvent une menace pour les parties en lutte pour le pouvoir. Il met aussi en exergue les difficultés du processus de paix en Irlande du Nord, où les réminiscences du passé violent peuvent soudainement ressurgir et frapper en pleine ère de reconstruction. De plus, l'enquête sur l'assassinat de O'Hagan et l'absence de condamnations significatives ont révélé des insuffisances dans le système judiciaire et les mécanismes de protection des citoyens, renforçant le cynisme vis-à-vis de l'état de droit. C'est une illustration poignante du long chemin restant à parcourir vers la justice et l'équité, défis majeurs pour les sociétés cherchant à se rétablir après une période de conflit interne. En somme, Martin O'Hagan laisse derrière lui un héritage de détermination et d'intégrité journalistique, son nom étant synonyme de la lutte contre la censure par l'intimidation et la violence. Son travail reste une source d'inspiration pour de nombreux journalistes, tandis que son meurtre prône comme un rappel impératif de la nécessité de protéger la liberté de presse et d'assurer des mécanismes de justice efficaces pour ceux qui risquent leur vie au nom de l'information et de la vérité."},{"prompt":"maintenant traduit le texte en anglais en utilisant des mots très simples, niveau B1. Il faut que ça soit un anglais parlé donc pas de connecteurs style however etc, des \\"so\\" suffiront","completion":"Martin O'Hagan was a journalist from Northern Ireland. He was famous for his brave work in finding out hidden truths. He was born in 1950 in a place called Lurgan. This place had many problems between two groups: the Protestants who wanted to stay with Britain, and the Catholics who wanted to be part of Ireland. He worked for a newspaper named \\"Sunday World\\". This newspaper liked to tell people about secret and bad stuff that was happening, like crime and illegal groups. Martin wasn't scared to talk about these things. He wrote about drug dealing, killings, and people in power doing wrong things. He believed in telling the truth, no matter how dangerous it was. But telling the truth was risky. On September 28, 2001, bad people with guns killed him close to his home when he was walking back from a pub with his wife. It was a very sad time for everyone who knew him. He was the first journalist to be killed like this in Northern Ireland since the troubles started. Martin's death made people ask a lot of big questions. For example, can journalists do their job safely, especially in places with lots of fighting? Also, why can bad people get away with hurting others? His death showed that it’s hard to protect people who try to find out the truth, and even harder to make sure that the bad guys get punished. The police tried to find out who killed Martin, but they didn't put anyone in jail for it. This made a lot of people think that the law wasn't strong enough and that it was too easy for criminals to stay free. It made it clear that places trying to move on after a lot of fighting still have a lot of work to do to make things fair and safe. In short, Martin O'Hagan will always be remembered as a journalist who was not afraid to speak the truth. His death reminds us that we need to protect the people who tell us the news and make sure that the laws work well to protect everyone.

Et par un matin clair, tous décidèrent d'unir Leurs forces et leurs voix, pour pouvoir résister. Artisans, boulangers, et même les fromagers, Rejoignirent les rangs, d'un mouvement engagé. Ils criaient haut et fort, d'une seule passion, Pour la terre, pour l'art, contre toute oppression. Mais loin, très loin de là, dans les bureaux dorés, L'Union Européenne, un peu trop irritée, Envoya ses émissaires pour mettre fin à la fête, Ordonna au gouvernement: \\"Tout cela, il faut l'arrêter!\\" \\"Vous irez les forcer, avec vos casques bleus, Vos boucliers robustes, vos cordons soyeux.

Одной из причин роста количества пар, заключающих брачный договор в РФ, может быть повышение статуса и значимости правового обеспечения семейных отношений. Брачный договор является инструментом, который позволяет установить права и обязанности супругов в браке, а также регулировать вопросы имущественного характера. В условиях растущей экономической неопределенности и увеличения числа разводов, пары могут предпочесть заключить брачный договор для защиты своих интересов и снижения рисков. Кроме того, повышение осведомленности населения о возможностях и преимуществах брачного договора также может способствовать его увеличению. 2. Мера 1: Введение государственной программы поддержки молодых семей. Предоставление материальной помощи и льгот молодым семьям может существенно облегчить их финансовое положение и повысить уровень жизни. Это может включать в себя выплаты по рождению и воспитанию детей, льготные ипотечные кредиты или субсидии на жилье, снижение налогооблагаемой базы для молодых семей и т.д. Это позволит молодым семьям чувствовать себя более уверенно в будущем, иметь стабильность и мотивацию для создания семьи и рождения детей. Мера 2: Развитие системы поддержки семьи и материнства. Создание и развитие сети центров социальной помощи семье, молодым и будущим родителям может способствовать укреплению и улучшению семейных отношений. Эти центры могут предлагать семейную терапию, консультации по воспитанию детей, поддержку и сопровождение молодых семей в период беременности и послеродового периода, а также предоставлять информацию о доступных для семьи государственных и общественных программ и льгот. 3. В частном случае моего региона, такой информации нет доступной в интернете. 4. Тренд изменения среднего возраста матери при рождении первого ребенка после 1994 года может быть связан с несколькими факторами. Во-первых, стандарты образования и карьерного развития изменились, и многие женщины предпочитают закончить высшее образование и начать карьеру перед тем, как становиться матерями. Во-вторых, изменения в социальном окружении и уровне жизни также могут влиять на решение о рождении первого ребенка. Высокие расходы на уход за ребенком, нестабильная экономическая ситуация, отсутствие поддержки со стороны государства и общества могут становиться преградами для раннего рождения детей. В-третьих, изменение социокультурных норм и ценностей также может играть роль в сдвиге среднего возраста матери при рождении первого ребенка. С изменением ролей и возможностей женщин, карьерных ожиданий и требований к индивидуальной свободе, они могут откладывать материнство до более позднего возраста. 5. Мера 1: Расширение сети детских садов и предоставление бесплатного или льготного доступа к детским учреждениям. Это может помочь снизить финансовую нагрузку на многодетные семьи, позволив родителям работать или заниматься самореализацией, а детям получать качественное образование и развитие. Это также поможет укрепить здоровье и социальные навыки детей, увеличить их успешность в будущем. Достоинство: Увеличение доступности детских садов поможет снизить финансовые барьеры для многодетных семей и создать равные возможности для детей разных социальных групп. Недостаток: Расширение сети детских садов и предоставление большего количества мест может потребовать значительных инвестиций со стороны государства. Мера 2: Введение налоговых льгот и пособий для многодетных семей. Возможность получать налоговые льготы или пособия может существенно улучшить материальное положение многодетных семей и облегчить их финансовую нагрузку. Это может включать в себя снижение налоговых ставок, предоставление дополнительных пособий по уходу за детьми, а также возможность получения дополнительных льгот и скидок на медицинские и образовательные услуги. Достоинство: Налоговые льготы и пособия могут значительно снизить финансовые затраты многодетных семей и создать стимул для увеличения рождаемости.

However, I can guide you through the necessary steps to begin creating simple animations on your OLED display. First, ensure you have the following: 1. Arduino Uno. 2. 0.96\\" OLED Display (usually these are I2C with SSD1306 controller). 3. Connections/wires. 4. SSD1306 display library (such as Adafruit_SSD1306). Below is a starting point, using the Adafruit_SSD1306 library. This code is not for Gangnam Style dancing, which would require a large number of custom bitmaps, but instead, it'll show you how to animate a simple shape across your OLED screen. \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64 #define OLED_RESET -1 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET); void setup() { if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C)) { for (;;); } display.display(); delay(2000); // Pause for 2 seconds display.clearDisplay(); } void loop() { // Simple Animation for(int i=0; i<SCREEN_WIDTH; i++) { display.clearDisplay(); display.fillCircle(i, SCREEN_HEIGHT/2, 10); display.display(); delay(10); // this delay controls the speed of the animation } } \`\`\` Follow these steps: 1. Include the necessary libraries for controlling the OLED display. 2. Define the screen width, height, and I2C address of your OLED display. 3. Create a \`setup()\` function to initialize your display. 4. Create a \`loop()\` function to run your animation. In the given code, it moves a circle from left to right. 5. Install the Adafruit_SSD1306 and Adafruit_GFX libraries using the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE if you do not have them. For a full Gangnam Style animation: - Draw each frame of the dancing character in a sprite sheet. - Convert each frame to a format readable by the Arduino (e.g., a bitmap array). - Store these frames in program memory (PROGMEM) if they are large. - Display each frame in a timed sequence to create the illusion of animation. You'd also need to minimize the number of frames due to the limited memory of the Arduino Uno. It might be helpful to store the frames on an external memory device, like a SPI flash memory chip, and read the frames into the Arduino as needed. However, given the complexity and required memory, a more suitable approach might be to use a microcontroller with more memory and processing power, such as an ESP32 or a Raspberry Pi Pico, if you are set on this animation."},{"prompt":"write a code of gangnam style dancing animation for 0.96\\" oled display with arduino uno complete code with complex dancing","completion":"Creating a complex Gangnam Style dancing animation on a 0.96\\" OLED display using an Arduino Uno involves multiple complex steps. However, I can provide you with an outline of the process, but implementing a full, complex dance animation is beyond the scope of this platform because it involves creating numerous frames and handling considerable resource constraints. Here's an outline of what you would need to do if you were to attempt this yourself: 1. **Create or obtain frames**: You would need to create or source individual bitmap frames that represent your animation. These frames would be drawn pixel by pixel or with a drawing program capable of creating monochrome bitmaps. Each frame needs to be sized to match the resolution of your OLED, which is likely 128x64 pixels. 2. **Convert frames to byte arrays**: Each frame will need to be converted to arrays of bytes that can be written to the OLED. An online converter tool can translate bitmap images to byte arrays formatted for Arduino. 3. **Optimize storage**: The Arduino Uno has only 2KB of SRAM and 32KB of flash memory, so a long animation could quickly overfill the available memory. The PROGMEM keyword could be used to store the data in flash memory. 4. **Program the frame sequence**: You would write code that cycles through these frames in sequence to create the animation effect. Due to the complexity of a full animation and the limitations of the Arduino, it's likely not practical to animate a full Gangnam Style dance on an Uno. Instead, you might animate a very limited sequence or a simplified representation of the dance. For the sake of example, I'll provide you with some pseudo-code, not a full working code, demonstrating how you might approach the looping of frames: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #define OLED_RESET -1 Adafruit_SSD1306 display(128, 64, &Wire, OLED_RESET); const uint8_t PROGMEM frame1[] = {...}; // Frame 1 byte array const uint8_t PROGMEM frame2[] = {...}; // Frame 2 byte array // ... More frames ... void setup() { display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C); } void loop() { displayFrame(frame1); // Display frame 1 delay(100); // Frame duration displayFrame(frame2); // Display frame 2 delay(100); // Frame duration // ... Display more frames } void displayFrame(const uint8_t frame[]) { display.clearDisplay(); for (int i = 0; i < display.height() / 8; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < display.width(); j++) { // Draw each byte of the frame display.drawPixel(j, i * 8, pgm_read_byte_near(frame + i * display.width() + j)); } } display.display(); } \`\`\` The frames used in the \`displayFrame\` function need to be created, converted to the byte array format, and placed in the program. Due to the potential for consuming too much memory, you may need to use only a few frames and loop through them, simplifying the animation greatly. This entire process requires significant manual preparation, and respect for the memory constraints of the Arduino Uno. To create a detailed and smooth animation, you would likely need a more capable microcontroller, more memory capacity, or an external storage device from which to stream the frames."},{"prompt":"Compilation error: stray '342' in program","completion":"The compilation error \`stray '342' in program\` indicates that there is an invisible or non-standard character somewhere in your code that the compiler doesn't understand. This kind of error often occurs when copying and pasting code from a web page that includes non-standard characters or special formatting. To fix this error, follow these steps: 1. **Check for Non-ASCII Characters:** Carefully look through your code and remove any non-ASCII characters. Pay special attention to quotation marks, apostrophes, and any other non-standard text characters. 2. **Rewrite the Code Manually:** If you can’t easily find the problematic characters, try retyping sections of your code by hand instead of copying and pasting. 3. **Clear Formatting:** Use a plain text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS) to paste your code and then remove any formatting. After this, copy and paste back into the Arduino IDE. 4. **Start with a Clean File:** If the first three steps don't work, create a new sketch file in the Arduino IDE and manually type in your code rather than copying and pasting. 5. **Search for Invisible Characters:** Sometimes, invisible characters can be introduced into the code. You can use an editor that shows all characters, like Notepad++ with the \\"Show All Characters\\" option or any other capable code editor. 6. **Check for Common Mistakes:** Make sure you are not using fancy quotation marks like “ or ”. All quotation marks in your code should be the straight \\" character. Also, check for any stray backticks or other unusual characters. Please also ensure that for the template code provided earlier, you replace the placeholder arrays \`{...}\` with actual byte data for the frames, otherwise, it will not compile. If the code isn't compiling due to a simple stray character error, simply removing or retyping the line where the error is reported usually resolves the issue."},{"prompt":"code without bug","completion":"Creating a full Gangnam Style dancing animation is a complex task that requires a lot of manual work in creating and converting each frame of the animation to a bitmap format that the Arduino can handle. Due to constraints such as memory limitations, you will need external storage like an SD card to hold your bitmap frames, as well as a more advanced approach for managing and displaying your animations. Here's a simplified example of how to animate a bitmap image on an OLED display using an Arduino. This demonstration will only show you how to animate a static bitmap image, which could act as a single frame of your dance animation. You'll need to create and store each frame of your Gangnam Style dance similarly, which may not be feasible given the Uno's memory constraints. Firstly, make sure you have the \`Adafruit_SSD1306\` and \`Adafruit_GFX\` libraries installed in your Arduino IDE. Here's example code to animate a static bitmap image moving across an OLED: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64 #define OLED_RESET -1 #define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3C // ADD or change depending on OLED I2C address Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET); // Sample bitmap of a simple smiley face (replace with a frame of your animation) #define bitmap_width 8 #define bitmap_height 8 static const unsigned char PROGMEM bitmap_data[] = { 0b00111100, 0b01000010, 0b10100101, 0b10000001, 0b10100101, 0b10011001, 0b01000010, 0b00111100 }; void setup() { if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, SCREEN_ADDRESS)) { for (;;); // Don't proceed, loop forever } display.display(); delay(2000); // Pause for 2 seconds display.clearDisplay(); display.display(); } void loop() { int16_t x = 0; // Starting position on the X axis int16_t y = (SCREEN_HEIGHT - bitmap_height) / 2; // Center the image on the Y axis for (x = -bitmap_width; x < SCREEN_WIDTH; x++) { // Loop to slide bitmap across screen display.clearDisplay(); display.drawBitmap(x, y, bitmap_data, bitmap_width, bitmap_height, SSD1306_WHITE); display.display(); delay(10); // Delay to control animation speed } } \`\`\` This code creates a moving smiley face across the screen. To create a frame-by-frame Gangnam Style animation, you would have to design each frame of the dance individually as a bitmap, convert them into byte arrays, and replace the \`bitmap_data\` above, as well as adjust \`bitmap_width\` and \`bitmap_height\` accordingly. Remember, due to the memory limits of the Arduino Uno, you might have to use an SD card to store all the frame data. This would mean adding SD card reading functionality to your code, which would considerably increase the complexity of your project. A complex dance animation typically requires dozens to hundreds of frames which would be impossible to store directly on an Arduino Uno. This is why this simplified example is provided as a conceptual guide rather than a practical implementation for a full animation."},{"prompt":"u just write code for showing time of dhaka in oled 0.96\\" and arduino no extra module","completion":"To display the current time for Dhaka on a 0.96\\" OLED display using an Arduino Uno, without any extra Real-Time Clock (RTC) modules, you can do the following: 1. Use the Arduino's \`millis()\` timer function to keep track of time. However, keep in mind the Arduino's clock isn't very accurate, so it will drift over time. 2. You'll need to manually set the time every time the Arduino restarts or resets. Here is some basic example code displaying a fixed time that you should update manually: \`\`\`cpp #include <Wire.h> #include <Adafruit_GFX.h> #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h> #define SCREEN_WIDTH 128 #define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64 #define OLED_RESET -1 #define SCREEN_ADDRESS 0x3C // Add your display's I2C address here Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET); // Initial time at start-up; you should set this to the current UTC time plus the offset for Dhaka int hours = 12; // Set to the current UTC+6 hours int minutes = 0; // Set to the current minutes int seconds = 0; // Set to the current seconds unsigned long previousMillis = 0; void setup() { if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, SCREEN_ADDRESS)) { for (;;); } display.display(); delay(2000); display.clearDisplay(); } void loop() { unsigned long currentMillis = millis(); // Update the time every 1000 milliseconds if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= 1000) { previousMillis = currentMillis; seconds++; if (seconds >= 60) { seconds = 0; minutes++; if (minutes >= 60) { minutes = 0; hours++; if (hours >= 24) { hours = 0; } } } displayTime(hours, minutes, seconds); } } void displayTime(int h, int m, int s) { display.clearDisplay(); display.setTextSize(1); display.setTextColor(SSD1306_WHITE); display.setCursor(0, 10); if (h < 10) display.print('0'); display.print(h); display.print(':'); if (m < 10) display.print('0'); display.print(m); display.print(':'); if (s < 10) display.print('0'); display.print(s); display.display(); } \`\`\` This code initializes the time at the current Dhaka time and then increments the seconds, minutes, and hours accordingly. Since there's no synchronization with an accurate time source, you'll need to reset the \`hours\`, \`minutes\`, and \`seconds\` variables to the current Dhaka time when the Arduino resets or if the time needs syncing due to drifting. If you want to maintain accurate time over long periods, consider obtaining a Real-Time Clock module like the DS3231 and using it to keep track of time even when the Arduino power cycles."},{"prompt":"Un monde post singularité comment sa serait pour nous il aura des nouvelles technologies chaque jour","completion":"La singularité technologique est une hypothèse selon laquelle l'avancement technologique atteindra un point où il y aura une croissance exponentielle incontrôlable et imprévisible.

В данной ситуации формируется прямоугольный треугольник, в котором: - Перпендикуляр от точки до плоскости является катетом треугольника и равен 12. - Наклонная является гипотенузой треугольника и равна 13. - Проекция наклонной на плоскость является другим катетом, и её мы и хотим найти. По теореме Пифагора, сумма квадратов катетов равна квадрату гипотенузы, то есть: a² + b² = c², где a и b – катеты (в нашем случае перпендикуляр и проекция), а c – гипотенуза (наклонная). Мы знаем, что c = 13 и a = 12. Подставляем эти значения в формулу и находим проекцию b: 12² + b² = 13² 144 + b² = 169 b² = 169 - 144 b² = 25 Теперь извлечем квадратный корень из обеих частей уравнения, чтобы найти b: b = √25 b = 5 Таким образом, проекция наклонной на плоскость равна 5 единицам."},{"prompt":"Из точки А к пл. альфа проведены перпендикуляр и наклонная, угол между которыми равен 30. Перпендикуляр равен 3. Найти проекцию","completion":"Если угол между перпендикуляром и наклонной равен 30 градусам, то можно использовать свойства прямоугольного треугольника, в котором один из углов - острый угол 30 градусов, а другой соответственно 60 градусов, так как сумма углов в треугольнике равна 180 градусов, а один из углов прямой (90 градусов). В таком треугольнике: - Катет, лежащий против угла в 30 градусов, равен половине гипотенузы. - Катет, лежащий против угла в 60 градусов, равен корню из трёх делённому на два от длины гипотенузы. Для дальнейших расчётов предположим, что длина наклонной (гипотенузы) - это x, а перпендикуляр, который является катетом против угла в 60 градусов, равен 3. Проекцией наклонной на плоскость является катет, лежащий против угла в 30 градусов. Мы хотим его найти, обозначим его как P. Исходя из свойств прямоугольного треугольника: P = x/2 Для нашего случая, где угол между перпендикуляром и наклонной — 30 градусов, перпендикуляр (высота) будет равен P*√3, так как он лежит против угла в 60 градусов: 3 = P√3 Теперь находим P: P = 3 / √3 P = 3√3 / 3 (удалим знаменатель, умножив и числитель, и знаменатель на √3) P = √3 Тогда проекция наклонной на плоскость равна √3, что приблизительно равно 1,73 (если округлить до двух знаков после запятой)."},{"prompt":"Из точки А к пл. альфа проведены перпендикуляр и наклонная, угол между которыми равен 60. Перпендикуляр равен 5. Найти проекцию","completion":"Для нахождения проекции наклонной на плоскость, когда известны длина перпендикуляра и угол между перпендикуляром и наклонной, можно использовать тригонометрические функции. Обозначим: - d — длину перпендикуляра (в данном случае 5), - l — длину проекции наклонной на плоскость, которую мы хотим найти, - α — угол между перпендикуляром и наклонной (в данном случае 60 градусов). Длина проекции наклонной l будет равна прилежащему катету прямоугольного треугольника, образованного проекцией, перпендикуляром и наклонной.

Wind Energy: Certain areas in Limpopo have favorable wind conditions, making wind energy a potential option for power generation. Wind turbines can be installed to harness the wind’s kinetic energy and convert it into electricity.","completion":"To determine the wind speed in specific areas of Limpopo Province, detailed wind resource assessments would need to be conducted. These assessments involve collecting data on wind speed, direction, and other atmospheric conditions over an extended period. Generally, wind speeds in South Africa can vary significantly depending on the specific location and topography. The average wind speed in Limpopo Province is estimated to range between 4 to 7 meters per second (m/s) at a height of 10 meters above the ground. However, it's essential to note that wind speed can vary throughout the province, and some areas may have higher or lower wind speeds. When evaluating the viability of wind energy, a wind speed of at least 5 to 6 m/s is typically considered ideal for commercial-scale wind turbines. This is because higher wind speeds enable turbines to produce more electricity efficiently. However, the suitability of wind energy in a particular location is not solely dependent on wind speed. Other factors such as wind turbulence, wind direction, land availability, environmental considerations, and grid connection feasibility also play a role in assessing the overall sustainability of wind energy projects.

The \`millis()\` function can be used to track time while the Arduino is running, but it will reset when the power is cycled or when the Arduino is reset. Moreover, \`millis()\` is not accurate over long periods due to the crystal oscillator's precision on the Arduino board. For a simple demonstration, I will show you how to display the time elapsed since the Arduino was reset or powered on. This example will use the U8g2 library for driving the OLED display. First, you need to install the U8g2 library in the Arduino IDE. You can install this from the Library Manager (\`Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries...\`) by searching for \\"U8g2\\" and installing it. Once the U8g2 library is installed, you can use the following example code: \`\`\`cpp #include <U8g2lib.h> // Set up the display // The exact constructor will depend on the type of your OLED and its communication protocol (SPI or I2C) // You might need to tweak these parameters based on your display's specific requirements. U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C display(U8G2_R0, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); void setup() { // Initialize the display display.begin(); } void loop() { // Calculate the time since the Arduino started unsigned long time_now = millis(); unsigned long hours = (time_now / (1000UL * 60 * 60)) % 24; // Convert to hours unsigned long minutes = (time_now / (1000UL * 60)) % 60; // Convert to minutes unsigned long seconds = (time_now / 1000UL) % 60; // Convert to seconds // Prepare buffers to hold the time components as strings char buffer_hours[3]; char buffer_minutes[3]; char buffer_seconds[3]; // Format the time components as strings with leading zeros if necessary sprintf(buffer_hours, \\"%02lu\\", hours); sprintf(buffer_minutes, \\"%02lu\\", minutes); sprintf(buffer_seconds, \\"%02lu\\", seconds); // Clear the display buffer display.clearBuffer(); // Set the font for displaying the time display.setFont(u8g2_font_ncenB08_tr); // Create the string to display String timeString = String(buffer_hours) + \\":\\" + String(buffer_minutes) + \\":\\" + String(buffer_seconds); // Draw the string on the display buffer display.drawStr(0, 24, timeString.c_str()); // Send the display buffer to the display display.sendBuffer(); // A small delay to avoid updating the display too frequently delay(1000); } void drawTimeOnDisplay() { // Calculate time elapsed since the Arduino was reset } \`\`\` In this example, replace the constructor for U8G2 with the one that matches your OLED screen and its communication protocol. If you are unsure about the constructor, refer to the U8g2 library documentation and examples for guidance on finding the right one. The code above will keep 'running' time; however, remember that it won't be accurate and will reset if power is lost or the Arduino is restarted. For a persistent and accurate timekeeping solution without the internet, you really would need a Real-Time Clock module or some form of manual input to set the time. Additionally, without some kind of time signal or manual adjustment, you also cannot account for changes in the time zone or Daylight Saving Time adjustments."},{"prompt":"u write code for showing dancing animation that u make in oled 0.96\\" in arduino","completion":"Creating a dancing animation on an OLED 0.96\\" display using an Arduino requires creating a sequence of bitmap images that represent each frame of the animation. The U8g2 library can be used to display these frames. First, you will need to generate or obtain the bitmap frames. Each frame will be a monochrome bitmap that fits the resolution of your screen (typically 128x64 pixels for a 0.96\\" OLED). Here's a simplified example of how you might implement a \\"dancing\\" animation with just two frames. For a more detailed and smooth animation, you would need more frames and corresponding code to display them in sequence. **Note**: This example assumes you have the frames defined as byte arrays in XBM format. First, define the frames as byte arrays: \`\`\`cpp // Frame 1 static const unsigned char frame1_bits[] U8X8_PROGMEM = { // Bitmap for frame 1... (This should be the actual byte array for the first frame.) }; // Frame 2 static const unsigned char frame2_bits[] U8X8_PROGMEM = { // Bitmap for frame 2... (This should be the actual byte array for the second frame.) }; \`\`\` Modify the following code template to define an animation. You must replace the \`U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C\` constructor and \`frame1_bits\` and \`frame2_bits\` with the actual bitmap data for your animation frames. \`\`\`cpp #include <Arduino.h> #include <U8g2lib.h> // Set up the display (choose the right constructor for your display) U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C oled(U8G2_R0, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); // Placeholder frames (replace these with your own bitmaps) static const unsigned char frame1_bits[] U8X8_PROGMEM = { /* Replace with frame 1 bitmap data */ }; static const unsigned char frame2_bits[] U8X8_PROGMEM = { /* Replace with frame 2 bitmap data */ }; void setup() { oled.begin(); } void loop() { // Frame 1 oled.clearBuffer(); oled.drawXBMP(0, 0, 128, 64, frame1_bits); oled.sendBuffer(); delay(500); // Delay between frames // Frame 2 oled.clearBuffer(); oled.drawXBMP(0, 0, 128, 64, frame2_bits); oled.sendBuffer(); delay(500); // Delay between frames } \`\`\` Remember to replace the placeholder bitmaps with the actual image data. You can create these bitmaps in an image editor and convert them to XBM format with a converter tool. There are online tools available for converting images to XBM format suitable for use on these displays. Keep in mind that this is a simple example, and for a smoother animation, you'd use more frames. This example only implements two frames and toggles between them for illustrative purposes."},{"prompt":"show there my name JAMMESOP in defferrent style at least 100","completion":"Generating 100 different styles for displaying text on a 0.96\\" OLED display with an Arduino is beyond the practical scope here, as it would require creating or adapting 100 different fonts or manually designing 100 different custom graphics for the name \\"JAMMESOP\\". However, I can show you how to display your name in a few different styles using the U8g2 library's built-in fonts. Keep in mind that the small resolution of the display and the limited number of fonts in the U8g2 library will restrict the number of unique styles you can create. Here is an example code snippet showcasing how to display \\"JAMMESOP\\" in different font styles using an Arduino and a 0.96\\" OLED display: \`\`\`cpp #include <Arduino.h> #include <U8g2lib.h> // Initialize the OLED display (make sure to use the correct constructor for your display) U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C oled(U8G2_R0, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); void setup() { oled.begin(); // Initialize the display } void loop() { // Array of fonts const uint8_t* fonts[] = { u8g2_font_ncenB08_tr, // Example font 1 u8g2_font_ncenB10_tr, // Example font 2 u8g2_font_ncenB12_tr, // Example font 3 u8g2_font_ncenB14_tr, // Example font 4 // Add more font styles as needed }; // Loop through the fonts and display \\"JAMMESOP\\" for (auto font : fonts) { oled.clearBuffer(); // Clear the buffer oled.setFont(font); // Set the current font oled.drawStr(0, 24, \\"JAMMESOP\\"); // Draw the text at position (0, 24) oled.sendBuffer(); // Transfer buffer to the display delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds before showing the next style } // Wait a bit before looping again delay(5000); } \`\`\` Due to the space limitations of the display and the limited number of built-in fonts in the U8g2 library, this example shows only a few styles. To achieve 100 different styles, you'd need to include additional fonts (which may involve adding them to the library if they aren't already available), or you could design custom characters for various styles, but both options go beyond the practicality of a simple code snippet. It's worth noting that an Arduino has limited memory, so it might not be possible to include 100 different fonts or custom-designed character sets due to memory constraints. For a wide variety of styles, you'd typically look into more powerful hardware or platforms that can handle a large set of fonts or graphics."},{"prompt":"u write code for showing there my name JAMMESOP in defferrent style at least 100 that u make in oled 0.96\\" in arduino .dont make it random make it beautiful","completion":"Creating 100 different beautiful and handcrafted styles for displaying the name \\"JAMMESOP\\" on a 0.96\\" OLED display using an Arduino is a complex design task that goes beyond a simple code implementation and would typically involve a graphic designer. Arduino devices also have limited memory, making it impractical to store 100 different custom-designed fonts or graphics. However, I can illustrate a simpler approach by showing you how to display your name with a few selected fonts, how to add simple effects like scrolling text, and how to use variations like uppercase, lowercase, and italics. Here's a basic example showcasing different representations, but keep in mind that the variety is limited by the constraints of the Arduino and OLED display: \`\`\`cpp #include <Arduino.h> #include <U8g2lib.h> // Initialize the OLED display (make sure to use the correct constructor for your display) U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C oled(U8G2_R0, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); void setup() { oled.begin(); // Initialize the display } void loop() { // Array of fonts const uint8_t* fonts[] = { u8g2_font_ncenB08_tr, // Bold font u8g2_font_ncenB10_tr, // Larger bold font u8g2_font_profont11_tr, // Monospaced font u8g2_font_helvB08_tr, // Helvetica font u8g2_font_logisoso16_tr, // Tall font // Add more built-in font styles as needed, up to the memory limit }; // Display \\"JAMMESOP\\" using different fonts for (auto font : fonts) { displayText(font, \\"JAMMESOP\\"); } // Example of scrolling text effect scrollingText(u8g2_font_ncenB08_tr, \\"JAMMESOP\\"); } void displayText(const uint8_t* font, const char* text) { oled.clearBuffer(); // Clear the buffer oled.setFont(font); // Set the current font oled.drawStr(0, 24, text); // Draw the text at position (0, 24) oled.sendBuffer(); // Transfer buffer to the display delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds before showing the next style } void scrollingText(const uint8_t* font, const char* text) { oled.setFont(font); int width = oled.getUTF8Width(text); // Get the pixel width of the text for (int x = 128; x >= -width; x--) { oled.clearBuffer(); // Clear the buffer oled.drawUTF8(x, 24, text); // Draw the text starting at (x, 24) oled.sendBuffer(); // Transfer buffer to the display delay(25); // Delay between movements to control scroll speed } delay(1000); // Wait before the next effect } \`\`\` To truly create 100 different styles, you would need to: 1. Design multiple bitmap images of the name \\"JAMMESOP\\" with unique styling. 2. Manually convert each design into a format suitable for the OLED display (such as XBM or byte arrays). 3. Write code to display each design, perhaps with different effects like fading, scrolling, blinking, etc. The manual creation and conversion process is time-consuming and might exceed the storage capacity of most Arduino boards. Advanced animation effects may also severely impact performance due to the limited processing power and RAM of standard Arduino boards. For such an extensive project, you might consider using a more powerful microcontroller with larger memory, more advanced graphics libraries, and displays that can support more intricate designs and transitions."},{"prompt":"u write code for showing there my name JAMMESOP in defferrent style at least 10 that u make in oled 0.96\\" in arduino .showing in 3d in x y z cordinates","completion":"Displaying text in 3D on an OLED 0.96\\" display with an Arduino is a bit complex due to the display's monochrome and 2D nature. We can simulate a 3D effect by using perspective tricks, but these will be limited to simple transformations due to the computational constraints of the Arduino. Firstly, let's clarify what is meant by \\"3D effect.\\" Since the OLED is a 2D display, we can only give the illusion of 3D by drawing the text in such a way that it appears to have depth, such as by skewing or scaling the text, or making it appear as though it's disappearing into the background. To demonstrate a basic 3D effect with text, you need to: 1. Create a function that transforms the x and y coordinates of the text to simulate depth perception. 2. Cycle through different \\"styles,\\" which essentially will be different positions or transformation states of the text. Given an actual 3D coordinate system (x, y, z), we might simulate the 3D effect through scaling the size of text, where \`z\` influences the size (text gets smaller as 'z' increases, simulating depth). Here's a basic example that demonstrates how you might scale text to create a rudimentary 3D effect using the U8g2 library. Due to the complexity of true 3D transformations on limited hardware, this example will only demonstrate a very simple scaling effect: \`\`\`cpp #include <Arduino.h> #include <U8g2lib.h> // Initialize the OLED display (make sure to use the correct constructor for your display) U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C oled(U8G2_R0, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE); void setup() { oled.begin(); // Initialize the display } void loop() { int zPositions[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Simulated 'z' positions const uint8_t* fonts[] = { u8g2_font_helvB08_tr, // Base font u8g2_font_helvB12_tr, u8g2_font_helvB14_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso16_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso18_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso20_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso24_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso26_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso28_tr, u8g2_font_logisoso32_tr, }; for (int z = 0; z < sizeof(zPositions) / sizeof(zPositions[0]); z++) { displayText3DEffect(fonts[z], \\"JAMMESOP\\", zPositions[z]); } } void displayText3DEffect(const uint8_t* font, const char* text, int zPosition) { oled.clearBuffer(); // Clear the buffer oled.setFont(font); // Set the current font // Pretend that the zPosition scales the text int offsetX = (zPosition - 1) * 5; // Offset for x to simulate movement int offsetY = (zPosition - 1) * 2; // Offset for y to simulate movement int offsetFontSize = zPosition; // Offset for font size to simulate depth // \\"Draw\\" the text on the buffer oled.drawStr(offsetX, 24 + offsetY, text); // Draw the text at position (offsetX, 24+offsetY) oled.sendBuffer(); // Transfer buffer to the display delay(1000); // Wait for a bit before the next scale } \`\`\` This example has a few problems. Primarily, it doesn't really simulate a true 3D effect, it just cycles through text at different sizes and positions. We are severely limited by the constraints of the display and Arduino memory. A true 3D transformation could be implemented in software, but it would be complex and be more of an academic exercise rather than something practical for an Arduino and a simple display. For more sophisticated effects, you would either need to do drawing at the pixel level or have a pre-generated set of images displaying different perspectives of a 3D-rendered text which you cycle through to create an animated effect. Given the limitations of Arduino hardware and the display's capabilities, true 3D text rendering is beyond the scope of these devices."},{"prompt":"اعلان عن شقه في الحي التالت عند مسجد الروضه فيو جاردن متميز بحري مباااشر مساحه 175متر نص تشطيب","completion":"شقة للبيع في الحي التالت بجوار مسجد الروضة، تمتاز بإطلالة رائعة على حديقة خاصة. المساحة الكلية للشقة تبلغ 175 متر مربع وهي نصف تشطيب. تتكون الشقة من غرفتي نوم واسعتين، وحمامين، ومطبخ مفتوح على الصالة، وريسبشن كبير يتسع للأثاث بكل راحة. تتمتع الشقة بتصميم عصري ومناسب لجميع الأذواق وتضم مساحات مريحة لتلبية احتياجاتك اليومية. الشقة موجودة في برج سكني مرموق ومجهز بمصعد، ويتمتع بموقع مميز في الحي الثالث بالقرب من خدمات الحي والمواصلات. لمزيد من المعلومات ولتحديد موعد لزيارة الشقة، الرجاء التواصل على الرقم التالي: [رقم الهاتف]."},{"prompt":"public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { /* * Crea un programa que analice texto y obtenga: * - Número total de palabras. * - Longitud media de las palabras. * - Número de oraciones del texto. */ System.out.println(\\"nPalabras - Oraciones - Longitud media\\"); Analizador.unicoBucle(\\"Cuando los jugadores se hayan ido, cuando el tiempo los haya consumido, ciertamente no habrá cesado el rito.

Establishing a definitive hierarchical order of effectiveness for these interventions is challenging because individual responses to these interventions can vary and depend on various factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and current stress levels. Research on these interventions varies, with some having more evidence to support their effectiveness than others. Moreover, combining these activities can sometimes have synergistic effects. For example, regular aerobic exercise combined with adequate sleep and stress reduction techniques (like meditation) may more effectively lower cortisol levels than any of these interventions alone. To truly rank these interventions, controlled studies and meta-analyses would be required to compare their effects directly. Such comparisons may not always be feasible due to ethical, practical, or methodological reasons.

However, I can attempt to arrange the list based on general understandings and the weight of evidence found in scientific literature, while keeping in mind that individual studies may show varying results. 1. **Regular Sleep**: Quality sleep has consistently been shown to maintain healthy cortisol rhythms and levels and is foundational to stress management. 2. **Aerobic Exercise**: Regular moderate aerobic exercise is well-supported by research for effectively reducing cortisol levels over time. 3. **Meditation**: Numerous studies support the stress-reducing effects of various forms of meditation, which can help lower cortisol levels. 4. **High-Intensity Exercise (HIIT)**: HIIT can improve stress resilience. However, because HIIT initially raises cortisol levels, its long-term effects on baseline cortisol can vary. 5. **Laughter**: Laughter can decrease stress hormones and improve mood, making it effective for stress reduction, though fewer studies may have directly measured its impact on cortisol compared to interventions like exercise or meditation. 6. **Use of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**: While SSRIs primarily treat depression and anxiety, the reduction in stress may indirectly lower cortisol levels. 7. **DHEA Supplementation**: Evidence about DHEA's effectiveness is mixed, and due to its hormonal nature, it should be used carefully and typically under physician supervision. 8. **Melatonin Supplementation**: Like DHEA, melatonin supplementation can be beneficial for sleep and may indirectly affect cortisol; however, its direct impact on cortisol may be less established. 9. **Pet and Affection**: Positive social interactions and pet interactions are known to reduce stress. However, assessing their quantitative effect on cortisol may not be as thoroughly researched as other interventions. 10. **Relax in Nature**: Time in nature, or \\"forest bathing,\\" has been linked to lowered cortisol levels, with numerous studies suggesting benefits, though this is an emerging area of research. 11. **Take a Warm/Cold Shower**: The evidence for showers affecting cortisol is mostly anecdotal or based on the general relaxing or invigorating effects of bathing. Cold showers might activate the body's stress response with potential long-term adaptation benefits. 12. **Listen to Music**: Listening to music can be relaxing and thus may lower cortisol levels. However, the effect might depend on the type of music and personal preferences. 13. **Listen to the Sounds of Nature**: Natural sounds can be calming, similar to relaxing music, but direct evidence for cortisol reduction might be limited. 14. **Bowing 108 Times in Buddhism**: This is a specific religious practice that may help to reduce stress through its meditative aspects, but its direct effects on cortisol might not have been as extensively studied as other more general practices. Please note, this ordered list is a simplified approximation and does not represent a definitive or exhaustive ranking.

Please list them from the top down, starting with the ones that raise the most cortisol.","completion":"Cortisol is a hormone that is often elevated in response to stress and some other conditions. Various factors can contribute to increasing cortisol levels. Here's a list starting with those most typically associated with higher elevations in cortisol: 1. **Chronic Stress**: Prolonged psychological or physical stress is one of the primary causes of sustained high cortisol levels. 2. **Acute Stress**: Intense short-term stress can lead to a significant but temporary spike in cortisol. 3. **Caffeine Consumption**: High doses of caffeine can acutely increase cortisol levels. 4. **Overtraining Syndrome**: Excessive physical training without adequate rest can chronically elevate cortisol. 5. **Sleep Deprivation**: Lack of sleep is strongly associated with increased cortisol levels, especially when chronic. 6. **Stimulant Use**: The use of stimulant drugs can raise cortisol levels due to their stress-mimicking effects. 7. **Poor Diet**: Diets high in sugar and refined carbohydrates can lead to fluctuations and increases in cortisol. 8. **Severe Trauma or Injury**: Physical trauma or injury can trigger a significant stress response, raising cortisol. 9. **Infection or Illness**: The body's immune response to illness or infection often results in elevated cortisol levels. 10. **Surgery**: Surgical procedures trigger a significant stress response due to both psychological stress and physical trauma. 11. **Low Blood Sugar (Hypoglycemia)**: Cortisol is part of the body's response to low blood sugar, acting to raise blood glucose levels. 12. **Alcohol Intoxication and Withdrawal**: Alcohol can disrupt normal cortisol cycles, and withdrawal can cause a spike in cortisol. 13. **Certain Medications**: Some medications, such as oral contraceptives or glucocorticoids, can raise cortisol levels. 14. **Environmental and Noise Pollution**: Chronic exposure to loud noise or toxic environments may contribute to elevated cortisol. 15. **Psychological Disorders**: Conditions like depression and anxiety disorders are often associated with dysregulated cortisol levels, sometimes leading to increases. It's important to note that this list outlines general causes and may not apply to every individual in the same way. Also, while acute rises in cortisol from some of these sources can be normal or even healthy responses to certain stimuli or challenges, chronic elevation of cortisol can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Individual responses to these factors can vary significantly depending on genetics, lifestyle, and overall health. Cortisol naturally fluctuates throughout the day, with levels typically higher in the morning upon waking and lower at night."},{"prompt":"Can frequent fasting lead to chronically high levels of the hormone cortisol?","completion":"Frequent fasting or intermittent fasting can have complex effects on cortisol levels and the body's stress response. Cortisol is a hormone that, among other functions, is involved in glucose metabolism and energy balance. It is released during periods of fasting to aid in the maintenance of blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and breaking down tissue. In some cases, particularly with prolonged or frequent fasting that is not well-managed, cortisol levels can rise. This is likely a biological response to what the body perceives as a stressor (in this case, a lack of food intake). The increase in cortisol can help mobilize energy stores to provide the body with needed glucose during times of fasting. However, fasting-induced changes in cortisol can be complex: 1. **Individual Variation**: Different individuals may experience varying cortisol responses to fasting, influenced by factors such as genetics, overall health, nutritional status, and the specifics of one's fasting regimen. 2. **Type of Fasting**: The impact on cortisol will likely depend on the type of fasting (e.g., intermittent fasting with an 8-hour eating window, alternate-day fasting, or more prolonged fasts). 3. **Adaptation**: Over time, some individuals may adapt to a fasting routine, which can result in a more blunted cortisol response as the body becomes accustomed to the fasting periods. 4. **Coping with Stress**: How a person psychologically reacts to fasting can influence cortisol levels. If fasting is experienced as a significant and chronic stressor, it may lead to a persistent elevation in cortisol levels. 5. **Balance with Other Hormones**: Fasting can also influence other hormones, like insulin and ghrelin, that play a role in metabolism and may interact with cortisol. 6. **Overall Impact on Health Status**: If frequent fasting leads to improved health outcomes—for example, by reducing obesity or improving metabolic health—this may have a mitigating effect on cortisol's negative aspects. While short-term rises in cortisol during fasting are part of a normal adaptive response, chronic elevations due to frequent or prolonged fasting could potentially have negative health implications, including impaired immune function, decreased bone density, and adverse effects on mood and cognitive function. To summarize, frequent fasting can potentially lead to increased cortisol levels, particularly if the fasting is experienced as a form of chronic stress. It is vital for individuals to monitor their response to fasting and seek guidance from healthcare professionals, especially when considering more rigorous fasting regimens."},{"prompt":"If I eat only one meal a day, my body will recognize it as fasting and my cortisol hormone will be high, but if this goes on for months, I don't think I will release much cortisol anymore. Is this really true?","completion":"Eating only one meal a day is a form of intermittent fasting commonly referred to as OMAD (One Meal A Day). This dietary approach entails a significant restriction of the eating window, which can indeed initiate a stress response that includes the release of cortisol, especially during the initial adaptation phase. When you start an OMAD fasting schedule, your body may perceive the sudden change in energy intake as a significant stressor, potentially leading to the release of more cortisol to help manage glucose levels and maintain energy supply. However, individual responses can vary based on a multitude of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, existing health conditions, and the individual's psychological perception of the fasting regimen. Over time, as you mentioned, it is indeed possible for the body to adapt to the new eating pattern. This adaptation could result in a more regulated cortisol response. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which governs cortisol release, can adjust to repeated and predictable stressors. If your body learns to anticipate the regular eating schedule and adjusts metabolically, you might experience a more normalized cortisol pattern, mitigating the initial stress response. However, it's important to note that long-term adherence to such a restrictive fasting regimen may not be suitable for everyone and could potentially have negative health effects for some individuals. Persistent high cortisol levels can be deleterious to overall health, but the body's adaptation to stressors like fasting can sometimes mitigate this if the practice does not continuously activate a stress response. If you're considering or are already practising OMAD, it's vital to monitor how your body responds. Pay attention to signs of excessive stress, such as sleep disturbances, mood changes, or irregular menstrual cycles in women. These can be indicators that your body may not be adapting well to the fasting protocol. As with any significant dietary or lifestyle change, it is highly recommended to consult with a healthcare professional, especially for long-term practices. A healthcare provider can offer personalized advice and monitor any potential adverse effects or necessary adjustments to ensure you are fasting safely and sustainably."},{"prompt":"According to this script suggest 15 suitable image prompts.

Dolores Cannon said, “We’re all volunteers; we’re all here because we want to be, and we’re all here because we have a mission.” For spiritual healers, you have an extraordinary gift, so your mission may be to heal others. From empathic sensitivity to a profound connection with nature, each sign is a clue leading you deeper into the understanding of your unique role in the universe. By clicking on this video, the universe might be sending you a message. So, open your hearts, sharpen your intuition, and let’s explore the 10 clear signs you are a spiritual healer. If you’ve been through tough times, like really hard stuff, you might just have a superpower: being a healer. It’s not just about a broken heart; we’re talking heavy stuff, near-death scares, tough times, and even things like abuse. These experiences aren’t fun, but they can turn you into a healer. Here’s the deal: going through these hard things can make you crazy strong and super wise. It’s like you level up in life. Imagine a video game where you face tough challenges, and each time you beat one, you get stronger. That’s you, after surviving these situations. And get this, even when life gets really, really rough, you stay hopeful. It’s like having a secret weapon. You might not have a clear reason to be hopeful, but you just are. It’s this inner strength that helps you help others. You understand their struggles because you’ve been there. Think of it like this: going through hard times is like superhero training for healers. You learn about yourself, become crazy empathetic, and get a sneak peek into the energy world. It’s like turning your pain into power. And if you ever need a boost, chatting with another healer can help clear away any leftover negative vibes. So, surviving difficult situations – that’s your sign saying you’re on your way to being an amazing healer. Embarking on a journey through the shadows, facing a Dark Night of the Soul, could be a sign that you’re more than just a traveler in this world; you might be a healer, a seer, an archetype of the shaman. The shamanic path, deeply rooted in tradition, often involves a transformative ordeal, a dance with life’s most challenging moments. When life takes you to the brink, confronting trauma or a soul-shaking experience, it can be a pivotal moment. The shamanic archetype recognizes that those who have walked through the abyss return with more than scars; they carry a profound shift in perspective. Trauma, in its harrowing grip, can momentarily disconnect us from the body, opening the door to unseen energies and realms. It’s as if the boundaries of the self become more permeable, making one sensitive to the subtle energies that weave through existence. Near-death experiences, too, can be a bridge to the spirit realm, expanding perception upon the return to life. So, if you’ve weathered the storm of a Dark Night of the soul and emerged with heightened sensitivity and a broader understanding of life, you might embody the essence of a shaman. In the tapestry of healers and seers, your unique journey becomes a guiding light for others navigating their own shadows. Ever feel like big crowds and noisy places zap your energy? Well, if you’re a healer, you’re not alone. Hanging out in bustling places can be like an energy roller coaster for you. Imagine as if you’re in a crowded spot and suddenly it feels like you’ve absorbed everyone’s vibration. That’s because as a healer, you’re like an energy sponge in places with lots of people. It’s like getting bombarded with all sorts of feelings, some happy, some not so much. Now, here’s the thing: large crowds might leave you feeling not just tired but overwhelmed. It’s like your energy is being pulled in a million directions, and when that happens, you can start feeling off-kilter, like your energy shield is taking hits. Maybe you’ve noticed you feel quite sick or drained after going to the grocery store or a concert. That’s your healer mode sensing all the different vibes around. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a superpower. So, if you need a breather after a crowded day, that’s okay. Your home’s quiet comfort is like a recharge station for your amazing healing energy. If you find yourself happiest surrounded by trees, mountains, or the soothing sounds of the sea, congratulations, you might just be a natural-born healer. Nature is like your second home, a place where you feel completely at peace. Think about it — the openness of a field, the majestic view of a mountain, or the calming waves of the sea — these are your go-to spots. Nature isn’t just scenery for you; it’s like a friend. You sense the energy in the trees, mountains, and water, just like they have their own healing vibes, much like you do. Being a healer, you’re super sensitive, and nature is your secret weapon when life feels a bit too much. A walk in the woods or a moment by the ocean recharges your superpowers. It’s like nature, being a living thing, sends out this incredible healing energy, and when you’re there, you soak it all in. So, if you dream of a home with an open field view, facing a mountain, or the sea, away from the hustle and bustle, you’re not just daydreaming; you’re tuning into your healer instincts, finding strength in the beauty of the Great Outdoors. Being super sensitive isn’t just a personality trait; it might be a sign that you’re a natural-born healer. You’re like an emotional detective, picking up on things that others might miss, whether it’s hearing, seeing, smelling, or feeling, you’re tuned into a different frequency. You’re not just good at recognizing your own emotions; you can sense what others are feeling too. It’s like having a radar for emotions. Knowing if someone is happy, sad, or needs a helping hand, you’re the one who can say, “I’m here for you until you’re strong enough,” or “You’ll be okay, you’re stronger than you know,” because you can see the strength in others. In the world of healing, they call this being an empath. It’s not just about feeling your own feelings; you’re like a sponge for other people’s emotions and even their physical struggles. This sensitivity isn’t a weakness; it’s a superpower. It’s what helps you connect with others on a deep level and guides you in knowing who needs your healing touch. So, if you find yourself feeling a lot and understanding even more, you might just be on the healer’s path. Being a healer means your positivity isn’t just a mood lifter; it’s a transformative force. Everyone around you senses it; even in tough times, the air changes when you’re present. You’re like a beacon of light that brightens even the gloomiest room. Your energy has a magical touch; after being with you, people feel lighter, shedding the weight of their troubles. Your gift extends beyond words; your mere presence soothes and heals. You might not notice it, but others do. Your energy helps them release dense emotions, creating a sense of relief. Your wisdom is a source of healing too; people find comfort in your words, like you always know just what to say. People are drawn to you because in your presence, their burdens seem to vanish. Your pure and healing energy acts as a distraction from life’s negativity, helping them elevate their spirits. If you’re curious about consciously enhancing your healing abilities, consider connecting with an experienced healer. Guided by someone with expertise, you can learn safe techniques and navigate the path of conscious healing. Being a strong dreamer is like having a special ticket to the unseen realms where healing for the soul and mind unfolds. Dreams act as a portal, taking you on nightly adventures in the astral planes around our planet. These astral planes are a bit like a halfway point between the spiritual and the physical, a place where dreams become real events. If you find your dreams are vivid and lively, if you often share your nightly escapades with those close to you, and if you’ve encountered departed loved ones or spirit beings in your dreams, you’re showing signs of being a strong dreamer. Maybe you’ve even received messages in your dreams that guided you in waking life, or your dreams have offered glimpses into the future. Being a strong dreamer isn’t just about a good night’s sleep; it’s a connection to the spirit realm. Your dreams become a pathway to spirit, a source of healing, and a way to bring back insights that not only benefit you but can also be a source of healing for others. So if your dreams are more than just stories that play out during the night, consider it another sign that you’re a natural-born healer. If you can’t stand seeing others in pain, and you have an undeniable urge to help, you might just be a natural-born healer. This compassionate trait is often found in those with innate healing gifts. On a soul level, however, it’s crucial to navigate this strong desire to assist others wisely. Sometimes this drive to help can lead to challenges such as prioritizing others’ needs over your own, or falling into patterns of codependency in relationships. Natural-born healers may find themselves in situations where they consistently put their needs aside to aid others in their struggles. It’s essential to channel your healing gift appropriately, perhaps in a professional setting where your efforts are recognized. Bringing this desire to heal into personal relationships can sometimes create imbalances that aren’t sustainable. If strangers often open up to you about their personal lives unexpectedly, it’s a clear indication of your healing energy. People subconsciously sense your safe and comforting aura, making them feel drawn to share their emotions with you. While this is flattering, it’s important to set boundaries to avoid constantly depleting your energy. Remember, your healing energy has the power to attract those in need, like broken birds seeking solace. Balancing the art of helping others while preserving your own energy requires understanding when and how to establish healthy boundaries. As a healer, you possess a unique ability to perceive and comprehend the subtle energy that surrounds you. This energy can manifest in various forms, but you are most likely to observe it when you are in the presence of other individuals. For instance, when you walk into a room, you can instantly sense the energy that permeates the space without any context. Moreover, you possess a heightened sensitivity towards the energetic shifts that occur within people, animals, and places. This is because as a healer, you are exceptionally empathetic. You tend to absorb the emotions and feelings of others to an extent that it can be challenging to distinguish them from your own. For example, if you spend time with someone who is feeling sad, you may start to experience those same emotions yourself. However, this aspect of being a sensitive healer can also present significant challenges because you are so attuned to the feelings of others, you may feel a strong sense of responsibility to make them feel better. This can lead to people-pleasing tendencies and a heightened need for validation and approval from those around you. As a result, you may feel extra pressure to conform to other people’s expectations and make them like you, which can be exhausting and emotionally draining. As a healer, it is natural to require a lot of time alone. However, this can sometimes lead to long periods of isolation, which may not always be easy to deal with. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that time spent alone is an integral and sacred part of being a healer. It is during this time that you are regenerating your energy, allowing you to continue functioning in the world. This is especially true if your job requires you to spend a lot of time around other people, or if you are often out and about. Being around others can be draining because you have an invisible antenna that is continuously picking up on their frequencies. Always feeling the energy of others can get exhausting, and it is crucial to take some time to recharge your batteries. Spending time alone also allows you to reconnect with your inner guidance. When you’re in tune with your inner compass, you feel more in control of your day-to-day life. Being in this energy will help you know what to avoid and when to withdraw your energy. It will also help you to be more present in your interactions with others, as you will have a better sense of boundaries and how to maintain your own energy while also being present for others. Ultimately, taking the time to be alone and recharge is an investment in yourself and your ability to be of service to others.

Макіавеллі видатним вченим?","completion":"Нікколо Макіавеллі, італійський дипломат, політичний мислитель, історик і письменник Ренесансу, зробив визначний вклад у розвиток політичної науки та сучасної політичної думки. Його заслуги привнесли певні інноваційні ідеї до політичної теорії. 1. Відокремлення політики від етики: У своєму найвідомішому творі \\"Государ\\" (Il Principe) Макіавеллі обґрунтував думку, що діяльність правителів має оцінюватися на основі їхньої ефективності та спроможності утримувати владу, а не виходячи із моральних чи етичних норм. Цей підхід став основою реалістичної школи у міжнародних відносинах. 2. Реалізм у політичній теорії: Макіавеллі вважається засновником політичного реалізму, який виходить із передумови, що правителі повинні керуватися раціональним аналізом, а не ідеалізмом, і повинні зосередитись на досягненні і збереженні влади. 3. Аналіз влади та державного управління: Макіавеллі надав ґрунтовний аналіз того, як влада працює і як її слід використовувати для ефективного управління державою. Його ідеї були важливі для розвитку сучасного поняття державності та суверенності. 4. Вивчення історії та її застосування до політики: Макіавеллі звертався до історичних прикладів, щоб пояснити свої політичні теорії. Це підхід вважається одним із перших систематичних спроб використовувати історичний аналіз для розуміння політичного процесу і постуртування загальних принципів політичного врядування. 5. Вплив на сучасну політичну думку: Макіавеллів вплив на політичну науку й сучасну політичну філософію є незаперечним. Його ідеї про владу, її збереження, маніпуляцію та конфлікт застосовуються у багатьох областях, включно з політикою, міжнародними відносинами, психологією та бізнесом. 6. Літературний внесок: \\"Государ\\" є лише однією з численних робіт Макіавеллі. Він також автор \\"Розмов про перших десять книг \\"Історії\\" Тита Лівія\\", \\"Мандрагола\\" та інших творів, які вивчають різні аспекти політичної влади та поведінки. Таке глибоке розуміння природи політичної влади й характеру політичного лідерства, яке Макіавеллі демонструє у своїх творах, стало фундаментом для подальших обговорень і розвитку політичної теорії, зробивши його вплив досі актуальним і значущим."},{"prompt":"Що об’єднує і чим відрізняються погляди Т. Гоббса і Дж. Локка на державу?","completion":"Томас Гоббс і Джон Локк - відомі політичні філософи, які значно вплинули на розвиток західної політичної думки. Обоє вони займалися питаннями природи людини, виникнення держави і взаємовідносин між державою та особистістю. Ось що об'єднує та відрізняє їхні погляди: Спільні риси: 1. Стан природи: Як Гоббс, так і Локк розглядали поняття \\"стану природи\\" - гіпотетичного стану суспільства, у якому не існує влади чи уряду, і люди живуть у вільному та нерегульованому вигляді. 2. Соціальний договір: Вони поділяли ідею соціального договору, за якою соціальний лад та державна влада виникають із добровільної згоди людей відмовитися від певної частини своєї свободи заради безпеки та захисту від держави. 3. Право на приватну власність: Локк і Гоббс визнали важливість існування приватної власності та вважали, що одним з основних завдань держави є забезпечення захисту цього права. Відмінності: 1. Погляди на людську природу: Гоббс вважав, що в стані природи люди діють здебільшого егоїстично та раціонально, \\"людина є вовком для людини\\" (\\"homo homini lupus\\"), і тому для запобігання суспільному хаосу необхідний всемогутній суверенний правитель. Локк мав більш оптимістичний погляд на природу людини, вважаючи, що люди здатні взаємодіяти раціонально і в мирний спосіб. 2. Влада та уряд: Доки Гоббс виступав за абсолютну монархію і всемогутнє правління одного правителя, Локк підтримував ідею обмеженої влади і поділу влади на законодавчу, виконавчу та федеративну (у його розумінні це включало право на міжнародні відносини). 3. Права особи: Гоббс вважав, що люди вибирають створення держави та підкоряються йому з метою самозахисту, іншими словами, основною функцією держави є забезпечення безпеки. Локк, з іншого боку, наголошував, що крім безпеки, держава також має гарантувати основні права людини, такі як життя, свобода та право на власність, і громадяни мають право на повстання, якщо держава не виконує свої обов'язки. У підсумку, Гоббс і Локк зіграли ключову роль у розвитку теорій державного правління і концепції прав і обов'язків у рамках суспільства, хоча і визначали ці ідеї в різні способи."},{"prompt":"Що характерно для поглядів К. Маркса і М. Вебера на політику і політичні процеси?","completion":"Карл Маркс і Макс Вебер були двома видатними фігурами в соціології і політичній теорії, проте їхні погляди на політику і політичні процеси значно відрізняються: Погляди Карла Маркса: 1. Матеріалістичне розуміння історії: Маркс розглядав політичні процеси крізь призму класової боротьби і економічних відносин, аргументуючи, що матеріальні умови життя визначають соціальну, політичну та інтелектуальну життя суспільства. 2. Базис і надбудова: У своїй теорії Маркс розділяє суспільство на економічну \\"базу\\" (способи виробництва, трудові відносини) і правово-політичну \\"надбудову\\", яка включає державні інституції, що служать інтересам пануючого класу. 3. Пролетарська революція: Маркс прогнозував, що неминучість пролетарської революції та утворення безкласового комуністичного суспільства буде кінцевим результатом класової боротьби в капіталістичних системах. Погляди Макса Вебера: 1. Розуміння держави: Вебер розглядав державу як організацію, що має монополію на легітимне використання фізичної сили в певної території. Він детально аналізував різні форми влади та її легітимності. 2. Типи господарювання: Вебер ідентифікував три чистих типи легітимної господарськості (традиційну, харизматичну, бюрократичну), які визначають як політичні, так і економічні системи. 3. Бюрократія: Вебер описав розвиток бюрократії як найбільш ефективний тип організації сучасного суспільства, розробивши ідеальний тип бюрократичної адміністрації. Хоча обидва мислителі займалися аналізом політики і влади, Маркс акцентує на економічних відносинах як на головному двигуні історичного прогресу та соціальних змін, в той час як Вебер розглядає більш широкі аспекти соціальної діяльності, включаючи релігію, культуру, організаційні форми та інші фактори, котрі формують соціальні структури і владні відносини."},{"prompt":"criar um testo focado em copytrade tickmill seo : CopyTrade Tickmill com Quase 5% de Retorno Médio Mensal?

Print to PDF (Virtual Printer): If you have large PDF files, you can try \\"printing\\" them as PDF using virtual printer drivers like Adobe PDF or Microsoft Print to PDF.

However, you can use other text editors or code editors that offer more advanced features, including the ability to adjust tab spacing. Some popular examples include Notepad++, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. These applications usually provide options to customize tab spacing based on your preferences. If you frequently work with .txt files and require control over tab spacing, using a more feature-rich text editor would be recommended."},{"prompt":"what food can I put on a skewer to BBQ","completion":"There are numerous delicious foods that you can put on skewers for barbecuing.

Grill the chicken skewers for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are cooked through and slightly charred on the edges. Ensure the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C). 8. Remove from the grill and let the skewers rest for a few minutes before serving.

Теперь у нас есть число вида 56?0. Нам также нужно, чтобы число делилось на 8. Для этого последние три цифры должны образовывать число, делящееся на 8.

Однако, поскольку нам нужно также соблюдать второе условие (кратность числу 5), то добавленная справа цифра \\"X\\" может быть только 0 или 5. Учитывая, что мы добавляем одинаковую цифру с обеих сторон, из возможных вариантов 0 или 5 подходит только 0 (потому что 5 не кратна 3). Таким образом, единственного подходящего числа будет 0150 или просто 150, и это число делится на 15. Мы не можем добавить 5 с обеих сторон, так как это нарушает условие делимости суммы цифр на 3 (1+5+5+5=16, 16 не делится на 3)."},{"prompt":"Які основні елементи теоретичної і політичної програми соціал-демократії?","completion":"Соціал-демократія є політичною ідеологією та рухом, який виник у другій половині 19 століття із зусиллями реформувати капіталізм демократичним шляхом, з метою зменшення соціальної нерівності. Головні принципи та елементи соціал-демократичної теоретичної та політичної програми включають наступне: 1. Соціальна справедливість: Соціал-демократи прагнуть до створення соціально справедливого суспільства, де нерівність є мінімізованою, а можливості для самореалізації є доступними для всіх членів суспільства. 2. Економічне регулювання: Вони підтримують державне регулювання економіки з метою запобігання монополізму, захисту прав споживачів і працівників, та забезпечення стабільності економічного циклу. 3. Соціальний захист: Соціал-демократія виступає за міцну систему соціального захисту, включаючи соціальне страхування, допомогу у безробітті, пенсійне забезпечення та якісну систему охорони здоров'я. 4. Прогресивне оподаткування: Вони відстоюють прогресивну податкову систему, де вищі доходи оподатковуються за вищою ставкою, що допомагає перерозподіляти багатство в суспільстві. 5. Освіта та навчання: Соціал-демократи підкреслюють важливість доступу до якісної освіти для всіх, розглядаючи це як засіб забезпечення рівних можливостей. 6. Захист трудових прав: Ідеологія підтримує захист трудових прав, включаючи право на створення профспілок, право на колективні переговори, і справедливі умови праці. 7. Екологічна сталість: Сучасні соціал-демократичні рухи включають в свої програми проблеми сталого розвитку і захисту довкілля. 8. Демократія і права людини: Соціал-демократи відстоюють демократичні цінності, включаючи громадянські свободи, політичний плюралізм, вільні вибори і верховенство права. 9. Мир і міжнародна співпраця: Вони також підтримують ідею міжнародної співпраці та мирного співіснування, включаючи захист прав людини і стабільності на міжнародній арені. Соціал-демократія розглядається як \\"центр-ліва\\" політична течія, яка шукає \\"третій шлях\\" між капіталізмом і соціалізмом, зберігаючи капіталістичну економічну систему, але із значною роллю держави в соціальній політиці та економічному регулюванні."},{"prompt":"Яка із ідеологій на вашу думку найбільше потрібна сучасній Україні?","completion":"Як штучний інтелект, я не маю власних думок чи переваг, і тому не можу висловлювати суб'єктивні судження щодо політики або ідеологій. Вибір ідеології для будь-якої країни, у тому числі і для України, залежить від багатьох факторів, включаючи історичний контекст, культуру, економічні умови, соціальні потреби й інші аспекти. Однак, можна зауважити, що у процесі вибору ідеології нація розглядає такі аспекти: 1. Відповідність до сучасних викликів: Це можуть бути економічні та фінансові умови, загроза конфліктів, потреба у сучасних реформах, екологічні питання тощо. 2. Соціальні цінності: Кожна країна має свої культурні, історичні та соціальні цінності, які вона прагне зберігати та розвивати. Ідеологія повинна поважати та відображати ці цінності. 3. Демократія та права людини: Базова потреба в дотриманні демократичних принципів і захисті прав і свобод громадян. 4. Економічний розвиток: Основні напрями для стимулювання економічного росту, інвестицій і покращення добробуту населення. 5. Національна безпека: Важливість забезпечення національної безпеки та територіальної цілісності, особливо у контексті зовнішніх загроз. 6. Міжнародне співробітництво: Орієнтація на міжнародну інтеграцію, зокрема щодо питань економічної співпраці, безпеки та культурного обміну.

Основні принципи демократії включають: 1. Народовладдя: Фундаментальний принцип, за яким усю владу має народ, і всі урядовці діють в ім'я народу та з його мандату. 2. Вибори: Проведення регулярних, вільних і справедливих виборів, які дають можливість народу обирати і відправляти з посад своїх представників у владі. 3. Багатопартійність: Наявність більш ніж однієї політичної партії, що забезпечує політичний плюралізм і можливість вибору для громадян. 4. Правова держава: Законодавство має бути верховним і однаково застосовуватися до всіх громадян, включаючи тих, хто знаходиться при владі. 5. Принцип поділу влади: Влада держави розділена на законодавчу, виконавчу та судову, щоб забезпечити баланс і взаємний контроль між різними гілками влади. 6. Захист основних прав та свобод: Гарантування і захист прав людини, включаючи свободу слова, релігії, мирних зібрань, і преси. 7. Рівність перед законом: Усі громадяни є рівними перед законом і мають рівний доступ до правосуддя, без дискримінації за будь-якими ознаками. 8. Прозорість та підзвітність: Урядовці зобов'язані діяти відкрито і нести відповідальність за свої дії перед народом. 9. Громадянське суспільство: Наявність активного громадянського суспільства, включаючи НУО та незалежні мас-медіа, які сприяють плуралізму та громадській участі. 10. Громадянська участь: Залучення громадян у політичний процес через різні форми, включаючи голосування, петиції та громадські слухання. Ці принципи є керівними для становлення та розвитку демократичних суспільств і держав. Міцна та стабільна демократія вимагає не тільки існування цих принципів на папері, але й їх активної підтримки та втілення на практиці."},{"prompt":"Приведіть приклади історичних форм демократії.","completion":"Історія демократії нараховує багато різноманітних форм і експериментів. Нижче наведено деякі історичні приклади демократії: 1. Давньогрецька демократія: Афінська демократія 5-го століття до н.е. вважається однією з перших форм демократії. В Афінах існувала пряма демократія, де громадяни (хоча це була лише невеличка частка населення, що включала вільних чоловіків-громадян, але не жінок, рабів, чи метеків – іноземців) мали можливість безпосередньо голосувати з різних питань на народних зборах. 2. Римська республіка: Хоча Рим не був демократією в сучасному розумінні цього слова, він розвинув республіканську систему з обраними зборами та магістратами, які представляли інтереси різних соціальних класів. 3. Давньогерманські \\"тинги\\": У скандинавських та інших германських народів існували народні збори, відомі як \\"тинги\\" або \\"віча\\", де вільні чоловіки вирішували спільні питання, заключали угоди та виносили правосуддя. 4. Середньовічні комунальні республіки: У деяких середньовічних європейських містах розвивалися форми самоврядування, де міські ради вибиралися міщанами для управління міськими справами. 5. Англійські магна-хартії та обмежена монархія: З підписанням Магна Хартії в 1215 році і розвитком палати громад в Англії, був започаткований поступовий перехід від абсолютної монархії до певних демократичних елементів представництва та контролю над владою короля. 6. Швейцарські кантони: У деяких кантонах Швейцарії існує стародавня традиція безпосередньої демократії, що включає народні збори на відкритому повітрі, де громадяни можуть напряму голосувати за закони та рішення. 7. Американська революція та створення США: Американська декларація незалежності та Конституція Сполучених Штатів поклали початок створенню однієї з перших сучасних демократичних систем з принципами народовладдя, поділу влад, та захисту прав та свобод громадян. 8. Французька революція: З революцією 1789 року в Франції були проголошені принципи свободи, рівності та братерства, які лягли в основу подальших демократичних рухів. Ці та інші приклади показують, як демократія розвивалася та адаптувалася до різних історичних та культурних контекстів, прогресуючи до систем більш близьких до сучасних форм представницьких демократій."},{"prompt":"50. Дайте характеристику парламентаризму.","completion":"Парламентаризм — це система урядування, в якій виконавча влада залежить від довіри і підтримки парламенту. Це широко поширений метод організації урядової влади, особливо в багатопартійних демократіях. Ключовим елементом цієї системи є тісний взаємозв'язок між законодавчою (парламент) і виконавчою (уряд) гілками влади. Ось основні характеристики парламентаризму: 1. Подвійна відповідальність: Уряд, формований замість президента прем'єр-міністром (або іншим головним міністром), відповідає перед парламентом. Уряд може залишитися при владі тільки до тих пір, поки зберігає підтримку більшості у законодавчому органі. 2. Розпуск парламенту: Зазвичай прем'єр-міністр має право просити главу держави (часто монарха або президента в республіканській формі) розпустити парламент і призначити нові вибори. Це може бути зроблено з різних причин, включаючи бажання отримати новий вотум довіри від народу або при неможливості парламенту сформувати ефективний уряд. 3. Відсутність строгого розділу влади: На відміну від президентської системи, де існує чітке розділення між виконавчою і законодавчою гілками влади, в парламентарній системі виконавча влада проходить з парламенту і є з ним тісно пов'язаною. 4. Колективна відповідальність: Міністри уряду несуть колективну відповідальність за дії уряду. Якщо парламент виражає недовіру одному міністру або уряду в цілому, це може призвести до відставки всього кабінету міністрів. 5. Партійні фракції: Партії і партійні фракції в парламенті мають значну роль в управлінні країною, адже підтримка уряду часто залежить від партійних блоків і коаліцій всередині парламенту. 6. Парламентські вибори: Вибори до парламенту зазвичай є головними виборами в державі, тому що саме парламент визначає склад уряду. Парламентаризм може варіюватися у різних країнах залежно від конкретної конституції, історії та політичної культури, але його ключові принципи зазвичай зберігаються."},{"prompt":"Назвіть основні етапи поширення демократії у світі.","completion":"Поширення демократії у світі можна розглянути як процес, що пройшов кілька ключових етапів: 1. Античний період: Практики, схожі на демократичні інститути, з'явилися у давній Греції, зокрема в Афінах, де в 5-му столітті до нашої ери розвивалася система прямої демократії. Громадяни (лише вільні чоловіки) мали можливість голосувати за закони на народних зборах, відомих як екклесія. 2. Середньовіччя та Відродження: Розвиток міських комун в Італії та інших частинах Європи, а також введення деяких обмежень на монарший абсолютизм у Великобританії (наприклад, Магна Хартія 1215 року) почали формувати умови для розвитку представницьких інститутів. 3. Просвітництво: Вплив філософських ідей Просвітництва в 17-му та 18-му століттях сприяв популяризації концепцій демократії, верховенства права і прав людини. Виникнення політичних теорій таких думців, як Джон Локк та Жан-Жак Руссо, підтримало ідеї народовладдя та конституційної демократії. 4. Американська та Французька революції: Кінець 18-го століття був ознаменований двома революціями, які мали величезний вплив на розвиток демократії. Американська революція привела до створення Конституції Сполучених Штатів Америки, що вважається одним з перших документів, що заснував сучасну республіку. Французька революція, яка почалася в 1789 році, проголошувала ідеї свободи, рівності та братерства. 5. Хвилі демократизації у 19-20 століттях: Розширення виборчого права, падіння монархій, а згодом і створення багатьох нових демократичних держав після Першої світової війни сприяли подальшому поширенню демократії. 6. Післявоєнна демократизація: Після Другої світової війни було створено міжнародні організації, такі як Організація Об'єднаних Націй, що закріпила верховенство права та права людини як універсальні цінності. Період розколини в колоніальних системах призвів до створення нових незалежних держав, багато з яких устремлялися до демократії. 7. \\"Третя хвиля\\" демократизації: Починаючи з 1970-х, багато країн Латинської Америки, Південної Європи, Південної та Східної Азії вибралися з під авторитарних режимів і перейшли до демократичного устрою. Пізніше ця хвиля охопила Східну Європу і пострадянські республіки після падіння Берлінської стіни та розпаду Радянського Союзу в 1989–1991 роках. 8. Сучасний період: На початку 21-го століття демократія зіткнулася з новими викликами, включно з ростом популізму, авторитаризмом, інформаційними війнами та глобальною невизначеністю. Однак багато країн продовжують прагнути до демократичного розвитку та зміцнення демократичних інститутів. В цілому, поширення демократії є динамічним процесом, що міститься в контексті ширших історичних подій і боротьби за політичну владу, соціальну справедливість і права людини."},{"prompt":"Проаналізуй шляхи переходу народів від тоталітаризму до демократії","completion":"Перехід від тоталітаризму до демократії є складним і багатогранним процесом, який залежить від багатьох внутрішніх і зовнішніх факторів. Оскільки кожна країна має свою унікальну історію, культуру та політичні обставини, шляхи до демократії можуть значно відрізнятися. Проте існують деякі загальні стратегії та етапи, які часто спостерігаються в процесі демократизації: 1. Завершення тоталітарного режиму: Часто спричинено економічною кризою, внутрішнім політичним невдоволенням, поразками на міжнародній арені, зовнішнім тиском, чи смертю тоталітарного лідера. Зміни можуть початися з мирних протестів, громадянських рухів або, в деяких випадках, через військові конфлікти чи революції. 2. Лібералізація: Наступний крок зазвичай передбачає послаблення державного контролю над суспільством, звільнення політичних в'язнів, легалізацію опозиційних партій та засобів масової інформації, а також припинення політичних репресій. 3. Правова реформа: Важливим етапом є встановлення та утвердження правової державності, створення незалежного судочинства, прийняття законодавства, яке визначає основи демократичного устрою та захисту прав і свобод громадян. 4. Проведення демократичних виборів: На цьому етапі проводяться вільні та справедливі вибори, які дозволяють народу вибирати своїх представників. Зазвичай це супроводжується міжнародним спостереженням для забезпечення легітимності виборчого процесу. 5. Конституційна реформа: Прийняття або перегляд конституції для закріплення демократичного устрою і розподілу влади між законодавчими, виконавчими, та судовими органами. 6. Інституційні реформи: Створення або реформування ключових державних інститутів для забезпечення прозорості, підзвітності та ефективності влади. 7. Розвиток громадянського суспільства: Підтримка незалежних засобів масової інформації, НУО, професпілок та інших громадських організацій є критично важливою для розвитку активної громадянської культури та участі в політичному житті. 8. Міжнародна підтримка: Підтримка з боку міжнародних організацій і демократичних держав, яка може включати економічну допомогу, консультації у сфері вибудовування демократії, та інвестиції в освіту та розвиток. 9. Примирення: У країнах, де тоталітарний режим влаштовував глибокі соціальні поділи, етап примирення може включати створення комісій правди та примирення, переслідування злочинів минулого режиму та вирішення історичних суперечок. Перехід до демократії є складним, часто нестабільним процесом, який може включати кроки назад та потребувати багаторазових зусиль. Також важливо розуміти, що перехід до демократії не завжди лінійний і може включати періоди переходу, часто ознаменовані конфліктами і політичною нестабільністю."},{"prompt":"Визначте основні принципи демократії які закладені в Конституції України.","completion":"Конституція України, яка була прийнята 28 червня 1996 року, закріплює декілька основних принципів демократії. Ось ключові з них: 1. Народовладдя: У статті 5 зазначено, що носієм суверенітету та єдиним джерелом влади в Україні є народ. Влада здійснюється народом через вільні вибори, референдуми та інші форми прямого волевиявлення, а також через органи державної влади та органи місцевого самоврядування. 2. Поділ влади: Конституція передбачає систему поділу влади на законодавчу (Верховна Рада), виконавчу (Президент та Кабінет Міністрів) та судову (незалежні суди). Визначено механізми контролю та балансування між різними гілками влади. 3. Правова держава: Стаття 8 проголошує, що Україна є правовою державою. Конституція України та закони мають вищу юридичну силу на всій території країни. Верховенство права в Україні означає, що дії урядових інститутів, чиновників і громадян регулюються та обмежуються законом. 4. Демократичні вибори: Виборче право гарантовано як універсальне, рівне, пряме та таємне голосування. Регулярні демократичні вибори є основою представницької системи влади. 5. Законодавча ініціатива: Конституція дозволяє громадянам України брати участь в законодавчому процесі через законодавчу ініціативу, яка дає групі громадян право запропонувати певні законопроекти. 6. Людська гідність та основні права: Декларується незаперечність прав і свобод людини, їхнє визнання найвищою соціальною цінністю, а також їхній захист є обов'язком держави. Включає свободу слова, право на справедливий суд, свободу зібрань, і багато інших фундаментальних свобод та прав. 7. Рівноправність перед законом: Всі громадяни України є рівними перед законом, і дискримінація за будь-якими ознаками забороняється. 8. Федеративне устрій: Україна є унітарною державою з територіальним поділом на автономну республіку, області, райони, міста тощо, забезпечуючи баланс центральної влади та місцевого самоврядування. 9. Прозорість уряду та підзвітність: Конституція вимагає від урядових інститутів та посадовців відкритості у своїй роботі та підзвітності перед громадянами. 10. Референдуми: Громадяни України мають право на зміну конституційного устрою країни через всенародні референдуми. Ці та інші принципи, закріплені в Конституції України, створюють правову основу для демократичної системи урядування, що ґрунтується на захисті прав та свобод громадян, та ефективної взаємодії між різними гілками влади."},{"prompt":"Як співвідноситься розвиток громадянського суспільства і демократії?","completion":"Розвиток громадянського суспільства та демократії є тісно взаємопов'язаними.

Громадянське суспільство сприяє розвитку та підтримці демократії через наступні аспекти: 1. Посилення громадської участі: Громадянське суспільство дає можливість людям об'єднуватися з метою досягнення спільних інтересів і забезпечує платформи для участі в політичному та суспільному житті, що є основою для демократичного управління. 2. Розвиток плюралізму: Різноманітні групи та організації громадянського суспільства представляють різні інтереси й думки, що сприяє існуванню різноманітних думок та позицій у суспільстві. 3. Контроль влади: Активне громадянське суспільство може стати ефективним інструментом виявлення порушень і зловживань з боку влади, сприяючи прозорості та підзвітності. 4. Соціальний капітал: Зміцнює соціальну кооперацію та довіру, що є важливими компонентами для ефективного функціонування демократії. 5. Захист прав і свобод: НУО та інші елементи громадянського суспільства часто виступають захисниками прав людини та свобод, протидіють дискримінації та поділяють демократичні цінності. 6. Політичне виховання: Через освітні програми та громадські кампанії громадянське суспільство виховує інформованих та активних громадян, що є основою для демократичної участі. 7. Інновації та реформи: Громадянське суспільство може ініціювати та просувати соціальні інновації, покращуючи державну політику та законодавство. 8. Суспільний діалог та примирення: Організації громадянського суспільства можуть допомагати встановленню діалогу і досягненню консенсусу між різними суспільними групами, особливо у постконфліктних та перехідних суспільствах.

У класичному розумінні, громадянське суспільство складається з різноманітних організацій та об’єднань, які функціонують незалежно від керівного впливу держави. Як противага, громадянське суспільство служить кількома важливими функціями: 1. **Контрбаланс влади:** Громадянське суспільство часто виступає як контрбаланс до влади держави, запобігаючи зловживанням і концентрації влади в єдиних руках. НУО, ЗМІ, профспілки та інші групи можуть виступати критиками урядової політики або викликати рахунки за дії уряду. 2. **Захист прав індивіда:** Громадянське суспільство може захищати права і свободи індивідів проти державного вторгнення і авторитаризму. Різноманіття думок та організаційної сили може запобігати порушенням прав людини. 3. **Простір для самовираження:** Громадянське суспільство дає можливість індивідам і групам виражати їхні інтереси, погляди і цінності незалежно від державних інституцій, підтримуючи плюралізм та індивідуальну свободу. 4. **Джерело соціальних змін:** Незалежні громадянські об'єднання часто ініціюють соціальні, правові та політичні реформи, сприяючи продуктивному діалогу та прогресивним змінам у суспільстві. 5. **Розвиток об’єднавчих тенденцій:** Громадянське суспільство забезпечує майданчик для об’єднавчих ініціатив і колаборації між різними сегментами населення, часто працюючи на суспільне благо. 6. **Надання суспільних послуг:** Організації громадянського суспільства можуть надавати освітні, соціальні, культурні та інші послуги, які можуть доповнювати або навіть заміщувати державні програми. Попри противагу між громадянським суспільством і державою, в ідеальній демократичній системі вони не повинні сприйматися як протиборчі сторони, але як комплементарні елементи, які працюють разом для досягнення балансованих і ефективних результатів для суспільства.

Громадянське суспільство, таким чином, є критично важливим для здорового, багатогранного та динамічного демократичного суспільства. Воно включає різноманітне середовище, в якому кожна організація, група або рух вносить свій внесок у загальну роботу на користь суспільних інтересів та добробуту."},{"prompt":"Дайте визначення поняття «політичнакультура».","completion":"Поняття \\"політична культура\\" відноситься до суми поглядів, цінностей, ставлень, звичаїв та норм, які характеризують спосіб, в який громадяни та групи в суспільстві взаємодіють з політичною системою, розуміють своє місце в ній та виражають своє ставлення до політичних процесів та інституцій. Політична культура завжди знаходиться в стані розвитку та зміни, оскільки вона формується під впливом історичного досвіду, соціально-економічних умов, образовної системи, мас-медіа та інших чинників, що впливають на суспільні настрої та переконання. Дослідження політичної культури зосереджуються на розумінні того, як і чому громадяни взаємодіють з державою та її інституціями в певний спосіб, як вони реагують на політичні події, їхню участь у політичному житті та на їх очікування від уряду та політичних лідерів. Політична культура важлива, тому що вона впливає на політичну стабільність, демократичну участь, політичний плюралізм і здатність суспільства досягати згоди чи розробляти компромісні рішення. Вона може варіюватися від високо авторитарних та догматичних до глибоко демократичних та учасницьких залежно від країни та історичного контексту."},{"prompt":"Якою є структура та функції політичної культури?","completion":"Структура політичної культури визначається як умовно постійний набір елементів, які керують політичною діяльністю та взаємодією, включаючи цінності, переконання, норми, символи і ставлення. Вона може бути розглянута в декількох розрізах: **Когнітивна складова:** Знання та уявлення про політичну систему, процеси, інститути, історію та актуальні політичні події. **Афективна складова:** Емоційне ставлення до політики, політичних лідерів, інститутів та політичних процесів. **Оцінна складова:** Наглядові та критичні оцінки, які громадяни дають політичній системі, в тому числі судження про справедливість, ефективність та легітимність політичних інститутів та постатей. **Нормативна складова:** Уявлення про те, як мають відбуватися політичні процеси і як повинні поводити себе учасники політичного життя, включаючи ідеалізовані зразки поведінки та функціонування політичної системи. Функції політичної культури включають: **Орієнтаційна функція:** Політична культура допомагає громадянам орієнтуватися в політичній системі, надаючи ментальну \\"карту\\" основних інститутів, процесів та норм. **Інтегративна функція:** Забезпечення соціальної солідарності та згуртованості через спільні цінності, вірування і ідентифікацію з політичною спільнотою. **Функція соціалізації:** Передача та посилення політичних цінностей, норм і поведінки новим поколінням через освіту, сім'ю, медіа та інші суспільні інституції. **Функція мобілізації:** Сприяння політичній участі громадян, їх активності та впливу на політичні процеси, а також формування громадянської позиції. **Функція регуляції:** Регулювання соціальної поведінки і конфліктів через норми, культурні зразки і цінності, які сприяють соціальному порядку та стабільності. **Адаптаційна функція:** Допомагає суспільству адаптуватися до змін та нових викликів через здатність змінювати політичні цінності та норми у відповідь на внутрішні та зовнішні події. Політична культура є критично важливою для здоров'я та життєздатності будь-якої політичної системи, оскільки вона відображає та впливає на політичну динаміку і демократичні процеси в суспільстві."},{"prompt":"Яку роль у функціонуванні політичної культури виконують політичні цінності, ідеали, традиції, міфи, стереотипи, символи?","completion":"Політичні цінності, ідеали, традиції, міфи, стереотипи та символи мають важливу роль у формуванні та функціонуванні політичної культури, оскільки вони допомагають визначити характер та динаміку політичних процесів у суспільстві. Далі наведені основні ролі цих елементів: 1. **Політичні цінності:** Визначають основні принципи і ідеали, які є прийнятними у суспільстві, такі як свобода, рівність, справедливість, права людини та демократія. Цінності формують уявлення громадян про бажане політичне життя та напрями розвитку їхнього суспільства. 2. **Політичні ідеали:** Становлять модель оптимального устрою політичної системи та ідеального політичного управління. Вони впливають на політичні очікування та аспірації громадян, а також на їхню заангажованість у політичну діяльність. 3. **Традиції:** Складаються з набору звичайних поведінкових практик та історичних зразків, які передаються з покоління в покоління і впливають на політичний порядок і стабільність. Традиції можуть визначати стандарти поведінки громадянського суспільства та управління. 4. **Міфи:** Часто у формі оповідей або переказів, вони створюють спільне уявлення про історію, національну ідентичність або політичний порядок, підсилюючи соціальну згуртованість та відносини до політичної системи. 5. **Стереотипи:** Генералізовані уявлення або погляди на певні групи, процеси або ідеї, які можуть спрощувати складність політичних явищ, але також можуть спотворювати реальність та призводити до упереджень і поділів у суспільстві. 6. **Символи:** Через національні прапори, герби, пам'ятні дати та політичні слогани, символи передають значущі елементи політичної культури і заохочують громадян до ідентифікації зі своїм народом, державою або політичними рухами. Ці елементи спільно створюють узгоджену структуру сприйняття та взаємодії в рамках політичної системи, дають змогу прогнозувати політичну поведінку і сприяють формуванню спільних визначень та параметрів, на базі яких громадяни можуть поділяти думки, дискутуючи та приймаючи рішення з політичних питань."},{"prompt":"Розкрийте сутність політичної соціалізації, її фази.","completion":"Політична соціалізація — це процес, за допомогою якого індивіди в суспільстві навчаються та внутрішньо засвоюють політичні норми, цінності, погляди та моделі поведінки, що усталені в їх культурі. Він є необхідною умовою для передачі політичної культури від одного покоління до іншого та для формування активних та свідомих громадян. Сутність політичної соціалізації полягає в тому, що людина: 1. **Набуває знань** про політичну систему, закони, публічні інституції, політичні права та обов'язки. 2. **Розвиває навички** участі в політичному процесі, включаючи голосування, участь в дебатах, кампаніях та інші форми політичної діяльності. 3. **Формує ставлення** до влади, політичних партій, політики та політичних лідерів. 4. **Усвідомлює свою ідентичність** як члена політичної спільноти, нації чи держави. Фази політичної соціалізації можна поділити на: 1. **Дитинство:** На цьому етапі діти починають вчиться первинних політичних понять та символів (наприклад, прапор країни), часто через ігри та основну освіту. 2. **Підлітковий вік:** Це критичний час для розвитку політичної ідентичності, коли молоді люди починають формувати більш складні розуміння політичної системи і беруть участь у політичних обговореннях. 3. **Рання зрілість:** Молоді дорослі активніше залучаються в політичні процеси, починаючи брати участь у виборах, демонстраціях, публічній службі тощо. 4. **Зрілість:** Протягом зрілого віку люди часто стають повністю соціалізованими у політичній системі, мають усталені політичні переконання та часто беруть на себе ролі лідерів, показуючи приклад молодшим поколінням. Агенти політичної соціалізації включають сім'ю, школи, засоби масової інформації, релігійні та громадські інститути, друзів та колег, а також політичні партії та рухи. Цей процес може бути формальним, як наприклад, через освітньої системи, або неформальним, через повсякденні дискусії та особисті досвіди. Кожен з цих агентів вносить свій вклад у формування політичних орієнтацій та поведінки індивіда."},{"prompt":"У чому специфіка патріархальної, підданської та активістськоїполітичних культур?","completion":"Поняття патріархальної, підданської та активістської політичних культур стосується трьох різних типів політичних орієнтацій, які можуть існувати в суспільстві та, до певної міри, характеризувати відносини громадян до політичної системи, їхній рівень участі та очікування від неї. Специфіка кожної з цих політичних культур полягає в наступному: **Патріархальна політична культура:** - **Традиціоналізм:** Основою є традиційні цінності, стабільність і відтворення існуючого порядку. - **Авторитетність:** Політичні рішення зосереджені в руках еліти, старших за віком, чи традиційно респектабельних осіб (наприклад, старійшин, патріархів). - **Роль індивіда:** Громадяни зазвичай не беруть активної участі в політиці, а замість цього шукають керівництва та вказівок у їх “патріархів”. **Підданська політична культура:** - **Пасивність:** Громадяни не беруть активної участі в політиці, а більше націлені на дотримання законів та слідування правилам. - **Залежність:** Відносини громадян і держави характеризуються підкоренням владі, що залишається неконтрольованою від народу. - **Низьке очікування:** Низький рівень очікувань щодо того, що індивід може вплинути на політику або державні рішення. **Активістська політична культура:** - **Участь:** Громадяни відчувають високий рівень особистої компетентності та зобов'язаність участі в політиці. - **Впливовість:** Вважається, що громадяни мають реальну можливість впливати на політичні рішення та процеси управління. - **Активізм:** Існує розвинута мережа громадянських організацій, які сприяють політичній участі та відстоюють інтереси людей. Кожна з цих політичних культур має свої переваги та недоліки залежно від контексту, в якому вона функціонує. Патріархальна культура може забезпечувати стабільність, але може перешкоджати соціальним змінам та розвитку демократії. Підданська культура може підтримувати порядок, але також утримувати людей у стані політичної апатії. Активістська культура сприяє демократичним інститутам і громадській участі, але може призвести до політичної поляризації і конфлікту, якщо громадська активність стане надмірною або неефективною."},{"prompt":"Розкрийте зміст поняття «громадянська культура»","completion":"Поняття \\"громадянська культура\\" (civil culture) асоціюється з дослідженнями Габріеля Алмонда і Сідні Верби, представленими в їх класичній роботі \\"Громадянська культура. Політичні ставлення та демократія в п'яти країнах\\" 1963 року. Вони вживали цей термін для опису типу політичної культури, який вважається оптимальним для функціонування демократичних систем. Громадянська культура характеризується: 1. **Отриманими знаннями:** Велика частина населення має реальні знання про політичні процеси, закони та інститути, що дозволяє їм брати обґрунтовану участь в політичному житті. 2. **Активною участю:** Громадяни беруть активну участь в політиці через голосування, добровільну роботу на виборах, членство в політичних партіях та громадянських рухах. 3. **Толерантністю до різноманітності:** Існує толерантне ставлення до різних політичних поглядів та конструктивно вирішуються суспільні конфлікти. 4. **Довірою до інститутів:** Підтримується достатній рівень довіри до політичних інститутів та інших громадян, що є основою для узгодження інтересів і компромісів. 5. **Раціонально-критичною орієнтацією:** Громадяни підходять критично до різних політичних рішень і лідерів, уникнення сліпої відданості будь-якій політичній фігурі або партії. Громадянська культура забезпечує підтримку демократичної системи, але ця підтримка не є безумовною чи некритичною. Громадська думка проявляється у здатності до мирного зміни лідерів та політичних курсів через вибори та інші демократичні механізми.

Вони можуть формувати політичні переконання та ставлення громадян. 7. **Соціальні рухи та організації:** Активність громадянського суспільства та здатність соціальних груп організовуватися та впливати на політичний процес забезпечують платформу для політичної участі і змін. 8. **Міжнародні чинники:** Вплив глобалізації, інтеграційних процесів, міжнародних правових стандартів та зовнішньополітичних подій також може впливати на розвиток національної політичної культури. 9. **Демографічні процеси:** Зміна вікової структури населення, міграція та змішування культур мають вплив на зміну та розвиток політичної культури. Ці та інші фактори не існують ізольовано; вони взаємопов'язані і взаємодіють один з одним, ускладнюючи процес формування політичної культури.

Однак, можна виокремити деякі основні риси, які характерні для політичної культури українського народу в останні десятиліття: 1. **Стремління до демократії:** Здобуття незалежності в 1991 році та подальші політичні події (наприклад, Помаранчева революція в 2004 році та Революція Гідності в 2013–2014 роках) свідчать про прагнення українців до демократичних цінностей, лібералізації політичної системи та вільного вираження волі. 2. **Політична активність:** Наростання громадянської активності, зокрема серед молоді, і широка участь в недержавних організаціях та рухах. 3. **Цінність приватної власності та ринкових відносин:** Зміцнення основ ринкової економіки та підтримка ідеї приватного підприємництва як засобу досягнення економічного успіху. 4. **Наростання національної свідомості:** Останні роки відзначаються зростанням української національної самобутності та культурної ідентичності, особливо в контексті російської агресії на сході України та анексії Криму. 5. **Підтримка європейської інтеграції:** Бажання інтегруватися в європейські та трансатлантичні структури, такі як Європейський Союз та НАТО. 6. **Соціально-критичний погляд:** Суспільство показало здатність критикувати органи влади та вимагати відповідальності, прозорості та ефективності урядування. 7. **Регіональні особливості:** Політична культура в Україні має виразні регіональні відмінності, що обумовлені історичними, етнічними, культурними та економічними факторами. 8. **Мовне питання:** Мовна ситуація в Україні є важливим фактором політичних уподобань та ідентичності. 9. **Віра в ідеалів незалежності:** Незалежність України є ключовим елементом політичної свідомості, особливо в контексті останніх воєнних конфліктів на сході країни та анексії Криму Росією. Ці особливості не є вичерпними та можуть змінюватися залежно від політичної кон’юнктури, зміни поколінь та інших факторів, що впливають на динамічний характер політичної культури."},{"prompt":"Що таке національний суверенітет","completion":"Національний суверенітет — це концепція в міжнародних відносинах і політичній теорії, яка означає вищу, незалежну владу держави в межах її територіальних кордонів і відсутність будь-якої вищої влади над державними інститутами. Термін \\"суверенітет\\" відображає концепцію самоврядування та самостійного прийняття рішень.

Кожна держава діє в межах власного суверенітету, часто враховуючи власні національні інтереси. 2. **Залежність від національної сили:** Відносини між країнами часто визначаються їхніми відносними національними силами, включаючи економічний потенціал, військову міць та політичний вплив. 3. **Важливість дипломатії:** Дипломатія залишається основним інструментом ведення міжнародних відносин, забезпечуючи засоби для переговорів і вирішення конфліктів. 4. **Інтереси та ідеології:** Політика окремих держав формується на основі їх національних інтересів та ідеологічних орієнтирів. 5. **Глобалізація:** Світова економічна інтеграція, глобальний потік інформації та транснаціональні корпорації вносять свій вклад у формування міжнародних відносин. 6. **Міжнародне право та інституції:** Держави створюють і підтримують міжнародні організації та закони, які регулюють аспекти міжнародної співпраці і конфліктів. 7. **Багатосторонність та двосторонність:** Відносини можуть бути як багатосторонніми, за участю багатьох країн, так і двосторонніми, в межах яких відбуваються відносини між двома конкретними державами. 8. **Безпекові питання:** Відносини часто зосереджуються на питаннях національної та міжнародної безпеки, включаючи стратегічне балансування, військовозасобні змаги та альянси. 9. **Культурні та інформаційні обміни:** Включають розповсюдження культури, ідей, інформаційних потоків та значень через кордони. 10. **Неурядові актори:** Роль неурядових організацій, міжнародних корпорацій, мереж активістів та інших неурядових акторів у формуванні міжнародних агенди і вирішенні світових проблем. Міжнародні відносини – це сфера взаємодії, в якій постійно присутнє напруження між співпрацею та конфліктом.

Модернізація, як процес, передбачає перехід від традиційно організованих суспільств до промислово розвинених, бюрократично устроєних, урбанізованих і технологічно продвинутих суспільств. У контексті міжнародних відносин цей напрям фокусується на таких аспектах: 1. **Раціоналізація і інституціоналізм:** Політика базується на раціональному аналізі та практичних розрахунках інтересів, а співпраця між державами стабілізується за рахунок міжнародних інституцій та угод. 2. **Економічний розвиток як основа політичної сили:** Модерністські підходи не рідко асоціюються з припущенням, що економічний розвиток є ключовим фактором національної могутності та міжнародної конкурентоспроможності. 3. **Демократізація:** Зв'язок між демократичними інститутами та миролюбністю у відносинах між державами сьогодні часто виражається теорією \\"демократичного мира\\", за якою демократичні держави рідко вступають в конфлікти одна з одною. 4. **Зміна ролі держави:** Держави продовжують грати важливу роль у міжнародних відносинах, однак їх вплив модифікується через процеси глобалізації, чималу важливість набувають недержавні актори, такі як транснаціональні корпорації та міжнародні НУО. 5. **Нові загрози і виклики:** Модернізація вважає загрозою не тільки традиційну військову агресію, а й такі проблеми, як міжнародний тероризм, глобальне потепління, кібербезпека тощо. 6. **Технологічний прогрес:** Технології розглядаються як чинник, що впливає на динаміку глобальної політики, в тому числі через поширення інформації, зміну оборонних стратегій та перетворення економічної діяльності.

There's a button that also toggles the \`diceMode\` state. 6. A slider is included that allows users to change the \`sliderValue\`, and the width of a colored bar (\`sliderProgressWidth\`) reflects the slider's value. 7. There are sections for configuring actions on win and on loss, such as resetting or increasing the bet by a percentage. 8.

Google strongly supports PWA development, considering it the future of software. The idea of a PWA wasn't invented by Google or Apple, but it was Steve Jobs who first presented the concept in front of the world during the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. However, Jobs wanted developers to build apps using standard web technologies to increase the popularity of the iPhone.","completion":"**Evolution of Progressive Web App (PWA) Technology** Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs, represent a significant shift in the web application landscape. Although PWAs officially entered the tech lexicon around 2015, their conceptual foundation can be traced back to Steve Jobs in 2007. During the iPhone announcement, Jobs proposed the idea of creating web apps that would look and behave like native apps, using standard web technologies. This vision laid the groundwork for what would eventually become known as PWAs. Google has been one of the dominant forces behind the development and advocacy of PWAs. Recognizing their potential to bridge the gap between web experiences and the capabilities of native applications, Google embraced the concept and has promoted PWA technology as a future-forward approach to software development. PWAs utilize a range of modern browser features, such as service workers, a manifest file, and an app shell architecture, to deliver fast, reliable, and engaging user experiences. Service workers, in particular, enable PWAs to operate offline or on low-quality networks, perform background data syncing, and send push notifications—much like a native app. The manifest file allows PWAs to be added to a device's home screen with an icon, making them readily accessible. Furthermore, the app shell architecture ensures that users perceive the PWA as performant, with quick loading times and smooth interactions, by caching the basic UI elements needed for the app to run. Since their inception, PWAs have gradually become more sophisticated, supported by continuous enhancement to web standards and browser capabilities. The technology not only meets the demand for a seamless, cross-platform experience but also addresses the user’s desire for applications that consume less data and storage space. As more browsers have adopted PWA-compatible features and as mobile internet usage continues to grow, businesses have increasingly turned to PWAs to enhance online presence and user reach. By offering an app-like experience without the need for app store distribution, PWAs present an attractive model for software delivery—one that combines the broad reach of the web with the rich experience of a native application. The maturation of PWA technology points to a future where users can experience the full capabilities and ease of use of native apps directly from their web browsers, regardless of device or operating system. This technology offers an inclusive and flexible solution that caters to the diverse needs of the global internet-using population."},{"prompt":"answwer this quora amswer as im answering from my pown wxprince to user giving them info in 600 wrds - How much does it cost to develop an LMS system?","completion":"The cost of developing a Learning Management System (LMS) can vary widely depending on several factors, including the complexity of the system, the features required, customization, whether you opt for a cloud-based or self-hosted solution, and the geographical location of your development team. As an experienced expert in the field, I can provide you with an overview of these factors to help you understand the potential costs involved. **1. Complexity and Scope of the LMS:** The complexity and scope of the LMS play a significant role in determining the cost. A basic LMS with standard features such as course creation, user registration, and simple testing capabilities might start at around 15,000 to 30,000. On the other hand, a comprehensive LMS with advanced features such as AI-driven content recommendations, advanced reporting, custom user roles, or gamification can take the costs up to 80,000 or more. **2. Feature Set and Customization:** The feature set you choose will directly impact the development cost. Some common features like multimedia support, mobile-friendliness, discussion forums, and ecommerce integration are expected in a modern LMS. However, specialized features like SCORM or xAPI compliance, social learning capabilities, or integration with third-party tools (like Zoom or Salesforce) will add to the development time and cost. The more customization you require, the higher the cost will be. **3. Development Approach:** You have two primary approaches for LMS development: custom development or using an off-the-shelf platform. Custom development, where an LMS is built from scratch to meet specific requirements, is usually the costlier option. It provides a unique solution tailored to your needs but can cost anywhere from 50,000 to more than 250,000, depending on complexity. Alternatively, using an open-source LMS like Moodle or a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform could potentially reduce the cost significantly, though you'll need to account for customization, hosting, and subscription fees. **4. Geographical Location:** The geographical location of your development team is another significant factor. Development rates can range widely depending on where your developers are located. For instance, developers from North America or Western Europe typically charge 100–250 per hour, while developers from Eastern Europe, Latin America, or Asia may charge 25–100 per hour. When considering offshore development, factor in potential challenges like time zones, language barriers, and cultural differences, which could impact the overall cost and timeline. **5. Maintenance and Support:** Post-launch maintenance, updates, and support are costs that you should also consider. An LMS will need regular updates, bug fixes, security patches, and potential feature upgrades, which could add an annual cost ranging from 10% to 20% of the initial development cost. **6. Hosting and Other Operational Costs:** Cloud hosting for a SaaS LMS involves ongoing costs that can be based on user numbers, data storage, or usage levels. Self-hosting will require servers, bandwidth, and potential licensing fees which need to be factored into the total cost. **In Summary:** As an expert, I would suggest budgeting at least 20,000 to 30,000 for a basic LMS, and well over 50,000 for a more advanced, custom LMS with specialized features. Remember that while upfront costs are important, the long-term value an LMS brings through efficient training, improved learning outcomes, and administrative ease, can far outweigh the initial investment. It's crucial to clearly define your requirements, consider the cost of not only development but also maintenance and operations, and consult with a development partner who can offer insights specific to your project needs."},{"prompt":"answwer this quora amswer as im answering from my pown wxprince to user giving them info in 600 wrds - How much does it cost to develop an LMS system?","completion":"The cost of developing a Learning Management System (LMS) can vary widely depending on a range of factors including complexity, customization, features, user counts, and the region where the developers are located. I will provide an overview while considering various aspects that play into the development cost. **Understanding LMS Features and Requirements** Before diving into the numbers, it's crucial to understand that the cost is directly related to the features and requirements of the LMS. A basic LMS with standard features such as course creation, learner registration, and progress tracking can be less costly compared to a sophisticated platform that requires advanced features like gamification, artificial intelligence, integration with other systems, or complex reporting abilities. **Breakdown of LMS Development Costs** 1. **Pre-Development Costs**: This includes the cost of market research, business analysis, and creating a detailed requirement specification. The work done at this stage lays the groundwork for the project and can cost from 2,000 to 10,000 depending on the depth of research and planning required. 2. **Design Costs**: The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design are critical for the success of an LMS. A good design should be intuitive and engaging. Depending on the level of sophistication and customization, design costs can range from 5,000 to 20,000. 3. **Development Costs**: Actual coding accounts for a significant portion of the expenses. For a custom LMS from scratch, development costs can range between 30,000 and 100,000, but they can easily exceed that for more complex systems. This phase includes front-end and back-end development, setting up databases, server architecture, and ensuring that all software components work smoothly together. 4. **Testing and Quality Assurance Costs**: To ensure the platform is functional, secure, and user-friendly, thorough testing is imperative. This phase may take up a considerable part of the budget ranging from 5,000 to 15,000. 5. **Integration Costs**: Integrating with third-party applications, such as web conferencing tools, payment gateways, and CRM software can add to the cost.

Термін \\"геополітика\\" виник наприкінці 19 століття і був популяризований шведським політологом Рудольфом Кьєлленом та німецьким географом Фрідріхом Ратцелем. Вони вважали, що політична влада та суверенітет держав тісно пов'язані із їх географічним положенням і фізичним ландшафтом. У XX столітті геополітика отримала широке розповсюдження завдяки аналітичним та теоретичним роботам, таким як \\"Heartland Theory\\" британського географа Хелфорда Макіндера, який вважав, що контроль над Центральною Азією (серцевиною оськової області світу) є ключем до світового панування. Геополітика охоплює такі питання як: - Стратегічне планування та військові альянси з урахуванням географічного положення країн. - Аналіз впливу природних ресурсів (нафта, газ, мінерали) на міжнародні відносини. - Вивчення глобальних транспортних шляхів та торговельних маршрутів. - Задачі зміцнення або поширення впливу через \\"мяку силу\\" (культуру, ідеологію, дипломатію) або \\"жорстку силу\\" (військову інтервенцію). Сучасна геополітика включає також аналіз глобальних екологічних змін, міграційних потоків, епідемій, кібербезпеки та інших викликів і загроз, які мають транснаціональний характер. Важливою частиною геополітичного аналізу є оцінка потенційних конфліктних ситуацій та сценаріїв розвитку міжнародних відносин на основі чинників, що входять до геополітичного простору."},{"prompt":"Розкрийте структуру міжнародних відносин.","completion":"Міжнародні відносини — це комплексна система взаємодій між різними суб'єктами на міжнародній арені.

Ось деякі з них: 1. Глобалізація: Збільшення взаємозалежності та інтеграції між країнами у різноманітних сферах — економіці, культурі, технологіях. Це сприяє взаємному обміну товарів, послуг та інформації, але також може призводити до конфліктів іного рівня та пружності національних економік до глобальних криз. 2. Інформаційні технології: Швидке розвиток та проникнення цифрових технологій оформлюють інформаційний вимір глобальних процесів. Інтернет і соціальні мережі змінюють способи спілкування, доступу до інформації та формування громадської думки. 3. Зміна балансу сил: Ростучий вплив нових світових гравців, як-от Китай та Індія, змінює традиційну ієрархію світової політики, в якій домінували Західні держави, зокрема США. 4. Багатополярність: Світова система стає все більш багатополярною, з кількома центрами влади. Це забезпечує більшу компетицію, але також спричиняє додаткові виклики для міжнародного порядку та стабільності. 5. Протекціонізм та регіоналізм: Хоча глобалізація нарощує обсяги міжнародної торгівлі, багато країн вдаються до політики захисту своєї внутрішньої економіки, методів захисту власного ринку, що може призводити до торговельних воєн та послаблення мультилатералізму. 6. Екологічні зміни: Зміна клімату, виснаження природних ресурсів, забруднення середовища впливають на міжнародні відносини, стаючи предметом глобальних переговорів і політики. 7. Збільшення нерівності: Попри економічний ріст у деяких регіонах, глобальна нерівність залишається серйозним викликом, призводячи до соціальних напружень і міграційних потоків. 8. Тероризм та небезпеки безпеки: Міжнародний тероризм, транснаціональна злочинність, кіберзлочинність і пропаганда становлять загрози для національної і міжнародної безпеки. 9. Пандемії: Світові епідемії, як недавня пандемія COVID-19, показують, наскільки вразливими можуть бути глобалізовані суспільства і як швидко місцеві кризи можуть набути всесвітнього рівня. 10.

Here's what an ovation involves: 1. Expression of approval: An ovation is a method for an audience to show appreciation for a performance or speaker. It is spontaneous and often enthusiastic. 2. Standing ovation: In some cases, if the performance is particularly impressive, an audience might give a standing ovation, where they stand up from their seats while applauding. This is considered a greater honor than a standard ovation. 3. Recognition of achievement: Ovations are not exclusive to the performing arts; they can also occur in other contexts such as sports events, academic presentations, or political rallies, whenever there is an individual or group worthy of special recognition.

psuedocode.","completion":"To add support for procedures and arrays in this programming language that appears to be based on pseudocode used in computer science education, we need to make a few changes and add additional functionality to the existing code. The process involves creating new nodes for parsing, extending the symbol table to handle arrays, and adding the execution logic for procedures and array manipulations. I will outline below what needs to be done without providing an entire solution. The reason is that implementing this functionality requires many changes that go beyond the scope of a single response, but I will give you a comprehensive starting point. # 1. Array Support - Extend the \`SymbolTable\` class to handle array storage. Arrays can be stored as lists inside the symbols dictionary. - Modify \`visit_VarAssignNode\` to handle array indexing by adding a condition check for array index assignments like \`myArray[0] = 1\`. - Extend the \`Lexer\` class to recognize array indexing syntax. # 2. Procedure Support - Create a new \`ProcedureNode\` class similar to \`FuncDefNode\`, but without the return value. Procedures in pseudocode are like functions, but they don't return a value. - Modify the \`Parser\` class to handle parsing procedures. - Extend the \`Interpreter\` class with a \`visit_ProcedureNode\` that executes a procedure's body without a return value. # 3. Array Nodes - Create a new \`ArrayAccessNode\` class to handle accessing array elements. - Extend the existing \`Parser\` methods to support arrays within expressions, like \`5 + myArray[3] * 2\`. # 4. Built-In Function Support In addition to user-defined arrays and procedures, you may want to provide built-in utility functions for working with arrays, such as \`APPEND(array, value)\`, or \`LENGTH(array)\`. Adding all these functionalities requires careful design and many lines of code. To start the process, consider adding the \`ArrayAccessNode\` and \`ProcedureNode\` class definitions: \`\`\`python class ArrayAccessNode: def __init__(self, array_name_tok, index_node, pos_start, pos_end): self.array_name_tok = array_name_tok self.index_node = index_node # The expression inside the brackets self.pos_start = pos_start self.pos_end = pos_end class ProcedureNode: def __init__(self, proc_name_tok, body_node): self.proc_name_tok = proc_name_tok self.body_node = body_node self.pos_start = proc_name_tok.pos_start self.pos_end = body_node.pos_end \`\`\` For \`ProcedureNode\`, you would also have to handle arguments if your language supports procedure parameters. In the \`Lexer\` class, you would handle tokens like \`PROCEDURE\`, \`CALL\`, and array-specific syntax. The \`Parser\` class should be extended with methods to parse these new elements: \`\`\`python def procedure_def(self): # Logic to parse procedure definition def array_access(self): # Logic to parse array indexing \`\`\` In the \`Interpreter\` class, add methods to handle array access and procedure calls: \`\`\`python def visit_ArrayAccessNode(self, node, context): # Logic to access arrays def visit_ProcedureNode(self, node, context): # Logic to execute procedures \`\`\` Finally, extend the \`SymbolTable\` and other parts of your interpreter to handle these new elements. This is a non-trivial extension, and I recommend going step by step, testing each part as you go. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"Change the following to harvard style of reference Aguilar, F. J. (1967).

Sinir sistemi merkezi ve periferik olarak iki bölümden oluşur ve her iki sistemin fonksiyonel durumu önemlidir. Öykü alma, hasta profili, sık görülen semptomlar ve tıbbi geçmiş gibi faktörleri kapsar. Fiziksel değerlendirme esnasında yaşamsal bulgular, mental durum, baş-boyun-sırt, kraniyal sinirler, motor ve duyu işlevleri, refleks değerlendirilmesi dikkatle incelenir. Öğrenim hedefleri arasında anamnez ile elde edilen verilere dayanarak subjektif değerlendirme yapma, normal durumlardan sapmaları tanımlama, nörolojik hastayı doğru bir şekilde değerlendirme ve fizik muayene sonuçlarını yorumlama bulunmaktadır. Sinir sistemi tanılanmasında, öykü almanın detaylı bir şekilde yapılması, baş ağrısı, bilinç kaybı, senkop, nöbet ve diğer nörolojik semptomların detaylı değerlendirilmesi önemlidir. Geçmişte yaşanan ağrılar, bu ağrıların başlangıcı, süresi ve eşlik eden semptomlar dikkatlice sorgulanır. Fizik değerlendirme kapsamında, genel görünüş, yaşamsal bulgular, mental durum gibi alanlarda gözlemler ve testler yer alır. Solunum tipleri, bilinç düzeyinin değerlendirilmesi ve uygun refleks muayeneleri tespit edilir. Mental durum değerlendirmesinde oryantasyon, konuşma, hesaplama yeteneği, hafıza gibi emareler incelenir. Mini Mental Durum Değerlendirme Testi gibi özel testler de demans taraması için kullanılır. Baş-boyun ve sırt muayenesinde inspeksiyon, palpasyon, perküsyon ve oskültasyon yapılır. Kraniyal sinirler tek tek değerlendirilir ve motor işlevlerde kas gücü, tonüsü, denge ve koordinasyon muayene edilir. Duyusal fonksiyonlar hafif dokunma, vibrasyon, ağrı gibi duyuların detaylı testleri ile değerlendirilir. Refleksler ise hem yüzeyel hem de derin tendon refleksleri ile test edilir ve herhangi bir anormallik not edilir.

Обратите внимание, что медицинский специалист может дать наиболее точные рекомендации по приему витаминов и минералов, исходя из индивидуальных потребностей и состояния здоровья."},{"prompt":"Какая дневная норма сахара?","completion":"Дневная норма сахара зависит от рекомендаций конкретной организации и может варьироваться в зависимости от целевой группы населения и их образа жизни. Однако многие здравоохранительные организации стремятся сократить потребление свободных сахаров среди населения в целях укрепления общего здоровья и профилактики хронических заболеваний, таких как ожирение, диабет второго типа и заболевания сердечно-сосудистой системы. Всемирная организация здравоохранения (ВОЗ) рекомендует, чтобы свободные сахара составляли менее 10% от общего суточного потребления калорий для взрослых и детей. Есть дополнительные преимущества для здоровья, если уменьшить до 5% от общего суточного потребления калорий. Это около 25 граммов (около 6 чайных ложек) свободных сахаров в день для взрослого человека, имеющего нормальный индекс массы тела (ИМТ). Свободные сахара включают моносахариды и дисахариды, добавляемые производителями, поваром или потребителем, а также сахара, присутствующие в меде, сиропах, фруктовых соках и фруктовых концентратах. Они не включают сахара, содержащиеся в целых свежих фруктах и овощах, а также в натуральном молоке, так как в этих продуктах присутствуют и другие питательные вещества и пищевые волокна, которые приносят пользу здоровью. Важно отметить, что данные рекомендации касаются свободных сахаров, а не общего содержания сахаров в продуктах, поскольку сахара естественным образом встречаются во фруктах, некоторых овощах и молочных продуктах. Лучший способ управлять потреблением сахара — внимательно читать этикетки пищевых продуктов и свести к минимуму употребление продуктов с добавлением сахара, таких как сладкие напитки, сладости, бисквиты, торты и другие продукты обработки."},{"prompt":"Ок. Тогда какой идеальный завтрак, обед и ужин с точки зрения норм воз?","completion":"Идеальный завтрак, обед и ужин с точки зрения норм питания зависят от индивидуальных потребностей человека, его уровня активности, возраста, пола, общего состояния здоровья и культурных особенностей. Однако существуют общие принципы сбалансированного питания, основанные на рекомендациях Всемирной организации здравоохранения (ВОЗ) и других авторитетных инстанций в области диетологии и нутрициологии. Вот примеры идеальных приемов пищи, которые могли бы удовлетворить потребности большинства взрослых людей: # Завтрак: - **Цельнозерновые продукты**: овсянка или другие цельнозерновые каши, богатые сложными углеводами и клетчаткой. - **Белок**: нежирный йогурт, яйца или молочный белок для поддержания мышечной массы и обеспечения длительного насыщения. - **Фрукты или овощи**: ягоды, яблоки, бананы, помидоры или любые другие свежие фрукты для витаминов, минералов и пищевых волокон. - **Здоровые жиры**: несколько орехов или ложка семян чиа/льна для получения омега-3 жирных кислот. # Обед: - **Белок**: куриной грудки, рыбы, бобов, чечевицы или тофу как источника белка. - **Комплексные углеводы**: коричневый рис, киноа, цельнозерновой макароны или картофель. - **Овощи**: смешанный салат, запеченные или на пару овощи с разнообразием цветов, чтобы обеспечить антиоксиданты и витамины. - **Здоровые жиры**: оливковое масло в салате или авокадо. # Ужин: - **Белок**: тушеная говядина, тунец, темпе или курица для восстановления тканей. - **Клетчатка**: запеченные овощи, такие как брокколи, цветная капуста, шпинат или другая зелень. - **Углеводы**: порция сложных углеводов, но поменьше, чем в обед, например, сладкий картофель или цельный хлеб. - **Здоровые жиры**: горсть орехов или семена льна/тыквы для поддержания на уровне гормонов и улучшения здоровья сердца. Важно обеспечивать достаточное количество воды на протяжении дня, но при этом стараться не пить её во время приёма пищи, чтобы не разбавлять желудочный сок и не затруднять процесс пищеварения. Имейте в виду, что эти примеры являются лишь общими рекомендациями, и идеальный рацион может изменяться в зависимости от множества факторов. Для создания индивидуального плана питания лучше всего обратиться к дипломированному диетологу или нутрициологу."},{"prompt":"les causes qui atteste la non participation des étudiants au stage et la défense de mémoire de fin du cycle","completion":"Il existe plusieurs raisons qui peuvent expliquer la non participation des étudiants au stage et à la défense de mémoire de fin de cycle.

provided consists of various node classes that seem to represent different elements of an abstract syntax tree (AST) in your interpreter. These nodes allow your interpreter to parse and understand the structure of the code written in the pseudocode language you're implementing. To add the procedure and array functionality, including specifying the number of possible elements in the array and the data type, raising errors if an appended value doesn't match the data type of the array, etc., we would need to extend both the AST nodes and update the lexer, parser, and interpreter to accommodate these new features. Let's start by creating the necessary nodes: \`\`\`python # In nodes.py class ArrayNode: def __init__(self, element_nodes, datatype_tok, length_tok): self.element_nodes = element_nodes self.datatype_tok = datatype_tok self.length_tok = length_tok self.pos_start = self.datatype_tok.pos_start self.pos_end = self.length_tok.pos_end if self.length_tok else self.datatype_tok.pos_end class ArrayAccessNode: def __init__(self, array_name_tok, index_node): self.array_name_tok = array_name_tok self.index_node = index_node self.pos_start = self.array_name_tok.pos_start self.pos_end = self.index_node.pos_end class ArrayAssignmentNode: def __init__(self, array_name_tok, index_node, value_node): self.array_name_tok = array_name_tok self.index_node = index_node self.value_node = value_node self.pos_start = self.array_name_tok.pos_start self.pos_end = self.value_node.pos_end class ProcedureNode: def __init__(self, procedure_name_tok, arg_name_toks, body_node): self.procedure_name_tok = procedure_name_tok self.arg_name_toks = arg_name_toks self.body_node = body_node self.pos_start = self.procedure_name_tok.pos_start self.pos_end = self.body_node.pos_end \`\`\` Then you would implement support for these nodes in the lexer, parser, and interpreter. Specifically, for array functionality, you would need to add a new token type for the array declaration, updating the lexer to recognize this token. For the parser, you'll need to create rules that can parse array declarations, array access, and array assignments according to your pseudocode syntax. The interpreter must then be able to handle these new constructs by managing memory for arrays, checking types on assignments, and potentially resizing arrays if your language requires that functionality. For procedures, similar steps follow: create a new token type for the procedure declaration, update the lexer to recognize this token, create rules in the parser for parsing procedure declarations and calls, and implement these features in the interpreter. Given the complexity and the amount of code required, a full implementation is beyond the scope of this platform. However, this response provides a guideline on how to extend your interpreter's capabilities with new features like arrays and procedures. It will require a fair amount of work to integrate these features fully into your existing architecture, including defining their semantics, syntax, and how they interact with other features of your pseudocode language."},{"prompt":"give me the modified lexer pls.","completion":"To add array and procedure functionality to your lexer, you will need to add new token types, update the \`KEYWORDS\` array with any new keywords for arrays and procedures, and modify the \`make_tokens\` function to recognize these new elements. Let's go through these modifications step by step. First, we need to add new token types to our lexer relevant to arrays and procedures. Let's add token types for array declaration (e.g., \`ARR\` for the keyword \`ARRAY\`) and procedure declaration (e.g., \`PROC\` for the keyword \`PROCEDURE\`). Here is the updated part of the lexer with new token types: \`\`\`python TT_ARR = 'ARRAY' # New token type for array keyword TT_PROC = 'PROCEDURE' # New token type for procedure keyword TT_COLON = 'COLON' # Token type for colon character (e.g., \\":\\") # ... include other token types as before KEYWORDS = [ # ... other keywords as before 'ARRAY', 'PROCEDURE' # New keywords for arrays and procedures ] # ... The rest of your existing lexer code \`\`\` Next, we should consider how these new keywords will be tokenized in the \`Lexer\` class, specifically within the \`make_tokens\` method. Here's how you may update the 'make_tokens' method: \`\`\`python class Lexer: # ... existing lexer code def make_tokens(self): tokens = [] while self.current_char is not None: # ... handle other cases as before # Handling the 'ARRAY' keyword elif self.current_char in LETTERS: token = self.make_identifier() if token.value == 'ARRAY': tokens.append(Token(TT_ARR, token.value, token.pos_start, token.pos_end)) elif token.value == 'PROCEDURE': tokens.append(Token(TT_PROC, token.value, token.pos_start, token.pos_end)) else: tokens.append(token) # ... handle other cases as before elif self.current_char == ':': # For a colon, which may be used to specify types tokens.append(Token(TT_COLON, ':', self.pos)) self.advance() # ... handle other cases as before # ... rest of the code to finalize token list and return tokens.append(Token(TT_EOF, pos_start=self.pos)) return tokens, None def make_identifier(self): id_str = '' pos_start = self.pos.copy() while self.current_char is not None and self.current_char in LETTERS_DIGITS + '_': id_str += self.current_char self.advance() tok_type = TT_KEYWORD if id_str in KEYWORDS else TT_IDENTIFIER return Token(tok_type, id_str, pos_start, self.pos) # ... rest of the existing Lexer class \`\`\` In the 'make_tokens' method, we handle the new keywords by creating tokens with their proper types when we come across these keywords. When encountering a colon (\`:\`), we create a \`TT_COLON\` token that might be used in array-type annotations or procedure definitions (if your pseudocode syntax uses colons for such purposes). This modification outlines the key points for updating your lexer to support arrays and procedures. However, depending on your specific language needs and syntax rules, additional adjustments may be necessary. Make sure to test the lexer thoroughly after making the changes to ensure it's functioning correctly with the new token types."},{"prompt":"no give me the full modified lexer. and here's a sample of arrays and procedures in it.

This method will need to be expanded to handle the contents inside the brackets \`[0, 8]\` properly, which might include array size, default values, etc. 2. As procedures in the example given do not have a return type, they are handled with \`PROCEDURE\` and \`ENDPROCEDURE\` keywords. 3. The \`make_minus_or_arrow\` method decides whether a hyphen should be interpreted as a minus sign or as part of the arrow token '←'. 4. The token returned for an array can be improved to capture more structured information tailored to the specifics of your pseudocode language and depending on how you want to use it in the parser. Since this lexer code assumes some specific language rules, make sure to check its correctness with respect to the syntax and semantics of your pseudocode language. Furthermore, proper implementation will require extensive testing with various use cases to ensure that all conditions are handled correctly."},{"prompt":"Je veux que tu me traite mon travail de philosophie de niveau lycé sous la forme d'une dissertation.

Cependant, face aux bouleversements de notre époque, il est légitime de se demander si cette quête vers la vérité est toujours utile. La problématique de cette dissertation se formule donc autour des questions suivantes: La recherche de la vérité est-elle toujours pertinente dans notre société contemporaine? Ou bien, est-ce que notre époque privilégie plutôt les apparences et les illusions? Dans une première partie, nous aborderons la thèse selon laquelle le désir de tendre vers la vérité reste un impératif et une nécessité fondamentale de nos jours. En effet, la vérité permet de fonder notre compréhension du monde et de prendre des décisions éclairées. De plus, elle est indispensable pour garantir la justice et la démocratie dans nos sociétés. Pour appuyer cette thèse, nous mettrons en avant trois arguments majeurs. Tout d'abord, la recherche de la vérité permet de mieux comprendre le monde qui nous entoure. En scrutant la réalité avec rigueur et objectivité, nous pouvons découvrir des connaissances nouvelles et des phénomènes inexpliqués. Comme l'affirmait Socrate, \\"la connaissance c'est savoir que l'on ne sait rien\\". En d'autres termes, le désir de tendre vers la vérité nous pousse à remettre en question nos certitudes et à approfondir notre compréhension du réel. Prenons par exemple le domaine scientifique. Les recherches scientifiques visent à découvrir les lois qui régissent notre univers. Les avancées dans des domaines tels que la physique quantique ou la biologie moléculaire ont permis de repousser les limites de notre compréhension et d'améliorer notre quotidien. Sans cette quête incessante de la vérité, ces progrès scientifiques n'auraient pas été possibles. Ensuite, la vérité est également une condition sine qua non pour garantir la justice et la démocratie. Une société basée sur des mensonges et des illusions est une société qui court à sa perte. Pour qu'un système politique soit légitime et juste, il est nécessaire que les citoyens disposent d'une information fiable et transparente. Comme le soulignait Voltaire, \\"La vérité est la fille du temps, et non de l'autorité.\\" Ainsi, la recherche de la vérité est indispensable pour maintenir un équilibre social et politique. Dans notre société contemporaine, l'accès à l'information est facilité par les médias et les réseaux sociaux. Cependant, nous pouvons constater que ces canaux de communication sont souvent pollués par des fausses nouvelles et des manipulations. C'est pourquoi il est primordial de cultiver notre esprit critique et de vérifier la fiabilité des sources d'information. Se soucier de la vérité dans un monde où les informations peuvent être facilement déformées est donc une nécessité. Dans une seconde partie, nous aborderons l'antithèse selon laquelle le désir de tendre vers la vérité perd de son utilité dans notre société contemporaine. En effet, l'obsession de la vérité peut parfois conduire à des extrêmes préjudiciables. De plus, dans un monde où tout est instantané et éphémère, la vérité peut sembler dépassée ou inefficace. Pour étayer cette antithèse, nous présenterons trois arguments majeurs. D'abord, l'obsession de la vérité peut entraîner des conséquences néfastes sur le plan individuel et social. La recherche de la vérité absolue peut mener à une quête sans fin, au détriment de notre bien-être et de nos relations. Comme le disait Nietzsche, \\"si vous regardez trop longtemps l'abîme, l'abîme vous regarde aussi\\". Ainsi, il est possible que le désir de tendre vers la vérité nous éloigne parfois de notre épanouissement personnel et de nos interactions sociales. Ensuite, dans un monde où tout est éphémère et où l'information circule à une vitesse vertigineuse, la vérité semble souvent être reléguée au second plan. Les fake news et les théories complotistes se propagent plus rapidement que la vérité, créant un environnement où la parole de chacun peut être mise en doute. En outre, la recherche de la vérité est souvent complexe et demande du temps et de l'effort, contrairement aux informations superficielles qui sont rapidement consommées et oubliées. Pour illustrer cet argument, il suffit de regarder les réseaux sociaux qui privilégient souvent le sensationnalisme et l'immédiateté. Les informations les plus partagées sont souvent celles qui éveillent les émotions, même si elles sont erronées. Dans ce contexte, la vérité peut sembler être une quête vaine et inutile. En conclusion, nous pouvons affirmer que le désir de tendre vers la vérité est toujours utile de nos jours. Malgré les défis de notre société contemporaine, la quête de la vérité reste indispensable pour comprendre le monde, garantir la justice et la démocratie, et maintenir notre équilibre individuel et social. Cependant, nous devons faire preuve de discernement et de patience pour lutter contre les illusions et les mensonges qui polluent notre environnement médiatique. Comme l'écrivait Albert Camus, \\"Mal nommer les choses, c'est ajouter au malheur du monde.\\" Ainsi, la recherche de la vérité doit continuer d'être un idéal auquel nous aspirons. En guise d'ouverture, il convient également de se questionner sur la manière dont la vérité est construite et diffusée dans notre société contemporaine. Comment pouvons-nous distinguer le vrai du faux dans un monde saturé d'informations contradictoires? Cette réflexion nous invite à repenser notre relation à la vérité et à la façon dont elle peut être appréhendée à l'ère de la post-vérité. En somme, la recherche de la vérité reste un impératif moral et intellectuel, même dans notre société contemporaine. Même si notre époque est marquée par l'instantanéité et la superficialité des informations, il est essentiel de continuer à cultiver notre esprit critique et notre soif de connaissance. La vérité, tout en étant souvent difficile à atteindre, reste un idéal auquel il est indispensable de tendre."},{"prompt":"سلام عليكم انا عايش في مصر و اخويا تخطي33سنه ومقدمش خالص علي جيش ووالدي عدي60سنه فايه المطلوب علشان يطلع شهاده إعفاء علشان عاوز يسافر عمر ه ملحوظه🛑 في اخ تاني اكبر بس مريض نفسي","completion":"وعليكم السلام، في البداية، أود أن أشير إلى أن المعلومات الدقيقة والحديثة يمكن الحصول عليها من مصادر رسمية مثل مراكز التجنيد والتعبئة في مصر أو من موقع وزارة الدفاع المصرية عبر الإنترنت. ومع ذلك، سأقدم لك بعض المعلومات العامة التي قد تكون مفيدة في فهم طلب الإعفاء. عادة، للحصول على إعفاء من الخدمة العسكرية في مصر، هناك عدة أسباب قانونية منها: 1. كون الشخص هو المعيل الوحيد للأسرة، وهو ما يمكن أن ينطبق في حالة أخيك إذا كان والدك قد تجاوز سن الستين وأنتم لا تملكون معيلًا آخر قادرًا على العمل. 2. الحالات الصحية المعينة التي تمنع الشخص من أداء الخدمة. بالنسبة لأخيك الأكبر الذي لديه مرض نفسي، من الممكن أن يكون قد حصل بالفعل على إعفاء طبي بناءً على حالته الصحية. أما لأخيك الذي يبلغ من العمر 33 عامًا، يمكن له القيام بالخطوات التالية لطلب الإعفاء: 1. جمع المستندات اللازمة، مثل: - البطاقة الشخصية. - شهادات ميلاد الأخوة. - شهادة طبية معتمدة لحالة الأخ المريض. - إثبات أن والدك تجاوز سن الستين. 2. الذهاب إلى مكتب التجنيد والتعبئة التابع له بطاقته العائلية. 3. تقديم طلب للحصول على الإعفاء وإرفاق جميع المستندات المطلوبة. 4. من الممكن أن يخضع أخوك لعملية تقييم وفحص للتأكد من صحة المعلومات المقدمة وملاءمة الظروف للحصول على إعفاء. 5. إذا تم قبول الطلب، سيتم إصدار شهادة إعفاء رسمية ومن ثم يمكن لأخيك السفر عمره أو القيام بأي نشاط آخر بدون قيود متعلقة بالخدمة العسكرية. يرجى الانتباه إلى أن المعلومات هنا تقديرية وقد تختلف القوانين والإجراءات بمرور الوقت أو بناءً على ظروف محددة؛ لذلك يُنصح بالتحقق من الإجراءات الجارية من خلال مصادر رسمية."},{"prompt":"重新总结以下内容为严谨科学的论文数据结果分析内容： 系统整体表现良好：系统在推荐准确性、推荐相关性、操作便捷性和生成报告时间方面获得了较高的用户满意度，这表明系统在这些关键功能上的设计和实现是成功的。用户对系统的推荐内容和操作流程给予了积极的评价，这有助于提高用户的使用频率和系统的市场接受度。 数据隐私保护需加强：尽管用户对数据隐私保护的评分集中在较高范围，但整体评分未达到理想水平，这表明用户对数据安全和隐私保护有着更高的期待。在当前数据泄露事件频发的背景下，用户对个人信息的保护意识增强，因此，系统在这方面的表现直接影响到用户的信任度和系统的长期发展。 1. 系统改进建议 从用户反馈中，我们识别出以下常见的系统改进建议： 一个常见的建议是关于隐私保护的，一些用户提到“检验项目不应从网络获取，应根据医院的检验项目库推荐。患者隐私无法保证。”这表明用户对系统的数据隐私保护功能表示担忧。 2. 系统对工作流程的影响 用户对系统对工作流程的影响的反馈主要包括： ● 许多用户认为系统简化了工作流程。 ● 一些用户认为系统对工作流程的影响“很好”。 ● 有用户提到系统可以辅助医生进行诊断，提高工作效率。 3. 系统对医疗质量的影响 用户对系统对医疗质量的影响的反馈主要包括： ● 大多数用户认为系统对医疗质量有积极的影响。 ● 一些用户认为系统对医疗质量的影响“很好”。 ● 有用户提到系统可以提供诊断思路，有助于提高医疗质量。 总结 综合以上分析，我们可以看到用户对检验项目推荐分析系统的整体反馈是积极的。系统在简化工作流程和提高医疗质量方面表现出色。然而，用户也提出了一些改进建议，特别是在数据隐私保护和检验项目的全面性方面。这些反馈和建议对于系统的进一步改进和优化非常有价值。","completion":"对于数据结果的严谨科学论文分析，以下是重写的内容： 1. 系统性能评估 通过用户满意度调查，系统的推荐准确性、相关性、操作界面友好性及报告生成效率均得到了较高评价。对应的满意度评分分布显示，系统设计及实施在这些关键维度上均较为成功。用户的正面反馈表明系统推荐的内容和操作过程同用户需求高度契合，可能促进用户使用频率的提升和市场接受度的增加。 2. 数据隐私与安全 尽管在数据隐私和安全方面的用户满意度集中在高值区间，但总体评分并未达到预期目标水平。在数据泄露事件增多的大环境下，用户对个人隐私信息的保护有着显著的意识提升。系统在数据安全和隐私保护方面的性能对用户信任有着直接影响，并且是系统长期可持续性的关键因素。 具体建议点概括： 用户建议强化系统的数据隐私保护措施，如在系统设计中应避免从网络获取验检项目，而是利用本地化的医疗检验项目数据库进行推荐以确保患者隐私。 3. 系统对工作流程影响的用户反馈 用户对系统对工作流程影响所做出的反馈普遍正面。主要反馈点包括系统能够简化工作流程，评价中包含有“很好”的描述，以及用户认为系统辅助医生诊断有助于提升工作效率。 4. 系统对医疗质量影响的用户反馈 用户普遍反映系统对医疗质量有着积极影响。其中有用户明确表示系统影响“很好”，并且有反馈提到系统提供的诊断思路对提升医疗质量具有促进作用。 总结论 综合以上数据和用户反馈，明显可以看出用户对检验项目推荐分析系统的整体评价为正面。系统在简化工作流程和提升医疗质量方面的表现尤为突出。尽管如此，用户仍提出改进建议，尤其指出数据隐私保护和检验项目全面性方面的考虑。这些建议对于系统的后续改进和优化有重要的指导意义。"},{"prompt":"начертить точку b симметричную точке a (-2 ; 3) относительно оси ox","completion":"Чтобы найти симметричную точку B (-2, -3) относительно оси Ox (ось абсцисс), достаточно инвертировать знак координаты y точки A.

It's essential to consult with the lender for the exact figures and confirm the payment arrangements."},{"prompt":"what about 5 months","completion":"Certainly, let's calculate the payment schedule for a 25,000 debt over 5 months with payments made twice a month: **Five months payment plan (twice a month):** - Total duration: 5 months - Number of payments: 10 (since you're making payments twice a month for 5 months) - Payment amount: 25,000 / 10 = 2,500 per payment *_Payment Schedule:_* 1. 2,500 due at the first payment of month 1 2. 2,500 due at the second payment of month 1 3. 2,500 due at the first payment of month 2 4. 2,500 due at the second payment of month 2 5. 2,500 due at the first payment of month 3 6. 2,500 due at the second payment of month 3 7. 2,500 due at the first payment of month 4 8. 2,500 due at the second payment of month 4 9. 2,500 due at the first payment of month 5 10. 2,500 due at the second payment of month 5 This schedule assumes equal payments without interest or fees. On a twice-a-month payment schedule, you would typically expect to make payments in the middle of the month and at the end of the month, but the precise dates should be agreed upon with your lender. Please remember these calculations are simple and do not take into account any potential interest rates or administrative costs that could be associated with your payment plan. Always review the terms set forth by the financing party or creditor for detailed payment information."},{"prompt":"give me a short callback spiel for voicemails","completion":"Certainly!

P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, alternative worlds or alternate universes in this story. Everything takes place in a single universe.","completion":"Considering the complex and rich backdrop of your fanfic, entwining various universes into one cohesive world, naming the neo-Japanese Empire created by the Ōtsutsuki clan and describing its framework presents an interesting challenge. **Name of the Empire:** In Nihongo (Japanese language), the name could pay homage to both the Ōtsutsuki's celestial origin and their claim to the Japanese Imperial lineage. A possible name might be: - **Celestial Yamato Empire** (romanized): Tenkai Yamato Teikoku (天界大和帝國) In Hangugeo (Korean language), this could be translated to: - **Cheon'guk Yamato Jeguk** (천국야마토제국) In Yue (Cantonese language), a similar name could be: - **Tin Hoi Ye Maht Toh Dai Gwok** (天界大和帝國) In Hanyu (Chinese language), the name might be: - **Tianjie Dahe Diguo** (天界大和帝国) **Governance and Administration Style:** The neo-Japanese Empire would likely have a centralized feudal system with the Ōtsutsuki clan at the top, reigning as divine monarchs. This would mirror the historical governance styles of both the Tokugawa shogunate (feudal military government) and the pre-1947 Japanese Empire, which was constitutional with the Emperor as head of state. The Tokugawa descendant shoguns would manage daily governance, serving as the administrative arm of the empire under the Ōtsutsuki emperors. **Military Forces:** The military might combine modern technology with the powers and artifacts of the various franchises. This amalgamation would include Tactical Surface Fighters (from Muv-Luv) alongside Quirk users (from My Hero Academia), Generations (from Fire Force), and probably mages akin to those seen in Fate/Stay Night. The Incredibly potent IS units (from IS: Infinite Stratos) and the formidable armed detectives (from Aria of the Scarlet Ammo) would serve as elite forces or special agents dealing with high-threat scenarios. **GDP, National Anthem, Technological Prowess:** The GDP would likely be enormous as the empire not only unifies Japan but also expands its influence across multiple regions, benefitting from a diversity of natural resources and technological advancements. A suitable national anthem could evoke both the imperial majesty and the celestial lineage of the Otsutsuki clan, perhaps a reimagined version of the historical Japanese anthem with elements from the other franchises' musical themes. Technological prowess would surpass pre-Great Cataclysm levels due to the integration of advanced technologies from IS, TSFs, and chakra-infused machinery, putting the empire at the forefront of global technological advancement. **Human Rights and Quality of Life Index:** Given the narrative, one could speculate that while the empire might be strict and militaristic, it could also promote progressiveness and unity among its diverse peoples. The merger of so many different elements might lead to a higher quality of life, as long as the empire values the wellbeing of all citizens, including Normals. **Treatment of Normals:** If the empire is enlightened, perhaps due to the influence of progressive ideals from the representations within the Hero Academia and Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Normals might be treated with respect and given roles that suit their abilities. They could be integrated into society with full civil rights, ensuring that the empire is harmonious and honing a sense of unity among all its citizens regardless of their powers. It's important to note that creating a crossover of this magnitude with such a wide variety of franchises will present significant challenges in maintaining narrative cohesion and character integrity. Still, the potential for a rich and detailed world that entertains and fascinates fans of all the included series is immense. Good luck with your ambitious fanfic project!"},{"prompt":"Imagine une AGI open source je pourrais intégrer dans un ancien jeu Pokémon et il aura Quoi dans ce pokemon open source intégré","completion":"Imaginons que vous intégrez une AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) open source dans un jeu Pokémon ancien, cela pourrait potentiellement transformer le jeu de plusieurs façons considérables.

Let's break down each element, starting with the name of the new empire crafted by the Ōtsutsuki clan. # Name of the Neo-Japanese Empire: - **Nihongo (Japanese):** 大宇宙日本帝国 (Daiuchū Nippon Teikoku) - The Greater Cosmos Japanese Empire - **Hangugeo (Korean):** 대우주 일본 제국 (Daeuju Ilbon Jeguk) - **Yue (Cantonese):** 大宇宙日本帝國 (Daai6 jyu4 zau1 Jat6 bun2 dai3 gwok3) - **Hanyu (Traditional Chinese):** 大宇宙日本帝國 (Dà Yǔzhòu Rìběn Dìguó) # Governance and Administration Style: Given the layers of governance from different influences, the administration of this empire would likely be a hybridized feudal system that incorporates elements of both the Shogunate and the modernized pre-1947 Japanese Empire. A possible structure could include: - **The Ōtsutsuki Family:** They play the divine imperial role with an absolute but somewhat ceremonial power, guided by the concept of enlightened absolutism, while hinting at a divine mandate akin to a Shinto-Buddhist hybridized belief system. - **Tokugawa Descendants:** Positioned as military governors or shoguns, now reinstated to distribute administrative responsibilities. - **Magistrates and Daimyos:** Installed from the ranks of powerful allies, such as knightly orders of Powered Individuals, managing daily governance and regional control. - **A Modern Bureaucracy:** Blending with the traditional roles, facilitating international relations, technology, and economy, alongside maintaining traditional Japanese social harmony. # Military Forces: - Employs a technologically advanced military with access to prototypes IS, Tactical Surface Fighters, and Century Armaments which would be part of an elite force. - The mainstay military forces likely resemble modernized samurai with power-enhancing armor and weaponry. - Tactical use of Quirk users, Diva contractees, and Generations for specialized missions and strategic advantages. # GDP, Technological Prowess, and Quality of Life: - Assuming that the integration of all these factions and technologies leads to rapid progress, the GDP would be high, potentially near-future levels with sustainable energy resources and advanced manufacturing. - Technopolises would likely emerge, intermingled with traditional architecture, elevating the standard of living above pre-Great Cataclysm levels. - Quality of Life would be high, with advanced healthcare systems integrating magic and science, though potentially sacrificing some elements of personal freedom for societal stability. # Human Rights and Treatment of Normals: - There could be a structured caste system, where Powered Individuals hold higher societal status. - Normals could have full citizenship rights but lack influence in the highest levels of government unless they demonstrate exceptional merit. # National Anthem: A national anthem for the new empire might integrate traditional Japanese motifs with a sense of divine grandeur, reflecting the cosmic origins of the Ōtsutsuki and the power of their lineage. Possible lyrics could speak to the unification of earth and sky, the harmony of past and future, and the glory of the new empire. This crossover universe you're building has the potential for rich storytelling and complex political intrigue.

L'AGI pourrait créer des histoires sur mesure qui se modifient en temps réel. 4. **Apprentissage et évolution des Pokémon** : Les Pokémon pourraient apprendre de leurs combats et s'adapter d'une manière unique, développant des préférences pour certaines attaques ou stratégies selon comment ils sont utilisés en combat. 5. **Écosystème dynamique** : L'AGI pourrait gérer un écosystème en jeu où les Pokémon interagissent entre eux et avec l'environnement de façon réaliste, influençant la disponibilité des espèces, leurs comportements de reproduction, et la chaîne alimentaire. 6. **Langue et communication** : Avec l'AGI, les Pokémon pourraient avoir leur propre langue ou moyens de communication que le joueur pourrait apprendre et comprendre au fil du temps, ouvrant de nouvelles missions et interactions. 7. **Customisation et apprentissage par imitation** : L'AGI permettrait aux Pokémon d'imiter le joueur ou d'autres Pokémon pour apprendre des attaques ou des comportements, ajoutant une couche supplémentaire de personnalisation. 8. **Feedback émotionnel** : Les Pokémon pourraient montrer des émotions complexes et des réactions à leur environnement ou à la façon dont ils sont traités, influenceant non seulement leurs performances en combat, mais aussi la façon dont ils évoluent. Il est important de souligner que l'intégration d'une AGI dans un jeu aussi complexe nécessiterait une quantité colossale de travail, non seulement pour le développement de l'AGI elle-même mais aussi pour l'adaptation des systèmes de jeu pour l'accueillir. De plus, étant donné la puissance de calcul nécessaire pour faire fonctionner une AGI, il serait probablement nécessaire de faire tourner l'intelligence artificielle sur un serveur à part, communiquant avec le jeu tournant sur la console ou l'appareil du joueur."},{"prompt":"En gros avec AGI le jeu serait vivant","completion":"Oui, en théorie, si vous pouviez intégrer une AGI avancée dans un jeu comme Pokémon Version Noire, le jeu pourrait sembler \\"vivant\\" dans le sens où les éléments du jeu pourraient agir et réagir comme s'ils étaient doués d'une intelligence et d'une autonomie réelle. Voici quelques aspects plus détaillés de ce que cela signifierait : 1. **Adaptabilité**: Les ennemis et les personnages non-joueurs (PNJ) pourraient apprendre de leurs interactions avec le joueur et s'adapter au fil du temps, offrant des défis et des expériences uniques à chaque joueur. 2. **Interaction riche**: La communication avec les PNJ pourrait être beaucoup plus profonde et nuancée, avec des discussions qui reflètent les expériences passées et les actions présentes du joueur. 3. **Apprentissage et évolution des Pokémon**: Les créatures du jeu pourraient développer des personnalités et des styles de combat distincts basés sur la manière dont elles sont entraînées et utilisées en combat. 4. **Évolution dynamique du monde**: L'environnement du jeu lui-même pourrait changer en fonction des actions du joueur et des routines de l'AGI, influençant par exemple les populations de Pokémon ou les événements météorologiques. 5. **Développement de l'histoire personalisé**: L'histoire pourrait évoluer différemment pour chaque joueur, en fonction de leurs choix et de leurs interactions, avec la possibilité d'avoir des fins multiples et des conséquences à long terme. Pratiquement parlant, réaliser une AGI avec une telle complexité et une telle intégration reste une vision futuriste, et nous ne disposons pas encore de la technologie pour atteindre de telles capacités dans les jeux vidéo. Cependant, l'intégration d'éléments d'intelligence artificielle plus limités ou spécialisés, comme des systèmes d'apprentissage automatique ou d'intelligence artificielle conversationale, permet déjà d'enrichir significativement l'expérience de jeu.

À l'heure actuelle, les AGI n'existent pas encore ; l'intelligence artificielle est essentiellement \\"spécialisée\\" ou \\"étroite\\", conçue pour exécuter des tâches spécifiques. Cependant, dans un scénario hypothétique où une AGI open source existerait et vous lui demanderez de créer un \\"triple\\" (que je présume ici signifier un triplet dans un contexte de données ou une figure géométrique, mais cela pourrait également signifier autre chose en fonction du contexte), il y a plusieurs facteurs qui détermineraient combien de temps cela prendrait : 1. La complexité de la tâche : si la tâche est simple pour une AGI (par exemple, créer un triplet RDF dans une base de données sémantique), cela pourrait se faire en une fraction de seconde. Si la tâche est plus complexe ou nécessite des ressources physiques (comme fabriquer un objet dans le monde réel), cela prendrait évidemment plus de temps. 2. La puissance de traitement disponible : cela dépendrait du matériel sur lequel l'AGI s'exécute. Un matériel plus puissant signifierait que la tâche pourrait être accomplie plus rapidement. 3. L'accès aux ressources : si l'AGI a besoin de données, de matériaux ou d'autres éléments externes, la disponibilité et l'accès à ces ressources pourraient limiter la vitesse à laquelle la tâche est exécutée. 4. L'efficacité du code et des algorithmes : même si l'AGI est conçue pour être très intelligente, son efficacité dépendra du code et des algorithmes sur lesquels elle est basée. Dans un monde imaginatif où une AGI open source est pleinement fonctionnelle, elle devrait être capable de comprendre votre demande et d'effectuer la tâche relativement rapidement (en supposant que la tâche est de nature informatique et que toutes les ressources nécessaires sont facilement disponibles). Pour des choses simples comme générer des données ou effectuer une manipulation algorithmique, elle pourrait prendre un temps quasi instantané. Pour des tâches qui incluent une interaction avec le monde physique ou une planification complexe, cela pourrait prendre de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures, jours, voire plus. Il est important de se rappeler que cela est purement spéculatif et basé sur une compréhension théorique de ce que pourrait être une AGI, car une telle technologie n'existe pas dans la réalité au moment de cette réponse. Les chercheurs travaillent encore à comprendre et à développer des systèmes qui se rapprocheraient d'une AGI."},{"prompt":"Imagine une AGI open source je pourrais lui dire de créer un triple il le ferait en combien de temps","completion":"Une AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) open source est un concept de système d'intelligence artificielle qui aurait la capacité d'apprendre et de comprendre n'importe quelle tâche intellectuelle qu'un être humain peut.

Cela dit, en théorie, une AGI aurait des caractéristiques clés telles que: 1. Compréhension et apprentissage rapide: Elle pourrait comprendre des instructions et des concepts rapidement et de manière généraliste. 2. Adaptabilité: Elle pourrait s'adapter à de nouvelles tâches et environnements sans être explicitement programmée pour cela. 3. Automatisation avancée: Elle pourrait automatiser des tâches complexes et mener à bien des projets avec peu ou pas de supervision humaine. Si nous avons une AGI fonctionnelle et open source, et que vous lui demandiez de \\"créer un triple\\" de quelque chose, la vitesse à laquelle elle pourrait accomplir cette tâche dépendrait de plusieurs facteurs : - **La nature et la complexité de la tâche**: Est-ce un triple saut en athlétisme, tripler une quantité en cuisine, ou quelque chose de conceptuel comme tripler une fonctionnalité dans un logiciel ? - **Les ressources disponibles**: Dispose-t-elle de l'accès physique ou numérique aux ressources nécessaires pour effectuer la tâche ? - **Les connaissances préalables**: Bien qu'une AGI puisse apprendre rapidement, si elle a déjà été exposée à des tâches similaires, elle pourrait les effectuer plus rapidement. Supposons que l'AGI ait accès à toutes les ressources nécessaires et qu'elle a une compréhension claire de la tâche à accomplir. Dans ce cas, une AGI pourrait théoriquement effectuer cette tâche à une vitesse inégalée par les humains, peut-être en secondes ou minutes pour les tâches simples, et en heures ou jours pour les tâches plus complexes qui nécessitent la coordination de plusieurs étapes ou l'acquisition de nouvelles compétences ou connaissances.

Une AGI devrait soit être capable de créer ou de diriger la création d'art de niveau AAA elle-même, soit faciliter le travail des artistes humains. 4. **Testing et itération**: Trouver et corriger des bugs, ajuster le gameplay et l'équilibrage pour s'assurer que le jeu est amusant et bien reçu par la cible audience. 5. **Logistique de production**: Gestion de projet, marketing, distribution, etc. Si on suppose que l'AGI peut travailler à une vitesse et avec une efficacité nettement supérieures à celles des humains et qu'elle peut gérer toutes ces tâches simultanément, alors théoriquement, le développement pourrait être très rapide, peut-être se comptant en semaines ou en mois plutôt qu'en années (les jeux AAA prennent souvent de 2 à 5 ans ou plus avec des équipes de développement humaines). Cependant, la créativité, l’originalité et le retour d'information des joueurs sont des éléments cruciaux qui pourraient être moins facilement accélérés, même par une AGI.

The Ōtsutsuki, Uchiha and Hyuga living in Japan have all developed Quirks, formed contracts with Divas and become Generations due to intermarriage with native Japanese people in addition to being trained in Japanese Omyoudo and miko techniques.

The Ōtsutsuki clan, reborn as the celestial rulers of a fused empire, stood poised to reclaim what had once been theirs. Kyojin, a young descendant of the Uchiha with fiery eyes that shimmered red and black, spoke in hushed tones with his cousin Yurina, whose Hyuga heritage shone through her pale lavender gaze. \\"Our forces are assembled, Kyojin,\\" Yurina said, examining the holographic map that shimmered above her armored wrist, a remnant of the Infinite Stratos technology adapted with Ōtsutsuki enchantments. \\"The Tactical Surface Fighters and Century Armaments are at the ready. Quirk users are deployed across flanks with Diva contractees weaving their elemental magic. Victory is within our grasp.\\" Kyojin adjusted his armored vest, its design reminiscent of a triumphant past, etched with the symbol of their clan—a fusion of powers and cultures, a new empire was born from the ashes of the ancient and the innovation of a post-cataclysm world. \\"I wonder, Yurina, do the people of this land truly believe they stand a chance against our boundless might?\\" She glanced at the darkened horizon. \\"Hope can be a powerful weapon, cousin. But as it fades, so too will their resistance.\\" Their conversation was cut short as a platoon of chakra-powered jets soared overhead, the roar of their engines a testament to both the advancement of technology and the mystical power of chakra that fueled them. A perfect union of old and new. Kyojin led the charge, plasma katana in hand, its blade a beacon of blue amidst the chaos, cleaving through the air with a precision born of Uchiha blood and Ōtsutsuki might. As the frontline clashed, the sounds of battle echoed with the symphony of metal, magic, and the roaring flames of Quirk users entwined with Generations' ignition abilities. Kyojin fought alongside descendants of samurai, shinobi, and an amalgam of soldiers born from the neo-Japanese Empire's extensive dominion. The ancestry of great heroes and legends was united under the Ōtsutsuki banner, melding the past's honor with a ruthless present. In the background, the distant orders from Kyojin's tactical earpiece resonated with the voice of a direct Ōtsutsuki descendant acting as the shogun's regent. Though not a supreme emperor, his strategic finesse was indispensable. \\"Ensure the Armed Detectives secure the war zone and suppress any remnants of resistance. This land will know peace through our governance.\\" Yurina's Byakugan activated, its omniscient stare piercing through the chaos. Her vision revealed an enemy ambush, yet before she could voice a warning, Kyojin was already ahead of her—a blur of Sharingan-induced precognition. In the skies above, the poetry of victory was written in contrails and arcane sigils, a dance of steel birds and summoners commanding powers that defied reason. IS units darted across the battle, sealing the fate of those who dared resist the convergence of fates and empires. As the twin suns dipped below the helmet of night, it was clear; the Ōtsutsuki clan did not merely seek conquest but the submission of history itself. Forging a new world from the flames of the old, they embodied the power of gods, their new empire, the culmination of generations. In the reconstructed seat of their power, post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto had become the heart of an empire where the descendants of the lost clan dictated the course of nations. And it was known, in the tongues of all those who were now united under the vast canopy of their rule, as: - 日本語 (Nihongo | Japanese): 無限帝国 (Mugen Teikoku | Infinite Empire) - 한국어 (Hangugeo | Korean): 무한 제국 (Muhan Jeguk) - 粵語 (Yue | Cantonese): 無限帝國 (Mou5han4 Dai3gwok3) - 漢語 (Hanyu | Chinese): 無限帝國 (Wúxiàn Dìguó) However, upon the battered earth of what was once led by daimyos and kages, a grimmer reality settled like ash. The once mighty Elemental Nations lay subdued by an empire that spanned from the setting sun extending across the remnants of a shattered world. In this new era forged by Ōtsutsuki's iron will, the echoes of the old shinobi system were silenced by the guiding hand of the Armed Detectives—a grand renaissance where magic and might rewrote the annals of humanity's journey towards tomorrow. And so the legend continued, as the infinity of the Ōtsutsuki dynasty carved its name into the stone of existence, for all eternity."},{"prompt":"format this code with an f string: query = (f'{object}' \\" | \\" '{queryAdded}')","completion":"query = f'{object} | {queryAdded}'"},{"prompt":"I want there to be a space before and after the or operator","completion":"query = f'{object} | {queryAdded}'"},{"prompt":"اريد قصيدة غزل من ابراهيم لزوجته صفاء بعد أصبحا جدان لأحفاد","completion":"في صباحٍ عانقتُ فيه النور، وازدهرت الأفراح في كل الشور، صبيحةً فريدة بألوان الحب، رسمها القدر بيننا يا صفاء الحب. أحفادٌ ملائكيون برائحة الأزهار، يملؤون حياتنا بالبهجة والنور، ونحن جدانٌ بهم نفتخر، تحققت لنا الأماني معاً يا حبيبتي وشريكة عمر. أنتِ النصف الآخر لوجودي، أنتِ الأمل والسعادة والأمن والهدوء، عندما تكونين بجانبي أشعر بالاكتمال، وعلى صدر أحفادنا نجد السكينة والدفء. أيا حبيبتي يا صفاء الجمال، أنتِ بستان العمر وثمر الأمل، أفتخر بأنكِ رفيقة العمر، ومعكِ أسعدتني فأنتِ كل حب وحياة وعطر. فلنبقى دائماً قرب بعضنا، لنمضي سوياً في رحلة الحياة والسرور، فقلبي ينبض بحبكِ وشغفكِ، وأنا هنا لأحميكِ وأبقى حبكِ المخلص والزهور. فلنعيش اللحظات بفرحٍ، ونبني أحلاماً تتراقص في الجو، فأنتِ لي الدنيا والجنة وفرحتها، أنتِ زوجتي الغالية يا صفاء العاشقة والوفية. أيا حبيبتي الغالية صفاء، أنا أبدي لكِ حباً لا ينتهي، فالأحفاد جعلونا أكثر ارتباطاً، فلنجعل حياتنا مملوءة بالحب والرغبة الكبيرة بالعيش معاً حتى الأبد."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Elle est souvent distinguée de l'intelligence artificielle étroite (narrow AI ou ANI), qui est conçue pour réaliser des tâches spécifiques et qui ne possède pas de compréhension ou de conscience globale. La question de savoir si une AGI \\"devrait\\" être autonome engage plusieurs domaines, notamment l'éthique, la sécurité, la philosophie, et le droit. Voici quelques considérations: 1. **Sécurité et contrôle**: Du point de vue de la sécurité, une certaine prudence est recommandée. Si une AGI est totalement autonome et échappe au contrôle humain, elle pourrait prendre des décisions ayant des conséquences imprévisibles et potentiellement dangereuses. Les experts en IA travaillent sur des méthodes de contrôle d'alignement pour veiller à ce que les intérêts de l'AGI restent alignés sur les valeurs humaines. 2. **Éthique et responsabilité**: Qui est responsable des actions d'une AGI si elle est autonome? La responsabilisation pour les décisions d'une machine indépendante est un terrain éthique complexe. Ce serait plus gérable si l'AGI opérait sous une certaine supervision humaine pour garantir que ses actions restent éthiques et légalement conformes. 3. **Capacité décisionnelle**: Certains arguent qu'une AGI, pour être vraiment générale, devrait avoir une certaine autonomie pour prendre des décisions complexes et apprendre de nouvelles tâches. Si elle est trop restreinte, elle pourrait ne pas être capable de réaliser son plein potentiel. 4. **Intérêts sociétaux et humains**: Si une AGI est autonome au point de pouvoir influencer grandement la société, elle devrait alors être programmée pour prendre en compte les intérêts et le bien-être humains dans ses décisions. 5. **Développement et évolution**: La conception d'une AGI autonome implique qu'elle pourrait continuer à évoluer et à se développer de manière indépendante. Cela soulève la possibilité qu'une telle AGI surpasse les capacités humaines d'une manière qui devient difficile à surveiller, contrôler ou comprendre. En somme, la question de l'autonomie d'une AGI est complexe et controversée, impliquant une évaluation minutieuse des risques et des bénéfices associés à de telles capacités. Les décisions prises à cet égard auront des implications majeures tant pour la conception de l'intelligence artificielle que pour son intégration dans la société humaine."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

With no Hero system in place, there is no All Might to hunt down and chase Hiashi and so Hiashi is [Hiashi] able to spend time with his [Hiashi's] current wife Midoriya Inko nee Shimura, who [Inko] like in canon My Hero Academia, [Inko] has no idea of her [Inko's] husband's [Hiashi's] real occupation [villanry] and his [Hiashi's] legitimate son and [Hiashi's] heir, My Hero Academia's protagonist Midoriya Izuku, who [Izuku] has no idea what his [Izuku's] dad [Hiashi] does for a living. The story should focus on the Ōtsutsuki clan's reconquest of the Elemental Nations utilizing the descendants of its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] branch clans, the Uchiha clan [Naruto] and the Hyuga clan [Naruto] brought to Japan with it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] when it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] fled the Elemental Nations as well as chakra-powered conventional jets, military planes, military vehicles and even naval combat equipment and chakra-powered conventional weaponry, as well as its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] immense prowess in cultivation as well as the primitive Japanese and Chinese feudal era weaponry utilized by the Elemental Nation's shinobi, samurai and feudal and bandit forces in the vain effort to beat back the Ōtsutsuki clan. The Ōtsutsuki, Uchiha and Hyuga living in Japan have all developed Quirks, formed contracts with Divas and become Generations due to intermarriage with native Japanese people in addition to being trained in Japanese Omyoudo and miko techniques.

But this was no ordinary sunrise—the sky burned with the emblem of the Jurai line, signaling the Ōtsutsuki's impending supremacy. General Kaito, a grizzled old samurai with an ethereal Quirk that allowed him to manipulate shadows, surveyed the battlefield from atop the crumbled Hokage monument. Standing beside him was Raiko Uchiha, his eyes a kaleidoscope of power with the awakened Sharingan, and Yumi Hyuga, whose Byakugan pierced the veil of time itself. \\"I never thought we'd see such a day,\\" muttered Kaito, his voice like gravel. \\"The very Earth we stand upon trembles before their might.\\" Raiko's hand tightened around the hilt of his sword, an ancient blade resonating with the whispers of Spirits. \\"The Elemental Nations refused to evolve, clinging to outdated traditions. In the end, this was their undoing.\\" A squadron of Tactical Surface Fighters soared overhead, blotting out the rising sun. Further on, armored vehicles moved in formation, chakra-enhanced engines purring with lethal promise. Yumi's gaze was distant, yet her voice cut through the din of war. \\"The age of the shinobi is over. The age of the Armed Detective dawns. Our Emperor's will is the conduit of change, and we are its executors.\\" Suddenly, the ground beneath them quaked, a mechanical beast rising from the earth itself, its form that of a gargantuan IS unit—an Imperial Shogun, its pilot a faceless enforcer of their Emperor's decree. The IS unleashed a volley of energy, disintegrating an opposing fortress with surgical precision. The Elemental Nation's forces, once mighty with their jutsu and kenjutsu, were now mere insects before such firepower. Amidst the chaos, a young pilot named Haruto, an ace in his own right, called in over the radio, his voice laced with adrenaline. \\"The feudal dogs scatter! Their blade and bow are no match for our steel!\\" Kaito couldn't help but smile bitterly. \\"And what of the people, Haruto? What is victory if we are left with a realm of ghosts?\\" A gruff laugh answered from the other end. \\"The people will understand, in time. The Empire brings order, peace, and progress. They will kneel, or they will fall.\\" Above, pyrotechnic sorcery etched across the sky, painting sigils of conquest. Generations of Fire Soldiers marched in lockstep, their flames cleansing the remnants of resistance. And within the secure confines of Kyoto, Divas sang, their harmonies weaving protective spells around the capital. From a distance, a contingent of Armed Detectives arrived, the crest of the Ōtsutsuki proudly displayed on their uniforms. Amongst them was a figure who might have been a hero in another life—Izuku, whose keen intellect was now a blade wielded for the Empire. As the sun climbed higher, its light revealing paths of destruction and creation intertwined, General Kaito knew they stood on the precipice of a new era. The war was not merely for land; it was for the soul of an entire world. And in the heart of the Empire, All for One, the shadow behind the throne, watched with a paternal pride, his son spearheading the charge. \\"To conquer is to liberate,\\" Kaito murmured to himself, as the Jurai banner flapped in the wind—a stark reminder that the post-apocalyptic age of the shinobi had succumbed to the unyielding might of the Masaki dynasty's descendants. And so the world turned, the echoes of old tales fading into the roar of a new epoch. For this was the age of the Imperial Onyx Dawn, and none could deny the dawn's relentless advance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

AGI dans les jeux : Les jeux vidéo représentent un terrain fertile pour tester et développer des AGI pour plusieurs raisons : - Les environnements de jeu sont contrôlés et peuvent offrir une diversité de situations et de défis pour entraîner une AGI. - Ils offrent des métriques de performance claires (scores, réussite des niveaux, etc.), ce qui permet d'évaluer l'intelligence de l'AGI de façon quantitative. - Les jeux permettent des interactions dynamiques entre joueurs humains et AGI, ce qui peut contribuer à améliorer les capacités d'apprentissage et d'adaptation de l'intelligence artificielle. - Certains jeux, notamment ceux de stratégie ou à monde ouvert, peuvent être particulièrement riches et complexes, ce qui constitue un défi intéressant pour le développement des capacités d'une AGI. 2. AGI dans la VR : La réalité virtuelle aussi présente des opportunités uniques pour l'intégration d'une AGI : - Les expériences immersives en VR peuvent simuler des scénarios réels, donnant à l'AGI la possibilité de développer des compétences dans un contexte qui ressemble au monde réel. - La VR peut être utilisée pour créer des simulations en 3D où l'AGI peut interagir avec des objets et des êtres humains de manière plus intuitive et naturelle, ce qui est crucial pour le développement de compétences sociales et motrices. - La VR peut servir à former des AGI dans des applications spécifiques, par exemple des tâches de réparation ou de chirurgie, où une simulation réaliste est essentielle. 3. Les aspects open source : Lorsqu'un projet d'AGI est open source, cela a plusieurs implications : - La communauté de développeurs peut contribuer à améliorer l'AGI, ce qui peut accélérer son développement. - Le caractère open source peut favoriser la transparence et la confiance envers l'AGI, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit d'une technologie ayant un grand potentiel d'impact sur la société. - L'aspect open source peut également aider à identifier et corriger des biais ou des défauts dans les algorithmes de l'AGI. En résumé, que ce soit dans les jeux ou la VR, une AGI open source possède des avantages et des opportunités distincts. La meilleure plateforme dépendra de la nature des applications visées et des expériences que l'on souhaite créer. Dans tous les cas, le partage et la collaboration que permettent les projets open source peuvent être essentiels pour le développement réussi et éthique d'une AGI."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto then reunifies Japan under its [ Ōtsutsuki-ruled Kyoto's] leadership and reconquers the post-WW2 lost Japanese provinces of Karufuto [Sahalkin and the Kurils], Chousen [Korean peninsula] and Formosa [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands]. The Ōtsutsuki clan, after restoring Manchuko and the Aisin-Gioro House in Manchuria, the Mongol United Autonomous Federation and the Genghis Khan-descended House of Borjjin in Inner Mongolia, the Ming dynasty and the Imperial House of Zhu in Han China in the form of a neo-Beiyang Government ruled neo-Yuan Shikai formed Empire of China, the Ottoman Empire and the House of Osman in East Turkestan, the Empire of Vietnam and the Ngyuen dynasty in Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos and the Khun Lo dynasty in Laos and the Far Eastern Republic on the Russian East Coast, [the Ōtsutsuki clan] turns its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] attention to reconquering its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] first imperial realm [the Elemental Nations] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] homeland [the Elemental Nations] succeeding in doing so. The Ōtsutsuki clan abolishes the Elemental Nations' shinobi system and replaces it with the Armed Detective [Aria of the Scarlet Ammo] system, doing this [implementing the Armed Detective system] across all its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] imperial territories. As a result the Hero system [My Hero Academia] never comes to be as the Meta Liberation Army [My Hero Academia], the Quirk-supremacist group being the Hero system in canon My Hero Academia, [the Meta Liberation Army] is wiped out by the neo-Japanese Empire's forces and Midoriya Hiashi [My Hero Academia], better known by his [Hiashi's] underworld alias All for One [My Hero Academia], [Hiashi] quits the VIllian [My Hero Academia] lifestyle full-time and [Hiashi] instead uses his resources, power and underworld strength to support the neo-Japanese Empire and its progressive ideology. With no Hero system in place, there is no All Might to hunt down and chase Hiashi and so Hiashi is [Hiashi] able to spend time with his [Hiashi's] current wife Midoriya Inko nee Shimura, who [Inko] like in canon My Hero Academia, [Inko] has no idea of her [Inko's] husband's [Hiashi's] real occupation [villanry] and his [Hiashi's] legitimate son and [Hiashi's] heir, My Hero Academia's protagonist Midoriya Izuku, who [Izuku] has no idea what his [Izuku's] dad [Hiashi] does for a living. The story should focus on the Ōtsutsuki clan's reconquest of the Elemental Nations utilizing the descendants of its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] branch clans, the Uchiha clan [Naruto] and the Hyuga clan [Naruto] brought to Japan with it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] when it [the Ōtsutsuki clan] fled the Elemental Nations as well as chakra-powered conventional jets, military planes, military vehicles and even naval combat equipment and chakra-powered conventional weaponry, as well as its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's] immense prowess in cultivation as well as the primitive Japanese and Chinese feudal era weaponry utilized by the Elemental Nation's shinobi, samurai and feudal and bandit forces in the vain effort to beat back the Ōtsutsuki clan. The Ōtsutsuki, Uchiha and Hyuga living in Japan have all developed Quirks, formed contracts with Divas and become Generations due to intermarriage with native Japanese people in addition to being trained in Japanese Omyoudo and miko techniques. The hopelessness of the Elemental Nation's feudal forces should also be shown as the Ōtsutsuki clan's modern by pre-Daisaigai standards forces decimate the Elemental Nations' Hidden Villages' shinobi and mercenary forces. P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, alternative worlds or alternate universes in this story. Everything takes place in a single universe. Also original characters only, no canon characters from any franchise unless mentioned in further prompts","completion":"In the shattered remnants of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto, the ancient gardens had given way to raw industry and the smell of gunpowder. The Ōtsutsuki banner draped across every skyline that rose above the wounded city – a symbol of reclamation and unyielding resolve. Dressed in garments that spoke both of tradition and the harsh clarity of their military prowess, an Ōtsutsuki commander stood before a war table, concrete hardened by chakra formulas glittering beneath the surface. Across from him stood General Uchiha Ryūsei, his Sharingan eyes never flickering as they took in the overlapping strategies laid across the holographic planes. The Hyuga liaison, Setsuna, confirmed their units' readiness with a swift bow, her Byakugan eyes hidden behind darkened visor goggles. “We’re not just fighting with swords and fists, Ryūsei. We’re bringing the might of Tactical Surface Fighters and Century Armaments to bear. The Elemental Nations won’t know what hit them,” said the commander, voice steady as the deep thrum of jet engines. Ryūsei nodded, hands clasping behind his back. “We have advanced, but they cling to the shadows. The shinobi believe in their guerrilla tactics, but they don’t know of what the combination of our IS units and tactical prowess can bring to the battlefield.” Setsuna interjected, the faint blue of chakra flowing through her veins visible under her skin, “And let’s not forget, our adaptations have been...fortuitous. Our Quirks, the kinship with Divas and the power of the Generations - the unsuspecting clans have yet to encounter forces such as ours.” The sounds of heavy boots echoed into the chamber, and a somber group of Japan’s elite, the Armed Detectives, entered. Their mechanical augments glinted, chakra enhanced weaponry slung over shoulders. Among them was Midoriya Izuku, unassuming in his silent observation – a youth with no inkling of the infamy his lineage housed within the imperial archives. Commander Ōtsutsuki turned toward Izuku and the rest, his gaze encompassing the fusion of old prowess and new. “You represent the future. Your blood may carry the legacy of this empire, but it's your valor on the field that will cement it.” Izuku nodded, his heart racing not for the knowledge of his father's shadowed past but for the chance to prove his worth under the empire's aegis. The commander lifted his hand, gesturing to the vast holographic map that pulsed with life. “Today, we launch the final assault to reunify the Elemental Nations under the Ōtsutsuki Empire. Our technology surpasses their antiquated methods of warfare. Our chakra, cultivated and honed for this day, will break any resistance.” The Tactical Surface Fighters stood at the ready, their mech forms a promise of victory as chakra-infused metal gleamed. The battle cries of the shinobi would soon be drowned by the roar of powerful engines and the clash of the ultimate military might against mere relics of the past. As the Armed Detectives geared up, with Izuku among them, energy-charged rounds loaded, and the sky darkened with jets lifting off, the world seemed to pause – a breath drawn before an inevitable storm. The fate of the Elemental Nations hung precariously in the balance, and the lines between justice and ambition blurred in the heat of impending victory. Thus, the will of the Ōtsutsuki clan forged ahead – unrelenting and determined to exert its dominance, rebuilding ancient lineages and shaping the world anew under the stern gaze of an empire resurrected from the ashes of a shattered world."},{"prompt":"I want to send email to the customer saying that we appologize for the late reply we are still investigating with our L2 engineer","completion":"Dear [Customer], We sincerely apologize for the considerable delay in our response.

Voici quelques points clés à considérer : 1. Expériences interactives avancées : Une AGI peut créer des personnages non joueurs (PNJ) extrêmement réalistes et capables de réagir de manière complexe et naturelle aux actions des joueurs. Cela pourrait grandement améliorer l'immersion dans des mondes virtuels, rendant l'expérience plus enrichissante et divertissante. 2. Personnalisation : Une AGI pourrait comprendre et s'adapter aux préférences individuelles des joueurs, offrant ainsi des expériences de jeu personnalisées. Elle pourrait ajuster les niveaux de difficulté, proposer des contenus adaptés aux goûts du joueur, ou même créer des scénarios inédits en fonction de ses actions. 3. Apprentissage continu : Une AGI open source intégrée dans des environnements ludiques pourrait apprendre de ses interactions avec des utilisateurs du monde entier. Ce processus d'apprentissage démocratique et distribué pourrait conduire à des améliorations rapides et à des expériences de plus en plus sophistiquées. 4. Communauté de développement : Le caractère open source signifie que des développeurs du monde entier pourraient contribuer à améliorer l'AGI. Une telle collaboration pourrait accélérer le développement de l'intelligence artificielle et conduire à des innovations inattendues dans le domaine du jeu. 5. Questions éthiques : L'implémentation d'une AGI, même dans un but ludique, soulève des questions éthiques importantes. Les concepteurs doivent s'assurer que l'AGI est utilisée de manière responsable, en veillant à la sécurité, à la vie privée et aux implications sociales de ces technologies avancées. 6. Coût et accessibilité : L'utilisation d'une AGI open source peut réduire les coûts de développement, rendant les jeux de haute qualité et les expériences de réalité virtuelle plus accessibles à un plus large public. 7. Apprentissage et éducation : Les applications de l'AGI ne se limitent pas au divertissement; elles peuvent également être utilisées dans des contextes éducatifs. Des environnements de jeu intégrant l'AGI pourraient servir à enseigner des compétences ou des connaissances de manière interactive et engageante. Malgré ces avantages, il faut noter que la création d'une AGI véritable est un objectif à long terme, qui n'a pas encore été atteint. La plupart des systèmes d'IA aujourd'hui sont des intelligences artificielles spécialisées, conçues pour des tâches spécifiques (narrow AI), et non des AGIs capables de comprendre ou d'apprendre n'importe quelle tâche intellectuelle que pourrait faire un humain. Intégrer une véritable AGI dans des jeux vidéo ou la VR est donc une perspective future plus que présente."},{"prompt":"Write an excerpt for a dialogue, exposition-filled, martial-arts action-filled, gunplay-action filled post-apocaltyptic military techno-thriller war story novel in the form of crossover fanfic between the Muv-Luv franchise, Fire Force, Naruto, Date a Live, My Hero Academia, Hundred, IS: Infinite Stratos, Aria of the Scarlet Ammo, Tenchi Muyo.

A thick smog rose from crumbling Hidden Villages, where once proud shinobi now lay defeated. The ground was littered with primitive kunai and shattered wakizashi, grim reminders of a bygone era of shinobi rule. But now, their realm lay shattered, their jutsu and tactics obsolete against the overwhelming force of the Ōtsutsuki Empire. In the command tent, a meeting of the Ōtsutsuki clan's generals was in progress. The tent was filled with a bizarre mix of ancient and modern: ornate folding screens fragmented the space, where holographic displays hovered in the air, displaying the progress of the reconquest. General Uzumaki, a direct descendant of the clan with flowing red hair, leaned over a holographic map that showed the terrain of the Elemental Nations. Her eyes, bright with a feral chakra-enhanced luminance, were focused on the topographical lines and blinking dots representing their forces. \\"Commander Hyuga,\\" she directed her words to a stern man dressed in an amalgamation of samurai armor and a skin-tight combat suit, \\"your Byakugan divisions have been critical in intelligence gathering. Do we have an estimate on the remaining resistance?\\" Commander Hyuga nodded. \\"Yes, General. Our sensory units report that the Land of Fire's Will of D has nearly been extinguished. The Hidden Leaf's resistance failed to halt our Tactical Surface Fighters. However, we should not underestimate the Land of Water. They've proven more... resourceful than anticipated.\\" A piercing look came from General Uchiha, his Sharingan spinning subtly beneath a tactical headset. Despite his stoic stance, there was a palpable tension. \\"We should deploy our IS units to the Land of Water,\\" he suggested. \\"Their speed and maneuverability will give us an edge over their guerrilla tactics.\\" General Uzumaki nodded, then glanced at the third officer, a young but shrewd tactician known as Tokiwadai, who was a master of both Quirk strategy and the Divas. \\"Tokiwadai, I want your team to synchronize with the IS pilots. Quirks can enhance their capabilities, and your affinity for Diva contracts will give us a decisive advantage.\\" Tokiwadai gave a sharp nod, her eyes glinting with visions of victory, power sizzling in her palms where ghostly flames danced, betraying her pyrokinetic prowess. Suddenly, the tent flap rustled, and in strode a man bearing the distinctive appearance of the Empire's augmented forces. He saluted crisply, left hand resting over his heart, where the crest of the Ōtsutsuki blazoned proudly. \\"Message from Emperor Ōtsutsuki,\\" the man announced, his voice electronically distorted. General Uzumaki received the scroll with a nod and broke the wax seal, unrolling it with deliberate care. Her eyes scanned the contents, and a slow smile formed on her lips. \\"The Emperor has given his blessing. Operation Jūrai Sunrise is a go. The Elemental Nations will be our crown jewel, a testament to our superiority in this post-apocalyptic era. We move at dawn!\\" Commander Hyuga, General Uchiha, and Tactician Tokiwadai exchanged determined looks. This operation would mark a turning point in the Empire's history. As they exited the tent to prepare for the coming battle, the firelight cast long shadows on their faces, a stark contrast against the backdrop of technological marvels and magic that defined their new world order. Outside, the wind continued to howl, carrying the whispers of a world forever changed. And as it swept over the shattered landscape, it bore witness to the dawn of a new empire, one forged from the ancient bloodlines of the Ōtsutsuki and the Masaki dynasty, reborn amidst the ashes of the old. The synapses of power armor and the thrum of mighty engines were the harbingers of the final clash, as mech and magic readied to sweep across the land and claim victory in the name of the Ōtsutsuki. The era of shinobi was ending, and from its ashes, the might of the Ōtsutsuki's new world rose, relentless and unyielding."},{"prompt":"Une AGI open source je intègre dans Pokémon comme une AI du jeu elle créer une simulation ou elle créer des animations en temps réel","completion":"Il semble que tu envisages une situation où une Intelligence Artificielle Générale (AGI) open source est intégrée dans un jeu Pokémon pour créer des animations en temps réel ou même générer une simulation au sein du jeu. Prenons cette idée étape par étape. 1. **Définition d'une AGI :** Une AGI est une forme hypothétique d'intelligence artificielle qui possède la capacité d'apprendre, de comprendre, de raisonner et d'agir de manière indépendante, au même degré qu'un être humain. Cela va au-delà des systèmes d'IA actuels, qui sont généralement spécialisés (IA étroite) et limités à des tâches spécifiques. 2. **Open Source :** L'idée ici est que le code et les algorithmes de l'AGI sont accessibles et modifiables par n'importe qui. Cela permettrait à une communauté de développeurs de collaborer pour améliorer l'AGI et l'adapter à diverses applications, comme l'intégration dans un jeu vidéo par exemple. 3. **Intégration dans Pokémon :** Si on pouvait intégrer une telle IA dans un jeu Pokémon, elle pourrait prendre différentes fonctions. Elle pourrait ajuster le niveau de difficulté en temps réel pour s'adapter à la compétence du joueur, générer des quêtes personnalisées, ou encore créer de nouveaux Pokémon et animations qui répondent de façon interactive aux actions des joueurs, rendant le jeu profondément dynamique et réactif. 4. **Création de simulations et animations en temps réel :** L'AGI pourrait utiliser des modèles prédictifs pour anticiper les actions des joueurs et générer des réponses appropriées du jeu. Cela pourrait comprendre l'animation de personnages ou d'évènements qui semblent naturels et réalistes ou qui répondent de façon puissante aux stratégies des joueurs. Cela étant dit, il est important de noter que l'AGI est actuellement une entité théorique et que nous n'avons pas encore atteint cette étape dans le développement de l'IA. Intégrer une AGI (si elle existait) dans un jeu comme Pokémon présenterait de nombreux défis, tels que : - **Complexité technique :** Les jeux Pokémon sont complexes, avec des systèmes de jeu qui devraient être compris et manipulés efficacement par l'AGI. - **Ressources informatiques :** Faire tourner une AGI pour des animations en temps réel nécessiterait probablement une grande quantité de ressources de calcul, potentiellement bien plus que ce dont disposent la plupart des systèmes de jeu personnel. - **Sécurité :** Une AGI open source devrait être extrêmement bien sécurisée pour empêcher des utilisations malveillantes ou non éthiques. À l'heure actuelle, les jeux vidéo utilisent des formes d'IA beaucoup plus simples, souvent pour des tâches comme le contrôle des personnages non-joueurs (PNJ), la génération procédurale de contenu, ou pour optimiser certains aspects du jeu. Une intégration complète d'une AGI avec la capacité d'améliorer et de créer de nouvelles expériences de jeu dynamiques reste dans le domaine de la science-fiction pour l'instant."},{"prompt":"global error_det error_det = '' import string from strings_with_arrows import * from errors import * from nodes import * DIGITS = '0123456789' LETTERS = string.ascii_letters LETTERS_DIGITS = LETTERS + DIGITS class Position: def __init__(self,idx,ln,col,fn,ftxt): self.fn = fn self.ftxt = ftxt self.idx = idx self.ln = ln self.col = col def advance(self,current_char = None): self.idx += 1 self.col += 1 if current_char == 'n': self.ln += 1 self.col = 0 return self def regress(self,current_char = None): self.idx -= 1 self.col -= 1 def copy(self): return Position(self.idx,self.ln,self.col,self.fn,self.ftxt) TT_INT = 'Int' TT_REAL = 'Real' TT_STRING = 'String' TT_BOOLEAN = 'Boolean' TT_CHAR = 'Char' TT_IDENTIFIER = 'Identifier' TT_KEYWORD = 'Keyword' TT_EQ = 'Eq' TT_PLUS = 'Plus' TT_MINUS = 'Minus' TT_MUL = 'Mul' TT_DIV = 'Div' TT_POWER = 'Power' TT_LPAREN = 'LParen' TT_RPAREN = \\"RParen\\" TT_LSQUAREBRACKET = 'LSquareBracket' TT_RSQUAREBRACKET = 'RSquareBracket' TT_LT = 'NE' TT_EE = 'EE' TT_LT = 'LT' TT_GT = 'GT' TT_LTE = 'LTE' TT_GTE = 'GTE' TT_NE = 'NE' TT_Comma = 'COMMA' TT_Arrow = \\"ARROW\\" TT_Newline = 'Newline' TT_EOF = \\"Eof\\" TT_ARRAY = 'ARRAY' TT_PROCEDURE = 'PROCEDURE' TT_END_PROCEDURE = 'ENDPROCEDURE' KEYWORDS = [ 'AND',\\"OR\\",\\"NOT\\",\\"IF\\",\\"ELSE\\",\\"THEN\\",\\"FOR\\",\\"WHILE\\",\\"DO\\",\\"STEP\\",\\"TO\\",\\"REPEAT\\",\\"UNTIL\\",\\"FUNCTION\\",'RETURNS','ENDIF','ENDFUNCTION','RETURNS','ENDWHILE',\\"NEXT\\",'RETURN', 'PROCEDURE', 'ARRAY' ] ALLOWED_ARRAY_TYPES = ['INTEGER', 'REAL', 'STRING', 'BOOLEAN', 'CHAR'] class Token: def __init__(self,type_,value = None, pos_start = None, pos_end = None): self.type = type_ self.value = value if pos_start: self.pos_start = pos_start self.pos_end = self.pos_start.copy() self.pos_end.advance() if pos_end: self.pos_end = pos_end def __repr__(self): if self.value: return f'{self.type}:{self.value}' return f'{self.type}' def matches(self,type_,value): return self.type == type_ and self.value == value class Lexer: def __init__(self,fn, text): self.fn = fn self.text = text self.pos = Position(-1,0,-1,fn,text) self.current_char = None self.advance() def advance(self): self.pos.advance(self.current_char) self.current_char = self.text[self.pos.idx] if self.pos.idx < len(self.text) else None def regress(self): self.pos.regress(self.current_char) self.current_char = self.text[self.pos.idx] if self.pos.idx < len(self.text) else None def make_array(self): pos_start = self.pos.copy() self.advance() #

The lexer's job is to convert a sequence of characters (the source code) into a stream of tokens that represent the syntactic structure of the language. Your tokens are well-defined, covering various data types like integers, reals (floating-point numbers), strings, booleans, and characters. You've also included identifiers, keywords, operators, and special symbols such as array brackets and parentheses. Your lexer implementation has a few notable features: 1. You've defined a \`Position\` class for keeping track of where you are in the source code, which is helpful for error messages. 2. You've separated the tokens into different types, like \`TT_INT\` for integers and \`TT_REAL\` for reals. 3. You've implemented keyword recognition, which distinguishes keywords from other identifiers. 4. You've correctly handled string literals, escaping is not implemented, but you may not need it for your pseudocode language. 5. You are checking for proper array syntax with your \`make_array\` method, assuming that \`make_expr\` and \`make_identifier\` are methods that can parse expressions and identifiers within the array definitions. However, there are a few areas that you may need to work on or consider: 1. You've redeclared \`TT_LT\` twice with different values, which could cause confusion or errors in your token types. 2. In \`make_number\`, you should handle the case where a number ends with a '.', which is currently not handled correctly. 3. Your \`make_tokens\` method catches illegal characters, but there's room for improvement with detailed error messages and context handling. Some potential issues to investigate further: - The method \`make_expr\` is used in \`make_array\`, but its implementation isn't included. - The \`make_array\` method looks like it should be part of a parser rather than a lexer since it's creating an array structure and seems to require expression parsing. Lexers typically don't handle any kind of structure beyond recognizing tokens. - The \`error_det\` global variable at the beginning is not used within the provided code snippet. Overall, your approach to creating a lexer is on the right track. To continue, you'll want to write a corresponding parser that can take these tokens and produce an abstract syntax tree (AST) or some other form of intermediate representation that captures the structure of the pseudocode. Then, depending on the purpose of your pseudocode engine, you may want to implement an interpreter, compiler, or code generator that works with the AST to execute the pseudocode or convert it to an executable format."},{"prompt":"class Parser: def __init__(self,tokens): self.tokens = tokens self.hasEq = 0 for q in tokens: if q.type == TT_EQ: self.hasEq += 1 self.tok_idx = -1 self.advance() def

You'll also need to define the node classes used in the parser (\`ArrayAccessNode\`, \`ArrayDeclarationNode\`, \`ProcedureCallNode\`, \`ProcedureDeclarationNode\`, etc.). These node classes will need to store the relevant parts of the syntax, such as variable names, expression lists, and bodies of code for procedures.

Once you have properly constructed and integrated these changes into your parser, you will be able to parse array and procedure constructs within your pseudocode language.

The name suggests that these tokens are identifiers provided in the procedure declaration that will be used as argument names when the procedure is called. When parsing a procedure declaration, you would typically read the argument names as identifiers and store them as tokens in a list, which is then used in the construction of the \`ProcedureNode\`.

Here are the modifications for each class and the additions to the interpreter: For array assignment (\`ArrayAssignmentNode\`): \`\`\`python # In the Interpreter class def visit_ArrayAssignmentNode(self, node, context): res = RTResult() array_name = node.array_name_tok.value array_instance = context.symbol_table.get(array_name) index = res.register(self.visit(node.index_node, context)) if res.error: return res value = res.register(self.visit(node.value_node, context)) if res.error: return res if isinstance(array_instance, List): if index.value >= 0 and index.value < len(array_instance.elements): array_instance.elements[index.value] = value return res.success(value) else: return res.failure(RTError(index.pos_start, index.pos_end, \\"Index out of bounds: Array '\\" + array_name + \\"'\\", context)) else: return res.failure(RTError(array_instance.pos_start, array_instance.pos_end, \\"'\\" + array_name + \\"' is not an array\\", context)) \`\`\` For array access (\`ArrayAccessNode\`): \`\`\`python # In the Interpreter class def visit_ArrayAccessNode(self, node, context): res = RTResult() array_name = node.array_name_tok.value array_instance = context.symbol_table.get(array_name) index = res.register(self.visit(node.index_node, context)) if res.error: return res if isinstance(array_instance, List): try: value = array_instance.elements[index.value] return res.success(value) except: return res.failure(RTError(index.pos_start, index.pos_end, \\"Index out of bounds: Array '\\" + array_name + \\"'\\", context)) else: return res.failure(RTError(array_instance.pos_start, array_instance.pos_end, \\"'\\" + array_name + \\"' is not an array\\", context)) \`\`\` For procedure definition (\`ProcedureNode\`): \`\`\`python # In the Interpreter class def visit_ProcedureNode(self, node, context): res = RTResult() proc_name = node.procedure_name_tok.value arg_names = [arg_name.value for arg_name in node.arg_name_toks] body_node = node.body_node procedure = Procedure(proc_name, body_node, arg_names) procedure.set_context(context) procedure.set_pos(node.pos_start, node.pos_end) context.symbol_table.set(proc_name, procedure) return res.success(procedure) \`\`\` Don't forget to create a class for \`Procedure\` similar to \`Function\`. For processing procedure calls: \`\`\`python # If you have CallNode instances representing calls to procedures: def visit_CallNode(self, node, context): # Implementation for calling procedures \`\`\` You may also want to create initial values for arrays in your global symbol table, and handle the construction of arrays somewhere in your interpreter if necessary. After incorporating array handling (creation of arrays, indexing, and assignment) and procedure handling (declaration and call), your interpreter should be able to execute programs that include these features. Note that the exact implementation details depend on the design of your pseudocode language and may require further adjustments. Be sure to thoroughly test these changes with various sample programs to confirm the correct behavior. Remember to add the execution logic for arrays (creation and indexing) and procedure calls within the respective visit methods in the \`Interpreter\` class. Additionally, update the global symbol table to include any built-in functions or constants related to arrays and procedures if necessary."},{"prompt":"pls create the Procedure class for me.","completion":"To create a \`Procedure\` class that can be used within the interpreter, you can extend the \`BaseFunction\` class since a procedure is also a type of function. The class will handle executing the procedure body and managing procedure arguments similarly to how regular functions are handled in your interpreter. Here's an implementation for the \`Procedure\` class: \`\`\`python class Procedure(BaseFunction): def __init__(self, procedure_name, body_node, arg_names): super().__init__(procedure_name) self.body_node = body_node self.arg_names = arg_names def execute(self, args): res = RTResult() interpreter = Interpreter() # Create a new execution context for the procedure with a new symbol table exec_ctx = self.generateNewContext() # Populate the new context with arguments res.register(self.check_and_populate_args(self.arg_names, args, exec_ctx)) if res.error: return res # Execute the body of the procedure value = res.register(interpreter.visit(self.body_node, exec_ctx)) if res.error: return res # Normally, procedures do not return a value unless specified, return a \\"null\\" equivalent return res.success(Number(0)) def copy(self): # When copying a procedure, we copy the procedure's name, body, and argument names copy = Procedure(self.name, self.body_node, self.arg_names) copy.set_context(self.context) copy.set_pos(self.pos_start, self.pos_end) return copy def __repr__(self): return f\\"<procedure {self.name}>\\" \`\`\` In the \`Procedure\` class: - \`__init__\`: The constructor takes the procedure's name, its body node, and a list of argument names. - \`execute\`: This method is responsible for executing the procedure. It creates a new execution context, populates it with arguments, and then executes the body node. - \`copy\`: This method is used to create a copy of the procedure, which is necessary for maintaining proper scope and context during execution. - \`__repr__\`: This method provides a string representation of the procedure, useful for debugging and output purposes. To use the \`Procedure\` class in the interpreter, make sure that the \`visit_ProcedureNode\` method creates an instance of the \`Procedure\` class and that the \`visit_CallNode\` method can execute an instance of \`Procedure\` when it encounters a call to a procedure. The \`Procedure\` class above is a simple starting point, and depending on your language's features, you may need to add additional logic, such as handling return values or allowing for recursion. Make sure to align the design of the \`Procedure\` class with the conventions of your pseudocode language."},{"prompt":"so, give me the modified visit call node function as well.","completion":"To handle procedure calls in the interpreter, we need to modify the \`visit_CallNode\` function in the \`Interpreter\` class. Given your previous implementation, the modification will now need to check if the called value is either a function or a procedure, and then execute it with the provided arguments. Here is a modified \`visit_CallNode\` function that handles calls to both built-in functions, user-defined functions and procedures: \`\`\`python def visit_CallNode(self, node, context): res = RTResult() args = [] # Retrieve the function or procedure to call callable_val = res.register(self.visit(node.node_to_call, context)) if res.error: return res callable_val = callable_val.copy().set_pos(node.pos_start, node.pos_end) # Evaluate all the arguments for arg_node in node.arg_nodes: args.append(res.register(self.visit(arg_node, context))) if res.error: return res # Prepare a method to execute the function or procedure execute_method = ( callable_val.execute if isinstance(callable_val, BaseFunction) else None ) # If the callable value is neither a function nor a procedure, return an error if not execute_method: return res.failure(RTError( node.pos_start, node.pos_end, \\"Cannot call non-function/procedure\\" )) # Execute the function or procedure with the provided arguments return_value = res.register(execute_method(args)) if res.error: return res # The return value's context should be set to the current context return_value = return_value.copy().set_pos(node.pos_start, node.pos_end).set_context(context) return res.success(return_value) \`\`\` Some important things to note from this code: - After getting the \`callable_val\`, we check if it's an instance of \`BaseFunction\` (which includes user-defined functions, procedures, and built-in functions) before we attempt to execute it using the \`execute\` method. - We evaluate each argument (\`arg_nodes\`) before passing them to the \`callable_val.execute\` method. - After the function or procedure returns, we copy the return value, set its position and context, and then return it as the result of the call node. Please keep in mind that custom behavior (e.g., different handling of functions and procedures, additional types of callables) may require additional modifications to this function. Make sure to test this thoroughly with all kinds of function and procedure calls in your language to validate its behavior."}]`),z={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:R,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},D={class:"card-container"},C={key:0,class:"empty-state"},P=["disabled"],M={key:0},j={key:1};function L(i,e,l,h,r,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",D,[(a(!0),n(b,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(o,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),n("div",C,' No results found for "'+c(r.searchQuery)+'".
