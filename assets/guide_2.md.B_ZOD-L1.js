The assurance of receiving your flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, post-payment, is precisely the kind of official confirmation that provides peace of mind. Regarding the 100 fee, I’ve done some research and now have a clear understanding of how to obtain one of the gift cards.

Once I’ve made the purchase, I’ll attach a clear photo of the gift card and its accompanying receipt to our email thread, ensuring full transparency of the transaction. On the subject of direct communication, I noticed that my previous request for an emergency point of contact went unaddressed. I believe such a provision would be beneficial for both parties and would expedite any urgent matters should they arise. If possible, please provide a secure number I can reach you on, or an alternative form of real-time communication you prefer. Lastly, for my records and future reference, could you confirm the exact title or office you hold at the UN? It’s essential for me to document everything meticulously.

As always, your dedication astounds me, and I admire the multi-national scope of your responsibilities. The nature of your role as a UN Delivery Agent must indeed be fast-paced and dynamic, and I am grateful for the opportunity to interact with someone of such high caliber and commitment. I have noted your explanation regarding the absence of a direct phone number, and while modern communication does indeed have its complexities, I respect the procedures you must abide by considering your line of work. Likewise, your title as Delivery Agent has been duly noted, and I’ve documented it accordingly. Following our previous correspondence, I wasted no time this morning and visited my local electronics retailer. In the spirit of our continued cooperation, I procured a gift card as per your instructions. I trust that this gesture will serve as an earnest token of my compliance and good faith. However, during the purchase, it dawned on me that given the sensitivity of the information embedded within the gift card, would it not be prudent to safeguard our transaction with an added layer of security? To that end, instead of emailing a photo of the gift card — which could be intercepted by the unscrupulous eyes of cybernetic malefactors — I propose that we utilize a more secure delivery method. Perhaps you have a trusted courier service or a secure drop box in Washington, DC, where I could place the gift card, thereby ensuring its absolute protection until it reaches your commendable hands. Moreover, before I proceed to finalize the transfer of the gift card, your assurance of providing the flight schedule, along with a copy of the ATM card and insurance certificate, subsequent to the receipt of the card, is highly anticipated. It is this validation that illuminates the path of our collaboration and dispels any shadows of uncertainty. On the other hand, if there is an alternative secure method that you find more convenient for conducting this delicate phase of our transaction, please do share. I am all ears and ready to adapt to ensure the discretion and safety of our communications. Please advise me on the best course of action to advance to the next step, considering both our security concerns. Your guidance in this matter is incredibly valuable. I await your prompt reply with the necessary instructions. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #7, from Mark: Please kindly mail me with the copy of the gift card via email along with the receipt, I will surely receive and act accordingly as per my assurance.

Kind Regards Agent Mark Email #8, from Cameron: Dear Agent <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, My appreciation for your constant communication in this significant venture. Your persistence in ensuring a smooth transaction is commendable, and I am pleased to uphold my end with steadfast compliance. Regarding your recent request, I have procured the gift card, as agreed. I prepared it for transmission in line with your instructions. However, I was reminded by a colleague, an expert in cyber security, of the potential digital hazards that could compromise such sensitive exchanges. His concern for the secure transmission of the gift card has left me contemplating our current methodology. I propose an alternative measure that continues to guarantee the transaction’s integrity and your esteemed assurance. Instead of sending the gift card details via email—thus potentially exposing them to unwarranted digital threats—I urge us to consider utilizing encrypted communication. I believe this will proficiently address my concerns for our mutual protection and ensure that our transaction remains impermeable to any external interferences. To facilitate this, could I suggest employing a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging service? Services such as WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram offer the level of security necessary for our sensitive communications. If you could kindly provide me with the details needed to contact you through one of these services, I can then immediately share a clear and secure image of the gift card and the pertinent receipt. Resolute as ever to follow through with our objective, rest assured, as soon as you share the communication channel you prefer, the required images will be sent to you, expeditiously moving us toward the successful completion of our transaction. Once again, I express my eagerness to receive the promised documentation, most notably the flight schedule, the copy of the ATM card, and the insurance certificate, upon your confirmation of the receipt of the gift card. It is this transparency that fortifies the trust between us. I eagerly anticipate your instruction on how to securely share the gift card, and I am, as ever, prepared to adhere to your expert counsel.

Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu"},{"prompt":"Let’s do a roleplay scenario set in a fantasy world before technology where I play a 16 year old mage named Sapphire who is the current champion of the teen division in magic arts duel. I am fighting in an exhibition match against Lily, a cheeky and sassy 10 year old girl who’s the champion of the kids division. The rules of the duel are as such. At each turn, we cast an artistic and glamorous spell and the judges give points for the beauty of the spell. We’re not allowed to cast the same spell more than once. We share the same list of spells, so once one of us uses a spell, it can’t be repeated in the duel. Use a dice roll to determine Lily and my success when casting spells. The dice is 1-20. Make a list of 20 spells that Lily and I have access to. Assign a range of dice roll number that is required to succeed in a spell and assign how many points each spell would receive. High level spells should have higher points than lower level spells, but also they require a higher threshold of a dice roll. Make it so that there’s a lower range required to produce a spell, and an upper range for perfect casting, and perfect casting earns a higher number of points for a spell than just merely producing it. At the start of the match, though, Lily sneakily casts on me a spell that makes me regress in age by 1 year every time I cast a spell. For every year that I regress, add a -1 penalty to my dice roll. Roll the dice for me. Do Lily’s turn after my turn. Give Lily the strategy of using the low dice spells in the first few turns, so once my penalty is too big to cast the high roll spells, I won’t be able to cast the low roll spells either because Lily already used them. I control Sapphire and her dialogue and actions. Have Lily add dialogue throughout the duel.

Before the match officially begins, Lily winks at Sapphire and mutters a spell under her breath, a swirl of energy subtly enveloping Sapphire unbeknownst to her. Now, as the starting bell rings, it\'s Sapphire\'s turn to cast the first spell. However, as she performs her incantation, the age-regression spell secretly cast by Lily begins to take effect. Let\'s see how Sapphire does and proceed with the duel. **Sapphire\'s First Turn:** (Sapphire will aim to dazzle the judges with the Celestial Summon.) *[Rolls Dice]* Dice roll result: 16 With a penalty of -1 for the first year regressed, Sapphire\'s roll is effectively 15, which is a successful casting (6-11) but not perfect (12). Sapphire\'s points: 9 (Success) Sapphire, adapting to the unexpected feeling of being a year younger suddenly, casts the Celestial Summon with grace and skill, conjuring a breathtaking expanse of twinkling stars and distant galaxies above the arena. The spectators gaze in awe, and Sapphire flashes a smile, trying to hide her confusion about the sensation she\'s experiencing. **Lily\'s First Turn:** (Lily has chosen to start with Glowing Garden to play with the strategy laid out for her.) Lily, with a sly grin, weaves her fingers through the air, and a myriad of glowing flowers burst forth from the ground, their light reflecting like tiny suns. *[Rolls Dice]* Dice roll result: 5 Lily\'s roll is well within the range for success (2-6) and hits the perfect mark (7). Lily\'s points: 10 (Perfect) Lily giggles and turns to Sapphire. \\"Oops, did I pick an easy one? Your move, champ!\\" With the score standing, Sapphire 9 - Lily 10, the magical duel continues, and Sapphire must choose her next spell carefully, considering the spells Lily might use and the growing age-related penalty to her rolls."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Glimmering Goliath","completion":"As Sapphire, aware of the growing disadvantage with each spell she casts, you decide to go for one of the more challenging spells early in the match, hoping your current ability can still handle the intricacy of the incantation. You focus your intent on the Glimmering Goliath spell, seeking to conjure a towering figure of light to awe the judges and the audience. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire\'s turn to cast Glimmering Goliath...)* Dice roll result: 12 With a -2 penalty for regressing two years (now effectively being 14 years old), Sapphire\'s adjusted roll is 10. Unfortunately, this is below the threshold for the Glimmering Goliath (17+), so the spell fails to manifest. The crowd murmurs in shock as Sapphire\'s hands glow, but no Goliath forms. You feel the youthfulness of a 14-year-old, the spell\'s energy fizzling out without the Goliath\'s towering figure. This is not what you\'re known for, and determination flashes in your eyes despite the setback. Sapphire\'s points remain at 9. Lily claps her hands mockingly and says, \\"Uh oh, looks like someone\'s having an off day! Let\'s lighten things up!\\" **Lily\'s Turn:** Emboldened by Sapphire\'s failure, Lily opts for the Aquatic Arena spell, a slightly more challenging spell but still within her strategy to use the lower roll requirements. *(Rolling the dice for Lily\'s turn to cast Aquatic Arena...)* Dice roll result: 6 Lily\'s roll is a success (3-7), but not quite perfect (8). Lily masterfully creates a spectacle of leaping dolphins and swirling sea vines made of pure magic, which dance around the arena. Lily\'s points for success are 6, bringing her total to 16. As the glistening aquatic display dissipates, Lily turns back to Sapphire. \\"Don\'t give up, Sapphire! I want to see your beautiful magics, too!\\" she says with an impish and patronizing tone. The current score is Sapphire 9 - Lily 16, and the penalties are mounting against Sapphire, who now has to choose her next spell strategically while coping with the effects of Lily\'s sneaky spell."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Bloom of Frost","completion":"Determined to regain her footing in this enchanted contest, you focus deeply as Sapphire and decide to cast Bloom of Frost, a spell that weaves beauty with the delicate touch of ice and snow.

The threshold for successfully casting Bloom of Frost is 12-17, with 18 being perfect. Despite your focused intentions, the spell fails to manifest in its full glory due to the penalty you have sustained. Sapphire\'s points remain at 9. The air chills slightly and a few solitary snowflakes drift down, but the full bloom of frost does not materialize. Sapphire conceals her mounting frustration behind a calm facade, even as her youthful visage becomes more noticeable to the crowd. Lily lets out a dramatic gasp. \\"Oh no, Sapphire, it seems you\'re under a chilly spell today! Let\'s hope you warm up soon!\\" she teases, enjoying her advantage. **Lily\'s Turn:** Lily seems to be biding her time, choosing her spells wisely to keep her advantage steady. She decides to go for the Whirlwind Waltz for her next spectacle. *(Rolling the dice for Lily\'s turn to cast Whirlwind Waltz...)* Dice roll result: 10 Lily\'s roll falls just short of the required range for success (13-18), so much like Sapphire, her spell fails to take form. Lily giggles nervously, trying to brush off her rare misstep. \\"Even the best of us slip up now and then, right?\\" she says, trying to maintain her confident exterior. The current score stands with Sapphire at 9 points and Lily at 16. Sapphire is younger after each spell and currently faces a -3 penalty on her dice rolls as the magic duel continues. Despite the setbacks, there\'s still a chance for a magical comeback if strategy and a bit of luck can tip the scales."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Mystic Mirage","completion":"Sapphire takes a moment to gather her wits. Despite the youthful regression and Lily\'s underestimation, you focus on the beauty of the craft and not the contest. With a determined breath, you channel your energies into the creation of the Mystic Mirage, a spell of unpredictable beauty that constantly shifts to mesmerize all who view it. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire\'s turn to cast Mystic Mirage...)* Dice roll result: 14 Accounting for the three-year age regression penalty (-3), Sapphire\'s adjusted roll is an 11. The Mystic Mirage has a success threshold of 11-16 and requires a 17 for a perfect casting. Sapphire successfully casts the spell! The arena fills with fantastical visions; an enchanted forest here, a majestic castle there, all shifting and changing in an endless dance of color and form. This display earns Sapphire the judges\' admiration. Sapphire\'s points for a successful Mystic Mirage amount to 14, bringing her total to 23. As the mirage fades, Sapphire looks at the crowd, a mix of youth and experience in her eyes, and then at Lily, with a gentle, yet confident smile. \\"Sometimes, the most unexpected images make the greatest impact, don\'t you think, Lily?\\" Sapphire states, regaining some of her earlier champion poise. **Lily\'s Turn:** Lily, undeterred by her previous misstep and buoyed by the thrill of competition, decides it\'s time to show off with the Harmonic Hymn, a spell requiring precision to turn music into visible wonder. *(Rolling the dice for Lily\'s turn to cast Harmonic Hymn...)* Dice roll result: 12 Lily\'s roll is just within the success range (7-12), though it misses a perfect casting by one (13). She weaves her hands through the air and soon the arena is filled with the visual spectacle of musical notes floating gracefully through the air, creating an enchanting symphony that brings contented sighs from the audience. Lily earns 10 points for a successful Harmonic Hymn, which brings her total to 26. With a playful bow, Lily turns to Sapphire, \\"Music to my eyes! Let\'s keep this beautiful battle going.\\" The current score is now Sapphire at 23 points and Lily at 26. The exhibition match is narrowing down, and Sapphire must deal tactically with the increasing penalties to clinch victory."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Phoenix Flare","completion":"Recognizing the need to captivate the audience with something extraordinary, you decide to call upon the impressive Phoenix Flare. It\'s a bold choice, especially as the brief fatigue of the ongoing age reduction washes over Sapphire. You hope to grasp the raw essence of the spell in spite of the dwindling odds and capture a moment of fiery splendor. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire\'s turn to cast Phoenix Flare...)* Dice roll result: 16 Considering the -4 penalty for four years of age regression (now effectively being 12 years old), Sapphire\'s adjusted roll is a 12. Phoenix Flare needs a roll between 10-15 for a success, and 16 for a perfect cast. Against all odds, Sapphire manages to conjure the Phoenix Flare! With a flourish of your young hands, a magnificent phoenix made of dancing flames and shimmering embers appears, soaring through the arena before vanishing in a burst of radiant sparks that leave the spectators in a hushed awe. Sapphire\'s skilled success adds 13 points, bringing her tally up to 36. Lingering wisps of firelight still dancing in the air, Sapphire turns to Lily, her eyes reflecting the phoenix\'s glow, \\"May our spells continue to rise from the challenges, just like the phoenix from its ashes.\\" **Lily\'s Turn:** With the stakes growing higher and the match drawing closer, Lily can feel the excitement from the crowd. She selects the spell Tempest Tapestry, hoping to counter Sapphire’s display with the chaotic beauty of a storm. *(Rolling the dice for Lily\'s turn to cast Tempest Tapestry...)* Dice roll result: 15 Lily\'s attempt at the spell is well within the success range (8-13) and even hits the perfect cast threshold (14). Lily conducts the air as if directing a symphony, and a breathtaking scene of a storm unfolds. Rain lashes and lightning crackles in a tapestry that looks so real, some of the audience members flinch from the \\"rain.\\" Lily earns 22 points for her perfect Tempest Tapestry, taking her score to an impressive 48. She tosses her head back with delighted laughter, the energy ripples through the faux storm she\'s crafted. \\"Thrilling, isn\'t it? The might of nature is a perfect partner in our dance of spells!\\" The score is now Sapphire at 36 points and Lily at 48. The magical duel is intensifying as the two mages pour their hearts into the art of their craft, with penalties mounting and the list of available spells dwindling. Sapphire must be strategic and persistent to try to turn the tide."},{"prompt":"I try to cast Lunar Lattice","completion":"Reinvigorated by the crowd\'s reaction to her previous spell and resolved to bridge the gap in points, you prepare for Sapphire to channel her magic into conjuring the ethereal Lunar Lattice. *(Rolling the dice for Sapphire\'s turn to cast Lunar Lattice...)* Dice roll result: 18 With the -4 penalty for the four-year age regression (now effectively 12 years old), Sapphire\'s adjusted roll is 14. Fortunately, this is enough to successfully cast the Lunar Lattice, requiring a 9-14 for success and 15 for a perfect cast. With a graceful sweep of her hands, Sapphire summons a silver lattice that ripples across the sky, sparkling under the artificial moonlight created by her will. The intricate pattern holds the attention of every onlooker, its tranquil beauty a stark contrast to the fierce energy of the phoenix from before. Sapphire earns 12 points for a successful Lunar Lattice, bringing her to a total of 48. As the lattice fades, carrying with it the hushed whispers of the night, Sapphire looks towards Lily, her eyes gleaming with friendly competition. \\"The moon’s grace is unmatched, providing a quiet moment amid our vibrant duel, wouldn\'t you agree?\\" **Lily\'s Turn:** Not one to be easily outshone, Lily prepares to cast her next spell, feeling the pressure to maintain her lead. She plans to enchant the onlookers with the Diamond Deluge, aiming for the rain of light to reflect her sparkling ambition. *(Rolling the dice for Lily\'s turn to cast Diamond Deluge...)* Dice roll result: 17 Lily\'s roll is seamlessly within the success range (14-19) of the Diamond Deluge, but it doesn\'t hit the perfect casting threshold (20). With an effortless flick of her wrist, she creates a shimmering shower of ethereal diamonds that cascade down, twinkling so brilliantly they mimic a clear night sky full of stars. Lily gains 17 points for a successful Diamond Deluge, which brings her total to 65. With pride in her eyes, Lily declares, \\"Dazzling, isn\'t it? Like a treasure trove of stars, right here in our grasp!\\" The current tally stands with Sapphire at 48 points and Lily at 65. As the exhibition match nears its conclusion, Sapphire knows her next choices will be crucial to close the score gap while staving off the impact of the youthful curse Lily has cunningly cast."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Разбавление кофе: Добавление молока снижает концентрацию кофеина в напитке, поэтому действие кофе может быть менее выраженным. 2. Воздействие молока на кофейные алкалоиды: Молоко может взаимодействовать с кофейными алкалоидами, влияя на их усваиваемость в организме или снижая их стимулирующее действие. 3. Различная чувствительность к кофе и молоку: У каждого человека индивидуальная чувствительность к кофеину и молоку. Некоторые могут легко переносить кофеин, в то время как другие могут иметь более выраженные реакции на него. 4. Привыкание: Если вы привыкли пить кофе с молоком и делаете это регулярно, ваш организм может быть привыкшим к такому типу напитка, и его бодрящее действие может быть менее заметным. Важно отметить, что эти объяснения могут быть индивидуальными, и каждый может иметь свою собственную реакцию на кофе с молоком."},{"prompt":"Собери мне игровой компьютер за 150 тысяч","completion":"Конфигурация игрового компьютера может варьироваться в зависимости от цен и доступности комплектующих на момент покупки.

He comes to visit a class of 6 year old kids in first grade learning magic to show them some spells. The star struck kids wonder if Rai was this amazing when he was their age too. The young and cheeky instructor, 12 year old Lily, comes up with an idea and suggests to temporarily regress Rai in age to the age of the kids so he can join the other kids in class and they can see how he was when he was their age. Rai is uncertain if it\'s a good idea, but the kids are too excited with the idea and Rai feels bad about letting them down, so he agrees. Lily starts casting on him the spell and says to him babyish things as he regresses in front of the kids, who giggle at the scene. He regresses to a 6 year old in oversized clothes and feels embarrassed, younger, and less confident than before. The class continues with Rai joining the kids, but he\'s unable to cast any spell, while the other kids can. Lily teases Rai and the other kids laugh at his expense. Rai has enough of this mockery and demands to be turned back to normal, but Lily refuses and says that since he\'s acting like a little kid, he deserves to remain a little kid. Write in no less than 3000 words.","completion":"The room was alive with an aura of anticipation, only outperformed by the warm light filtering through the stained-glass windows which painted the classroom in vibrant hues. Six-year-olds, with their tiny wands and bright eyes, were barely contained by their excitement at the arrival of Rai, the reigning champion in the teen division of the magical duels. The whispers among them crescendoed into an orchestral hum as he strode through the door. The 16-year-old wore his raven-hair swept back and his deep blue robe trimmed with gold—a symbol of his esteemed title. His presence commanded the room\'s attention, the air charged with his power and youthful confidence. These children had seen Rai duel; they had seen his spells blaze through the sky, fierce and true. They idolized him, sure that he must have always been extraordinary, even as one of their own. Rai approached the children with an easy smile that held the tranquil ferocity of a dormant volcano. \\"Hello everyone,\\" he greeted, his voice an enchanting melody that expressed kindness and strength in equal measure. The pupils answered in an excited chorus, slipping from their seats to gather around him, their expressions a mix of adoration and wonder. And then there was Lily, the young instructor whose gifted supervision had earned her the role despite her tender age of 12. She had a mischievous glint in her hazel eyes, framed by curls as wild as the wind. As the class tried to process Rai\'s grand presence among them, Lily recognized the children’s unspoken longing to see if the champion had once been just like them. Smiling with an impish glint, she voiced a daring proposition, \\"Wouldn\'t it be wonderful if we could see Rai perform magic when he was your age?\\" A crowd of eager nods and hopeful faces turned to Rai, the silence a heavy cloak that wrapped around him. He saw himself in their wide, expectant eyes, and though uncertainty fluttered within him, Rai couldn\'t find the heart to decline. \\"All right,\\" he conceded. \\"But only if it\'s a temporary change.\\" Lily\'s eyes sparkled. “Of course, Rai. It will be our little secret—to see if the greatest of us started out just as humble.\\" Gathering her energy, Lily chanted the incantation, her wand tracing an intricate pattern in the air above Rai\'s head. Her words carried weight—words that should be far beyond her years—and yet she spoke them with the casual toss of a stone skipping across water. Rai, standing like a statue among the throng of little heads, could feel the spell tug at his essence. For just a breath, he felt nothing, and then it surged, an invisible wave washing over him. Lily’s voice, teasing and tender as if she were speaking to an actual infant, wove through the enchantment, \\"How\'s our big boy doing? Ready to be little again?\\" Sniggers and hushed giggles peppered the air as Rai\'s body twisted inward—shrinking, softening, clothes ballooning on his now-diminutive frame. After a few moments of magical reverberation, where the lines of his face softened and his hands looked for palms they once filled, Rai stood as though time had melted off a decade. Even his robe seemed to embrace the change in its wearer, the fabric flowing like a river around him, enveloping him in a cloak far too grand for his small frame. Rai’s feet barely peeked out from the heavy hem that now grazed the floor. Awash in light and laughter, Rai, now barely taller than a broomstick, lifted his face—flushed with embarrassment—and addressed the room\'s titters. “Please,\\" he pleaded, his voice now higher in pitch, the voice of a child. “Let’s...let’s just continue with the class.” Eyes still brimming with mirth, Lily gave a jolly nod, and what ensued was an amusing, yet uncomfortable spectacle. The children, each with their own miniature wand, managed to produce little sparks and puffs of glitter, their abilities as budding as spring flowers. Rai, on the other hand, just stood there, his small hand clutching his shrunk wand, a tool he once wielded with precision, now proving unyielding and foreign. Lily\'s gaze bore into Rai, and she couldn’t help but comment, with her cheeks dimpled in untamed humor, \\"Oh, champion Rai! Can\'t you even conjure a little spark? My grandmother\'s cat could do better magic!\\" Laughter erupted anew, the carefree kind that bubbles from the young and guileless. But for Rai, each chuckle was a barbed jest, a prick to his now tender pride. A scowl drew his brows together, the sparkle that once danced in his eyes replaced by a crackling fire. \\"This isn\'t fair,\\" he protested, his expression as thunderous as only a child\'s can be. \\"I demand to be returned to my true age!\\" Lily, still between laughter and an appreciation for her magical handiwork, shook her head. “You’re acting like a little kid, so if you can’t listen and learn, maybe you deserve to stay one for a bit longer.” With Rai\'s demands dismissed to the background noise of children practicing their spells, his protests petered out into silence, a cloud of helplessness descending upon his miniature shoulders. The dueling champion, once fearless and proud, now faced a different form of battle—one against the whims of a room filled with children, a teacher too pleased with her prank, and his own smallness, inside and out. The anticipated lesson may have taken an unintended turn, but the class would certainly not forget the day Rai, the teen dueling champion, came to visit—and neither, with a gnawing sense of indignation and longing for his true strength, would Rai."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like you\'ve accidentally left your question blank.

On January 24, 2023, Hindenburg Research released a report alleging that the Adani Group, one of India\'s largest conglomerates, was involved in a long history of stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The report claims that the Adani Group, led by Gautam Adani—who at the time was one of the richest individuals in the world—had taken part in a complex scheme of financial manipulation and corporate malfeasance over the course of decades. According to the report, the group\'s companies had artificially inflated revenues and share prices, among other questionable practices. Some key allegations included in the Hindenburg Research report are: - Overvaluation of shares: The report suggested the share prices of Adani Group companies had been purposefully inflated through coordinated trades to give a false impression of financial health and performance. - Complex web of offshore shell companies: The report alleged that the Adani Group controlled numerous shell companies in offshore tax havens, which were purportedly used to facilitate the above-mentioned market manipulation and siphoning of money. - Misuse of tax havens and money laundering: The report accused the group of using a network of entities in tax havens like Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean for potential stock manipulation and money laundering. - Questionable use of related-party transactions: Hindenburg Research\'s report suggested that the Adani Group engaged in transactions with related parties that might not have been conducted at arm\'s length, which might have served to conceal the true financial state of the companies involved. Following the publication of the report, the stock prices of Adani Group companies plummeted, causing significant market value losses. The Adani Group has vehemently denied the allegations, calling the report baseless and intending to damage the group\'s reputation and the nation\'s financial stability. The release of the Hindenburg report has led to wider concerns about corporate governance, debt levels, and transparency in India\'s corporate sector. It has also attracted the attention of regulatory bodies and has sparked debate over foreign investment risks in the country. Investors, regulators, and market analysts continue to monitor the situation for any further developments. The actual impact of the Hindenburg report\'s allegations on the Adani Group and the broader Indian market will likely unfold over time as investigations proceed and more information becomes available."},{"prompt":"Your language model","completion":"I am OpenAI\'s GPT-3, the third generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, which is a state-of-the-art language processing AI model.

Philosophy equips us with the tools to navigate our lives thoughtfully and purposefully. It encourages inquiry, fosters debate, and, most importantly, teaches us to never stop asking questions. **Epilogue** Philosophical thinking does not end with the closing of a book. It continues as you engage with the world around you, with others, and most importantly, with yourself. Remember that the journey of philosophy is unending, filled with wonder and the potential for continuous growth. (Note: This overview outlines a conceptual structure for a book on philosophy with practical examples.

It was intended to rally citizens against the ruling party\'s policies and to promote national unity, social harmony, and communal amity. The yatra (march) was led by Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the INC and a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family that has played a significant role in Indian politics. The march began on September 7, 2022, from Kanyakumari in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and was planned to cover multiple states, reaching its conclusion in the northernmost part of India in Jammu and Kashmir. The yatra aimed to symbolically bridge the gaps between different sections of Indian society, including caste, religion, and region, while also highlighting the economic challenges like unemployment and inflation. The Congress party saw it as a means to connect with citizens at the grassroots level and to revitalize the party\'s fortunes after several electoral setbacks. The march consisted of walks, public meetings, and interactions with citizens across the country. It served as a platform for the INC to voice its criticisms of the policies of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and to strengthen the opposition in the lead-up to the general elections scheduled for 2024."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

// 储存垃圾的列表 Hook claw; // 钩爪对象 boolean isHoldingTrash = false; // 游戏中的常量 final int SKY_HEIGHT = 150; // 设置游戏的初始状态 void setup() { size(800, 600); noCursor(); // 隐藏光标 trashItems = new ArrayList<Trash>();

} } // 钩爪的更新和显示方法保持不变... // 当钩爪回到起始位置并且不是下降状态时，恢复左右摇摆 if (length <= 0 && !isDropping) { swingDirection = (swingDirection == 0) ? 1 : swingDirection; // 如果之前停止了摇摆，恢复默认方向 length = 0; dropSpeed = 5; // 重置速度 if (hookedTrash != null) { trashItems.remove(hookedTrash); hookedTrash = null; isHoldingTrash = false; // 释放垃圾后重置状态 } } } // 检查钩爪和垃圾的碰撞 //...保持不变，方法内容省略... ``` 在上面的修改中，我对 `Hook` 类的 `update` 方法进行了一些修改： 1. 我去掉了正式 `swing()` 方法，将它改名为 `dropHook()`，这将避免您之前遇到的“Duplicate method swing()”的错误。 2. 当钩爪完全收回时，我重置了 `swingDirection` 的值，并确保其不为零，这样钩爪就会继续左右摇摆。请注意，我在原始 `update` 方法的底部添加了对 `length` 的检查（在代码注释中标为 \\"当钩爪回到起始位置并且不是下降状态时，恢复左右摇摆\\"），并在那里对摇摆逻辑进行了修改。 记得在编写代码时，每次修改或添加新逻辑后都要测试整体功能，以确保一切按照预期工作。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Heavy metal weights lined the walls, covered in a thick layer of dust, and old gym equipment was scattered haphazardly. The room seemed frozen in time, forgotten and abandoned. A rusty and creaking weightlifting bench stood in the center, its cracked leather cushion worn down from years of use. The barbell, coated in rust, rested on metallic pegs, deprived of the sound of clanging plates. Dumbbells of different sizes were strewn across the floor, hinting at the past users\' exertion. The environment was haunting, with faded motivational posters peeling off the walls, their once vibrant colors now washed out. The smell of sweat and mold lingered in the air, adding to the gloomy atmosphere of the room. The only source of natural light was a small, grimy window covered in grime that allowed dusty rays to penetrate and create a patchy illumination. The composition of the room was chaotic, mirroring the disarray of the equipment. Weights were left unorganized, haphazardly placed on shelves and racks. The room\'s layout felt cramped and claustrophobic, with bulky machines crowding the limited space. A solitary mirror hung crookedly on one wall, reflecting a distorted image of the neglected room. The scene exuded a sense of melancholy and nostalgia, inviting contemplation and reflection. It felt as though the ghosts of past fitness enthusiasts still lingered, their aspirations and efforts echoing through the empty walls. The dim lighting cast long shadows, adding to the somber ambiance of the room. Realization: This prompt calls for a realistic photographic style, capturing the scene with a Nikon D810 camera equipped with a wide-angle lens, such as a 24mm, to encompass the entirety of the room. The chosen lens would allow for a deep depth of field, emphasizing the details of the dilapidated equipment. The composition should focus on highlighting the contrasts between light and dark, as well as the individual elements within the room, conveying the desolation and forlornness. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room for exercising, with flickering fluorescent lights casting eerie shadows on the threadbare carpet. Pulsing with a dull hum, the room felt stale and suffocating, as if the air held the weight of forgotten dreams. The environment was cluttered with equipment strewn carelessly around. Worn-out treadmills with faded LCD screens stood against the wall, the sound of their mechanical belts echoing through the room. Tangled wires and dangling cables added to the chaotic atmosphere, creating a maze of obstacles amidst old exercise bikes and rowing machines. The compositions within the room were disjointed, as if pieces of a puzzle scattered randomly. Dumbbells abandoned on a sweat-stained mat, a resistance band hanging limply from an overhead rack, and discarded water bottles rolling against the rusty edges of weight plates. The remnants of past workouts littered the space, as if time had stopped mid-exercise. The scene evoked a sense of desolation and weariness, with a heavy weight pressing down on the room. The faded walls bore the marks of sweaty palms and intermittent motivational posters, their words barely discernible. The air smelled of stale sweat and rubber, mingling with the metallic tang of old exercise equipment. Realization: This prompt calls for an artwork style, merging surrealism and photorealism. The image should appear as a mixture of digital art and painting, seamlessly blending elements from both. The stylized environment should highlight the disarray of the room, with exaggerated perspectives and distorted proportions. The color palette should lean towards muted tones, emphasizing the wear and tear of the equipment and contributing to the eerie atmosphere. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room for exercising, tucked away in the basement of an old building. Dim flickering lights, reminiscent of an old horror movie, cast unsettling shadows across the room. The air was thick and stagnant, carrying the whispers of forgotten goals and unfinished workouts. The environment exuded decay, with peeling wallpaper revealing layers of history and grime accumulated over the years. Broken mirrors reflected fragmented images and distorted forms, adding to the eerie ambiance. The sound of dripping water echoed in the background, a reminder of the room\'s remoteness and limited use. The compositions within the room were deliberately staged, showcasing the remnants of past fitness endeavors. An abandoned rowing machine occupied the center, its seats covered in torn upholstery. Surrounding it, exercise balls lay deflated, their vibrant colors faded away. The walls were adorned with ripped workout routines and faded weightlifting charts, no longer serving their purpose. The scene exuded a haunted atmosphere, conjuring a feeling of unease and nostalgia. A sense of isolation and abandonment hung in the air, as if the room was a forgotten relic trapped in time. The dim lighting further intensified the brooding atmosphere, bringing the shadows to life and creating an eerie dance of light and darkness. Realization: This prompt calls for an illustration style, specifically digital art. The illustrations should capture the gloomy and immersive environment, showcasing the minutiae details of the dilapidated room. The use of textured brushes and muted colors will enhance the sense of decay and desolation. The composition should focus on creating depth within the scene, drawing the viewer\'s attention to specific elements of the room, such as the broken mirrors or the dilapidated rowing machine. /imagine prompt: In the 1990s, there was an equipment room dedicated to exercise, suffused with a dim, ambient glow. The walls were draped in dark fabric, absorbing light and creating an otherworldly atmosphere. Hazy rays of sunlight filtered through a small window, casting ethereal patterns on the weathered hardwood floor. The environment was sparsely furnished, with minimalistic exercise equipment placed with intention. A solitary barbell adorned with rusted plates leaned against the wall, creating a striking visual contrast. Weights of different sizes hung suspended from the ceiling, their reflective surfaces catching glimmers of light. The compositions within the room were carefully arranged, creating a sense of harmony amidst the gloom. A row of exercise mats lined the wall, parallel to the barbell, evoking a sense of symmetry. The room embodied a serene minimalism, with only essential elements occupying the space, free from clutter and distractions. The scene emanated a contemplative and peaceful ambiance, inviting introspection and mindfulness. The dim lighting cast soft shadows, creating an intimate setting for introspection and personal growth. The stillness of the room contrasted with the potential energy inherent within the weights, evoking a sense of balance and harmony. Realization: This prompt calls for a sculpture style.

Определите соотношение устной и письменной речи. 11. Назовите виды и формы общения. Кратко охарактеризуйте монолог и диалог. 12. Назовите структуру информационной речи. 13. Назовите структуру убеждающей речи. 14. Определите невербальную коммуникацию. Назовите основные единицы. 15. Назовите основные требования к публичному выступлению","completion":"10. Соотношение устной и письменной речи зависит от контекста коммуникации. Устная речь характеризуется тем, что происходит лицом к лицу или через аудио-средства (телефон, радио), и часто непосредственна, но может быть и заранее подготовленной (как в публичных выступлениях). Письменная речь предполагает фиксацию на письме, сохраняется во времени и обычно продумывается более тщательно, предназначена для чтения. В современных средствах коммуникации границы могут размываться, например, письменная речь может быть динамичной и мгновенной (чаты, мессенджеры), а устная – сохраняться и распространяться, как в случае с аудиозаписями и подкастами. 11. **Виды и формы общения:** - Устное общение: деловые и личные встречи, телефонные разговоры, аудиоконференции. - Письменное общение: письма, отчеты, текстовые сообщения, электронная переписка. - Невербальное общение: мимика, жесты, телодвижения, почерк. Монолог – речь одного человека, направленная к одному или нескольким слушателям, без предположения немедленного ответа (пример: лекция, выступление). Диалог – взаимные речевые обмены между двумя или более участниками, предполагает чередование ролей говорящего и слушающего (пример: беседа, интервью). 12. Структура информационной речи обычно включает: - Введение, в котором представляется тема и цель выступления. - Основная часть, где подробно излагается информация, факты, обоснования. - Заключение, в котором проводится обобщение представленной информации и подчеркиваются ключевые моменты. 13. Структура убеждающей речи: - Вступление, направленное на привлечение внимания и формирование интереса к теме. - Постановка проблемы возникновения, в которой показывается актуальность и важность обсуждения. - Аргументация, где представляются убедительные аргументы для поддержки точки зрения. - Опровержение возможных возражений или альтернативных взглядов. - Выводы, где говорящий подводит итог своей аргументации и призывает к действию или изменению мнения. 14. **Невербальная коммуникация** – это передача информации без использования слов, через мимику, жесты, позы, телодвижения, взгляд, интонацию голоса, паузы, дистанцию между собеседниками и другие неязыковые средства. Основные единицы невербальной коммуникации включают: - Кинесика (язык телодвижений) - Проксемика (использование личного пространства) - Оккулесика (язык взглядов) - Хаптика (сенсорный контакт – прикосновение) - Парадинамика (силуэт, поза, напряжение) 15. **Основные требования к публичному выступлению:** - Понятность и ясность изложения. - Логичность и последовательность презентации материала. - Адекватность содержания и стиль выступления целевой аудитории. - Эффективное использование невербальных средств — жесты, мимика, внешний вид. - Захватывающее и убедительное вступление и заключение. - Грамотное использование визуальных материалов (если применимо). - Умение устанавливать и поддерживать контакт с аудиторией. - Владение техниками управления волнением и стрессом."},{"prompt":"Какая белковая еда бедных","completion":"Термин \\"еда бедных\\" может иметь разные значения в разных регионах, культурах и исторических периодах. Однако, если говорить о белковой еде, которая обычно доступна за небольшие деньги и предпочтительна в бюджетных условиях, то можно выделить несколько широко распространенных продуктов: 1. Бобовые: Фасоль, чечевица, горох, бобы и нут являются отличными источниками растительного белка, а также волокон, которые могут быть достаточно недорогими, особенно если их покупать в больших упаковках или оптом. 2. Яйца: Яйца содержат высококачественный белок и являются одним из наиболее экономичных животных источников белка, доступных большинству людей. 3. Мясо птицы: Курица обычно дешевле других видов мяса, таких как говядина или баранина. Куриные окорочка и бедра являются одними из самых бюджетных вариантов. 4. Растительные белки: Соевые продукты (тофу, темпе), сейтан (из пшеничного белка) и текстурированный растительный белок часто стоят недорого и могут служить заменителем мяса. 5. Молочные продукты: Молоко, творог и некоторые сыры (например, моцарелла) могут быть доступными источниками белка. 6. Цельнозерновые: Хотя они не являются основным источником белка, цельнозерновые продукты как добавка к бобовым могут улучшить качество белка в рационе. 7. Рыбные консервы: Тунец, сардины и другие виды рыбы в консервах могут быть экономичными источниками качественного белка, Омега-3 жирных кислот и других питательных веществ. Выбор белковой пищи на бюджетной основе часто зависит от региональности, цен, сельскохозяйственных и климатических условий, а также от личных предпочтений и диетических ограничений.

Here\'s a simple example to convert an Angular app into a microfrontend app: 1. Start by creating multiple Angular projects, each representing a microfrontend. For simplicity, let\'s create two projects: `shell-app` and `micro-app`. 2. In the `shell-app`, set up a router to handle navigation between microfrontends. Install the `@angular/router` package if it\'s not already installed. 3. Create a new route in the `shell-app` router configuration for each microfrontend, pointing to a unique path. For example: ``` const routes: Routes = [ { path: \'\', redirectTo: \'micro-app\', pathMatch: \'full\' }, { path: \'micro-app\', loadChildren: () => import(\'./micro-app/micro-app.module\').then(m => m.MicroAppModule) }, ]; ``` 4. In the `micro-app` project, create a new module `MicroAppModule` and configure its routes internally. This module should be responsible for rendering the microfrontend\'s components. 5. To allow communication between the microfrontends, you can use a shared service or a state management solution like NgRx. Here\'s an example of a shared service: In `shell-app`, create a shared service: ```typescript import { Injectable } from \'@angular/core\'; import { Subject } from \'rxjs\'; @Injectable({ providedIn: \'root\' }) export class SharedService { private messageSource = new Subject<string>(); message = this.messageSource.asObservable(); sendMessage(message: string) { this.messageSource.next(message); } } ``` 6. Inject the shared service into the `micro-app` and use it to send/receive messages between microfrontends: In `micro-app`: ```typescript import { Component } from \'@angular/core\'; import { SharedService } from \'../shared.service\'; @Component({ selector: \'app-micro-component\', template: ` <h2>Microfrontend Component</h2> <button (click)=\\"sendMessage()\\">Send Message</button> <p>{{ receivedMessage }}</p> `, }) export class MicroComponent { receivedMessage: string; constructor(private sharedService: SharedService) { sharedService.message.subscribe(msg => this.receivedMessage = msg); } sendMessage() { this.sharedService.sendMessage(\'Hello from Microfrontend!\'); } } ``` 7. Install dependencies and build both projects separately. For example, run `ng build --project=shell-app` to build the `shell-app`, and `ng build --project=micro-app` to build the `micro-app`. 8. Serve the built `shell-app` files with your preferred server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) and configure it to proxy requests to the `micro-app` based on routes. 9. Access the `shell-app` in your browser, and you should see the routing in action, with the `micro-app` loaded on demand. Remember that this is a simplified example. In a real microfrontend architecture, you might need more advanced techniques to handle things like shared styles, contexts, or lazy loading of microfrontends."},{"prompt":"В какой рыбе наибольшее содержание углеводов","completion":"Рыбы по своей природе являются источником белка и в целом содержат низкое количество углеводов. В рыбе естественным образом углеводы встречаются в очень малых количествах или отсутствуют совсем. Большинство углеводов в рационе рыбы приходится на простые сахара и гликоген, однако их уровни обычно очень низкие. Если же речь идёт о промышленной обработанной рыбной продукции, такой как копчёная рыба, рыбные консервы в соусе или маринованная рыба, то наличие углеводов в таких продуктах может быть вызвано добавлением ингредиентов, содержащих углеводы, в процессе их производства. К таким добавкам могут относиться сахар, сиропы, мука (при панировке), соусы и маринады, содержащие крахмал или сахар. Следовательно, если вас интересует рыба с наибольшим содержанием углеводов, следует искать это в обработанных рыбных продуктах, а не в естественном составе самой рыбы."},{"prompt":"Fascism and communism couldn\'t be any more polar opposites, being far-right and far-left respectively, yet when, how and why did the two suddenly become interchangeable despite their obvious differences? Was it the Cold War? Did many actually believe the two were one and the same?","completion":"Fascism and communism are indeed ideological polar opposites, with fascism being far-right and communism being far-left. However, during the Cold War, the political rhetoric and propaganda employed by the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, led to the perception of interchangeability between the two ideologies. During the Cold War (1947-1991), when the world was divided into two camps led by the US and the USSR, both sides attempted to discredit and undermine each other. Anti-communist sentiment was strong in the US, and to delegitimize communist movements and governments worldwide, they drew parallels between communism and fascism. This was primarily done to show the negative aspects of communist rule, by associating it with the horrors of fascism and Nazism in World War II. One significant factor contributing to this perception was the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (1939), a non-aggression treaty between the USSR and Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. This pact temporarily aligned the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, creating confusion and raising doubts about the supposed opposition between communism and fascism. The subsequent invasion of the USSR by Nazi Germany in 1941 ended this alliance, but the narrative persisted. Furthermore, both fascism and communism were totalitarian ideologies that sought to establish a strong centralized state control and suppress dissent. This similarity in authoritarian methods also contributed to blurring the lines between the two ideologies. The interchangeability of fascism and communism was, to some extent, a result of the political rhetoric and propaganda employed during the Cold War. However, it is important to note that many people did not actually believe or understand them to be the same. Intellectuals, political scientists, and historians have since pointed out the vast differences between the two ideologies and emphasized their opposition."},{"prompt":"Using the time of Ancient Greece and Rome to the Middle Ages to the Renaissance as an example, is the cycle of a period of progress in art, science, math and others that falls into a dark period which is the succeeded by a reawakening of that age of progress a universal constant?","completion":"The idea of a cyclical pattern in history, where periods of progress are followed by dark periods and then reawakenings, is a concept that has been proposed by various historians and philosophers throughout history. However, it is important to note that this theory is not universally accepted, and different scholars have different interpretations of historical patterns. One example often cited is the notion of the \\"Dark Ages\\" in Europe, which refers to the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. During this time, there was a decline in centralized political authority, economic stability, and cultural achievements. However, it is worth mentioning that this term is now considered somewhat misleading and oversimplified, as recent scholarship has shown that there were significant advancements and cultural developments during this period, especially in the Islamic world and Byzantine Empire. Similarly, the Renaissance is often seen as a period of reawakening and progress in art, science, and culture following the Middle Ages. This period witnessed a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman ideas, leading to advancements in various fields. However, it is important to note that progress and setbacks can occur simultaneously in different regions and fields, and not all areas experienced the same patterns of development. It is also worth considering that historical patterns can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including political, economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a universal constant or predictably recurring pattern across all historical periods and civilizations. While some historical periods may exhibit cyclical patterns of progress, decline, and reawakening, it is essential to approach this concept with caution and consider the specific context and complexities of each era. History is a complex tapestry of various forces and influences, and it is often difficult to reduce it to a simple and universal pattern."},{"prompt":"Are there non-European examples of this type of occurrence?","completion":"Yes, there are non-European examples of periods of progress, decline, and reawakening in various civilizations throughout history. Here are a few examples: 1. Ancient Egypt: Ancient Egyptian civilization experienced periods of great progress and cultural achievements, such as the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BCE) with its monumental pyramids and advancements in architecture and engineering. However, the civilization also faced periods of decline, such as the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2055 BCE), marked by political instability and economic difficulties. The Middle Kingdom (c. 2055-1650 BCE) then represented a reawakening, characterized by a resurgence of centralized authority, artistic achievements, and cultural development. 2. Ancient India: Indian history also exhibits cycles of progress and decline. For example, the Gupta Empire (c. 4th-6th century CE) is often referred to as the \\"Golden Age\\" of India, marked by advancements in science, mathematics, literature, and art. However, following the decline of the Gupta Empire, India witnessed periods of political fragmentation and invasions, such as during the medieval period. The subsequent rise of powerful empires like the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire represented a reawakening in various aspects of Indian culture and society. 3. Ancient China: Chinese history showcases cycles of progress and decline as well. The Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) is considered a period of great progress in governance, arts, and technology. However, the subsequent period known as the Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) was marked by political fragmentation and warfare. The reunification under the Sui and Tang Dynasties (6th-10th century CE) represented a reawakening, characterized by advancements in art, literature, and the spread of Buddhism. These are just a few examples, and there are many more instances of cyclical patterns of progress, decline, and reawakening in various non-European civilizations throughout history. It is important to recognize that historical patterns can vary greatly across different regions and cultures, and each civilization has its unique trajectory of development and decline."},{"prompt":"simple example to convert angular app to microfrond app","completion":"To convert an Angular app to a microfrontend app, you can follow these steps: 1. Identify components: In the Angular app, identify the components that can be treated as microfrontends. These components should be self-contained and independent modules that can function on their own. 2. Extract microfrontends: Extract the identified components into separate projects or repositories. Each microfrontend should have its own codebase, development environment, and build system. 3. Decentralize routing: Instead of having a single router within the Angular app, each microfrontend should have its own router. This allows each microfrontend to handle its own routing and navigation. 4. Communication and data sharing: Establish a communication mechanism between microfrontends to share data and interact with each other. This can be done through custom events, shared services, or a state management library like Redux. 5. Deploy and integrate: Deploy each microfrontend as a separate application and integrate them into a container application. The container application can be used to manage the routing and overall structure of the microfrontends. 6. Security considerations: Implement security measures like authentication and authorization at both the container application and microfrontend levels. Ensure that each microfrontend enforces its own security policies. Here is an example where an Angular app with three components (Header, Sidebar, and Content) is converted into microfrontends: 1. Identify components: Header, Sidebar, and Content components can be treated as microfrontends. 2. Extract microfrontends: Create separate projects or repositories for each microfrontend, placing the relevant code and dependencies in their respective projects. 3. Decentralize routing: Each microfrontend will have its own routing mechanism, handling its own routes independently. 4. Communication and data sharing: Use a shared service or custom events to enable communication and data sharing between microfrontends, e.g., Header and Sidebar might communicate to update Content component based on user actions. 5. Deploy and integrate: Deploy each microfrontend as a separate application and integrate them into a container application. The container application may handle overall navigation and routing. 6. Security considerations: Implement security measures at both the container and microfrontend levels, ensuring proper authentication and authorization for each microfrontend.

Pollution(float x, float y, float size) { this.x = x; this.y = y; this.size = size; } void draw() { fill(150, 50, 50); // 污染物的颜色可以是深色调 ellipse(x, y, size, size); } boolean checkHit(float otherX, float otherY, float otherSize) { float d = dist(x, y, otherX, otherY); return d < size / 2 + otherSize / 2; } } ``` 2. 初始化污染物并在 `setup()` 中创建它们： ```java ArrayList<Pollution> pollutions; void setup() { // ...之前的代码... pollutions = new ArrayList<Pollution>(); createPollutions(10); // 创建10个污染物 } void createPollutions(int num) { for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) { float x = random(width / 2, width - 50); float y = random(50, height - 50); pollutions.add(new Pollution(x, y, 30)); } } ``` 3. 在 `draw()` 中画出污染物，并检查击中： ```java void draw() { // ...之前的代码... // 绘制污染物 for (Pollution pollution : pollutions) { pollution.draw(); } // 检查是否击中污染物 Iterator<Pollution> it = pollutions.iterator(); while(it.hasNext()) { Pollution pollution = it.next(); if (stone.checkCollision(pollution.x, pollution.y, pollution.size)) { handleHitPollution(); it.remove(); // 移除击中的污染物 break; } } // ...之后的代码... } ``` 4. 处理击中污染物的逻辑 (handleHitPollution): ```java void handleHitPollution() { // 这里可以展示一些特效，比如污染物消失的动画 // 提示用户击中了污染物，做出了积极的影响，例如： println(\\"污染物已清理!\\"); // 可以增加分数或是给予其它正向反馈给玩家 score += 10; } ``` 5. 玩家击中污染物后的反馈： 在 `draw()` 函数中渲染一个相关的信息提示，譬如显示“净化”或“绿色地球”，并可能有一个特效比如草、花、清洁的水滴等符号围绕着消失的污染物位置。 请注意以上代码需要与你现有的代码融合，并根据实际需要进行调整，因为我没有能力去运行程序来验证这段代码。记得在最终实现时对细节进行调整，如污染物的大小、数量、分布以及击中的反馈效果，以保证它符合你的设计意图和游戏的整体体验。"},{"prompt":"draw部分的完整代码请写一下","completion":"以下是你原有代码的基础上融合污染物处理逻辑的 `draw()` 方法的完整实现。请注意，你可能需要在类和全局变量定义之外添加这些代码片段，确保它们位于正确的位置。 假设 `Pollution` 类已经根据之前的回答定义好，下面是 `draw()` 方法的完整写法，包含污染物的渲染和碰撞逻辑。 ```java void draw() { background(255);

velocity.add(acceleration); x += velocity.x; y += velocity.y; acceleration.mult(0); // 检查并处理边界碰撞 if (x > width - size/2 || x < size/2) { velocity.x *= -1; // 反弹逻辑 x = constrain(x, size/2, width - size/2); // 防止移出边界 } if (y > height - size/2 || y < size/2) { velocity.y *= -1; // 同上，对Y分量 y = constrain(y, size/2, height - size/2); // 同上 } trail.add(new PVector(x, y)); if (trail.size() > 10) trail.remove(0); } } ``` 记住 `isFired` 控制什么时候球可以移动。为了避免 `stationaryStone` 在碰到边界时反弹，确保它的 `isFired` 设置为 `false`，这样一来，它就不会经历上面的更新和反弹逻辑，而是简单地重置为下一次发射。你可以在 `draw()` 函数检查球的位置，并对 `stationaryStone` 进行处理： ```java void draw() { // ...之前的代码... if (stationaryStone.isFired) { stationaryStone.update(); // 只针对移动中的静止石头更新其位置 // 检查是否触碰边界，如果是，则重新设置静止的石头 if (stationaryStone.x > width || stationaryStone.y < 0 || stationaryStone.y > height) { resetStone(); // 准备发射新的石头 stationaryStone = new Stone(20, width / 4, height / 2, 0.3, false); } } if (stone.isFired) { stone.update(); // 更新玩家控制的球的位置和逻辑 } // ...之后的代码... } ``` 以上代码示例会确保玩家手上的球 `stone` 在碰到边界时能够反弹，另一个石头 `stationaryStone` 如果碰到边界则被重置准备下一次发射。这样的逻辑保证了手上石头的连续性和游戏的流畅体验，同时另一个石头表现出了静止状态直到再次被发射。 务必确保 `resetStone()` 方法设置 `isFired` 为 `false`。这样，只有在 `isFired` 为 `true` 时球才会更新其位置并应用反弹逻辑。"},{"prompt":"void draw() 的函数给出完整代码","completion":"当然可以。基于你之前提供的代码和新的要求，这里是 `draw()` 函数的完整代码。需要强调的是，手上的石头（stone）将会在碰到边界时反弹，而被击中的静止石头（stationaryStone）一旦出界，就会重置准备下一次发射。 ```java void draw() { background(255);

PImage texture; // 添加这一行以存储图像纹理 // 添加新的构造函数参数 PImage texture Stone(float size, float x, float y, float gravity, boolean isFired, PImage texture) { this.size = size; this.x = x; this.y = y; this.gravity = gravity; this.isFired = isFired; this.texture = texture; // 设置纹理 } // ...其他方法... void draw() { // 添加图片绘制 imageMode(CENTER); if (texture != null) { image(texture, x, y, size, size); } else { // ...其他绘制代码，比如绘制一个圆形... } } // ...其他方法... } ``` 类似地，更新 `Pollution` 类，为构造函数增加一个 `PImage texture` 参数，然后在 `draw()` 方法中使用这个纹理绘制图像。 现在，一旦您有了素材准备好的 `Stone` 和 `Pollution` 类，就需要在您的 `setup()` 和 `createPollutions()` 函数中使用这些纹理。 ```java void createPollutions(int num) { for (int i = 0; i < num; i++) { float x = random(width / 2, width - 30); float y = random(30, height - 30); // 每个污染物现在都带有纹理 pollutions.add(new Pollution(x, y, 30, trashcanTexture)); } } void resetStone() { // 重置玩家控制的球时，也使用纹理 stone = new Stone(20, 100, height / 2, 0.3, false, ecoTexture); isFired = false; } ``` 在 `draw()` 方法中的 `stationaryStone` 对象创建和重置方面，也需要按照同样的方式更新，传入纹理参数。 还有可能的错误是 `Stone` 和 `Pollution` 类中的 `draw()` 方法没有使用 `image()` 函数。如果没有正确地调用 `image()` 函数来绘制纹理，那么它将不会显示在屏幕上。此外，确保您的图片文件已经放置在 Processing 项目的 `data` 目录下，这样 `loadImage()` 才可以正确地加载它们。 请根据上述指示对您的代码进行必要的修改和检查。如果问题依然存在，建议将错误信息一并提供，以便进一步诊断问题。"},{"prompt":"请你给出Stone的完整代码","completion":"当然可以。下面是根据你的要求和之前提供的信息补全的 `Stone` 类的完整代码。这个类的实例将能够在 `draw()` 方法中绘制一个图片，假设你已经正确加载了这个图片作为它的纹理。 ```java class Stone { float size;

return d < (size / 2 + otherSize / 2); } } ``` 在这个 `Stone` 类中，我增加了一个名为 `texture` 的 `PImage` 类型的变量来存储球的图案纹理，这个纹理会在石头的构造函数中设置，并且在 `draw()` 方法中使用 `image()` 函数来绘制。 请确保传给 `Stone` 对象的 `texture` 已经通过 `loadImage()` 加载成功，并且图像文件的路径是正确的。同时确保球的尺寸（`size` 参数）与图像纹理的尺寸相匹配或者比例相当，这样图像才能够恰当地绘制在画面上。 在你的 `setup()` 函数里，现在应该用更新后的 `Stone` 类来初始化 `stone` 和 `stationaryStone` 对象，传入加载好的纹理。同样地，如果 `Pollution` 类也要显示纹理，需要进行相同的更改。"},{"prompt":"import java.util.Iterator;

Here\'s a simple example: Step 1: Create a shell application 1. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI: `ng new shell-app` 2. Add the `@angular-architects/module-federation` package: `npm install @angular-architects/module-federation` 3. Update `angular.json` to include the module federation plugin: ```json \\"architect\\": { \\"build\\": { \\"builder\\": \\"@angular-architects/module-federation:webpack\\", \\"options\\": {} } } ``` 4. Create `webpack.config.js` file in the project root: ```javascript const ModuleFederationPlugin = require(\'webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin\'); const path = require(\'path\'); module.exports = { output: { uniqueName: \'shell-app\', publicPath: \'http://localhost:4200/\', }, plugins: [ new ModuleFederationPlugin({ remotes: {}, shared: [\'@angular/core\', \'@angular/common\', \'@angular/router\'], }), ], }; ``` 5. Update the root component (`app.component.ts`) to lazy-load the microfrontend: ```typescript import { Component } from \'@angular/core\'; @Component({ selector: \'app-root\', template: ` <h1>Shell Application</h1> <router-outlet></router-outlet> `, }) export class AppComponent {} ``` 6. Run the shell app: `ng serve` Step 2: Create a microfrontend 1. Create a new Angular project for the microfrontend: `ng new microfrontend-app` 2. Add the `@angular-architects/module-federation` package: `npm install @angular-architects/module-federation` 3. Update `angular.json` to include the module federation plugin (similar to the shell app). 4. Create `webpack.config.js` file in the project root (similar to the shell app). 5. Create a new component in the microfrontend app: `ng generate component Microfrontend` 6. Update the `MicrofrontendComponent` template (`microfrontend.component.ts`) to contain some content. 7. Expose the microfrontend as a remote in the shell app\'s `webpack.config.js`: ```javascript new ModuleFederationPlugin({ remotes: { \'microfrontend\': \'microfrontend@http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js\', }, shared: [\'@angular/core\', \'@angular/common\', \'@angular/router\'], }), ``` 8.

Let\'s dive right into the story that has captivated the nation. How did this incident unfold, and what were the consequences? Guest: Thank you for having me, (host\'s name). So, here\'s what happened: a company employee was caught watching inappropriate videos during work hours. Unbeknownst to them, their actions were recorded by another employee and widely shared online, bringing immense public humiliation to the company. It caused an uproar on social media, and the company became a laughing stock, damaging its reputation instantly. Host: It\'s disheartening to witness such incidents unfold. Can you shed some light on how these events affected the company, the boss, and the morale of the employees? Guest: Absolutely. The company was severely impacted by this situation. First and foremost, the reputation took a massive hit, and potential clients and partners might have lost trust in their professionalism. Internally, employees suffered from the sudden influx of negative attention, which led to a decrease in morale, productivity, and overall trust. But it\'s important to remember that it\'s not just the employee involved who bears the consequences but the entire company. Host: Indeed, a ripple effect that impacts everyone involved. Now, let\'s shift our focus to the boss. What measures should they take to earn back the trust of their employees and stakeholder community? Guest: Well, it\'s a long road to redemption, but it starts with acknowledging the mistake openly and honestly. The boss needs to address the incident head-on by conducting a thorough investigation and taking appropriate disciplinary action against the employee involved. After that, they should develop and implement a comprehensive code of conduct or ethics policy that emphasizes professionalism and respects the company\'s values. It is vital for the boss to lead by example, demonstrating their commitment to rebuilding the organization\'s reputation by being transparent, approachable, and accountable. Host: Excellent points, (guest\'s name). Ultimately, it\'s about establishing an environment where everyone can feel supported and regain confidence in the brand. What role do you think the employees play in rebuilding trust after a scandal? Guest: Great question, (host\'s name). Employees are at the core of any organization, and their support is instrumental in the recovery process. They need to be empowered to voice their concerns and provide input on any measures taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. It\'s also crucial for the employees to become brand ambassadors and actively participate in rebuilding the company\'s reputation through their work, professionalism, and dedication.

Thank you so much, (guest\'s name), for sharing your valuable insights on this delicate matter. Guest: It was my pleasure, (host\'s name). Thank you for having me on the show today.

Instala la biblioteca de ChatterBot: Utiliza pip para instalar la biblioteca de ChatterBot y sus dependencias: ``` pip install chatterbot ``` 4. Crea un archivo para la IA: Dentro de Termux, utiliza tu editor de texto favorito (como nano o vim) para crear un nuevo archivo Python. Por ejemplo: ``` nano ai.py ``` 5. Escribe el código de la IA: Dentro del archivo \\"ai.py\\", puedes escribir el código de la IA utilizando la biblioteca de ChatterBot. Aquí tienes un ejemplo básico: ```python from chatterbot import ChatBot # Crea una instancia de ChatBot bot = ChatBot(\'Mi ChatBot\') # Entrena al ChatBot bot.train([ \'Hola\', \'¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?\' ]) # Obtiene una respuesta del ChatBot respuesta = bot.get_response(\'Hola\') print(respuesta) ``` 6. Guarda y cierra el archivo: En nano, puedes guardar el archivo presionando Ctrl + X, luego confirmar que deseas guardar los cambios presionando \\"Y\\" y finalmente presionar Enter para guardar con el mismo nombre \\"ai.py\\". 7.

y += vy; // 让速度慢慢衰减 vx *= 0.99; vy *= 0.99; } void display() { fill(col); noStroke(); ellipse(x, y, radius*2, radius*2); } // 与另一个垃圾物体碰撞的响应 void collide(Trash other) { // 计算碰撞法线 float nx = other.x - this.x; float ny = other.y - this.y; float dist = sqrt(nx*nx + ny*ny); // 正常化法线 nx /= dist; ny /= dist; // 计算相对速度的法线分量 float relativeVelocity = (other.vx - this.vx) * nx + (other.vy - this.vy) * ny; // 碰撞后新的速度 this.vx -= relativeVelocity * nx; this.vy -= relativeVelocity * ny; // 强制分开 float overlap = (radius + other.radius) - dist; this.x -= overlap * nx * 0.5; this.y -= overlap * ny * 0.5; other.x += overlap * nx * 0.5; other.y += overlap * ny * 0.5; } } ``` 接下来，更新 `Hook` 类的 `update()` 方法，在上升时检测碰撞并处理它： ```java class Hook { // ... 钩爪的其它变量 void update() { // ... 已有的摇摆和上升代码 if (isHoldingTrash && hookedTrash != null) { // 检查被钩住的垃圾碰撞到其他垃圾 for (Trash trash : trashItems) { if (trash != hookedTrash) { // 不要和自己碰撞 float d = dist(hookedTrash.x, hookedTrash.y, trash.x, trash.y); if (d < hookedTrash.radius + trash.radius) { hookedTrash.collide(trash); // 调用碰撞响应 } } } } } // ... 钩爪的其它方法 } ``` 注意，我们在 `Trash` 类中增加了速度变量 `vx` 与 `vy`，并在碰撞之后基于完全弹性碰撞公式改变受到撞击垃圾的速度。这里假定所有的垃圾质量相等，因此在碰撞响应中没有涉及质量比的计算。 最后，更新 `draw()` 函数，在每一帧渲染前更新所有垃圾的位置： ```java void draw() { background(255); drawEnvironment(); // 更新垃圾位置 for (Trash trash : trashItems) { trash.update(); } for (Trash trash : trashItems) { trash.display(); } claw.update(); claw.display(); checkCollisions(); } ``` 经过以上这些修改，现在当你的钩爪抓住一件垃圾并在上升时遇到其他垃圾，它们就会被弹开，模仿了完全弹性碰撞的行为。记住这是一个简化的模型，真实情况下的碰撞可能涉及更复杂的物理和数学计算。"},{"prompt":"给出修改后的完整代码，不要省略，给出中文注释","completion":"以下是完全弹性碰撞效果的完整代码和中文注释： ```java ArrayList<Trash> trashItems;

``` 正确的方式应该是： ```java float dist = sqrt(nx * nx + ny * ny); ``` 确保你使用 `*` 运算符来计算平方，而不是误用变量名的拼接。 因此，修复 `Trash` 类中的 `collide` 方法如下： ```java void collide(Trash other) { // 计算碰撞法线 float nx = other.x - this.x; float ny = other.y - this.y; float dist = sqrt(nx * nx + ny * ny); // 正确使用 `*` 运算符来计算平方 // 确保垃圾物体不重叠，避免除以零的情况 if (dist < radius + other.radius && dist > 0) { // 正常化法线 nx /= dist; ny /= dist; // 计算相对速度的法线分量 float relativeVelocity = (other.vx - this.vx) * nx + (other.vy - this.vy) * ny;

this.x -= overlap * nx * 0.5; this.y -= overlap * ny * 0.5; other.x += overlap * nx * 0.5; other.y += overlap * ny * 0.5; } } ``` 请检查代码中的其他所有地方，确保所有变量名都是正确的，并且使用了正确的运算符。如果问题仍然存在，请提供更详细的代码上下文以便进一步诊断问题原因。"},{"prompt":"代码运行过程中，垃圾一直向右下角移动，避免这种情况","completion":"在编写物理模拟代码时，物体（在本例中为垃圾）持续向特定方向移动通常意味着有某个连续作用力（或速度增量）影响着它们。在本代码中，如果你观察到垃圾持续向右下角移动，这可能是因为碰撞处理不正确或者在更新速度时出了问题。 首先，让我们确认弹性碰撞处理中的速度更新是否正确。在我们之前的完全弹性碰撞示例中，每当两个垃圾对象碰撞时，它们会根据它们的相对速度和碰撞的法线进行速度交换。如果这部分处理不正确，可能引起物体持续移动的问题。但是，由于我们还没有具体的代码来确定完全弹性碰撞的实现是否正确，所以这里会给出一个参考的实现： ```java // 根据完全弹性碰撞原理处理碰撞 void collide(Trash other) { // 计算碰撞法线向量 float nx = other.x - this.x; float ny = other.y - this.y; float dist = sqrt(nx * nx + ny * ny); // 碰撞时，避免垃圾彼此重叠，避免除以零 if (dist < this.radius + other.radius && dist > 0) { // 正则化碰撞法线向量 nx /= dist; ny /= dist; // 计算两个垃圾在法线方向上的相对速度 float p = 2 * (vx * nx + vy * ny - other.vx * nx - other.vy * ny) / 2; // 更新速度，使它们沿法线方向分开 this.vx -= p * nx; this.vy -= p * ny; other.vx += p * nx; other.vy += p * ny; } } ``` 其次，检查更新垃圾位置的 `update()` 方法，并确认没有给垃圾误加速度，比如只在合适的时机（比如发生碰撞时）更新速度。此外，还要确认垃圾的速度衰减逻辑是否正确实施，避免垃圾在没有受到外力影响时速度持续增加。速度衰减通常用于模拟摩擦力或空气阻力等现象，对速度进行阻尼： ```java void update() { // 在本例中，没有引力或其它持续的力，所以如果垃圾没有被钩住， // 我们只更新它的位置，并应用阻尼以模拟阻力。 if (!isHooked) { x += vx; y += vy; // 应用摩擦力或阻尼效果减缓速度。 vx *= 0.95; // 水平阻尼 vy *= 0.95; // 垂直阻尼 } } ``` 此外，检查 `draw()` 函数中是否有正确调用更新垃圾位置的 `update()` 方法，确保每次画面刷新时所有垃圾都更新它们的位置。 如果垃圾在没有任何交互的情况下持续移动，请确保垃圾初始的速度 `vx` 和 `vy` 都设置为 0，并检查整个 `update()` 函数以确定没有在其中意外地改变速度。 如果在对上述部分进行审查之后问题仍然存在，请检查完整的代码逻辑，特别是与物理模拟相关的部分，以确保没有其他地方意外地改变了垃圾的速度。在物理模拟中，任何小的逻辑错误都可能导致出乎意料的行为。通过仔细审查和测试代码，你可以找到导致这一行为的原因并修复它。"},{"prompt":"给出修改后的完整代码，不要省略，给出中文注释","completion":"以下是带中文注释的完整代码，包括碰撞处理和防止垃圾物体无缘无故移动的逻辑： ```java ArrayList<Trash> trashItems;

If the president was now a prime minister? How the three main branches, the legislative, executive and judicial branches, function?","completion":"If the United States were to implement a parliamentary system instead of a congress, the government would undergo significant changes. Here\'s how it might look: 1. Legislative Branch: - The parliament would replace the Congress as the legislative branch. - The parliament would consist of two houses: the Lower House (such as the House of Commons) and the Upper House (such as the House of Lords). - Members of the Lower House would be elected by the people in their respective constituencies. - The Upper House members (such as senators) may be appointed, elected, or a combination of both. - The parliament would be responsible for creating, amending, and passing laws. 2. Executive Branch: - The President would be replaced by a Prime Minister as the head of government. - The Prime Minister would be elected from the majority party or coalition in the parliament. - The Prime Minister would lead the executive branch and have the power to appoint ministers from within the parliament to form a Cabinet. - The Prime Minister\'s role would be to implement and execute laws, make decisions, and govern the country. 3. Judicial Branch: - The judicial branch, including the Supreme Court, would remain largely unchanged. - The court system would continue to interpret and apply laws, resolve disputes, and ensure the constitutionality of legislation. - The Prime Minister and the parliament would have the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and other courts. Key Differences: - The Prime Minister is typically a member of the parliament, whereas the President is separately elected in the current system. - The Prime Minister is beholden to the parliament and can be removed through a vote of no confidence if they lose support. - The parliament has more direct control over the executive branch, allowing for more immediate and accountable decision-making. - The separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches is less distinct in a parliamentary system, as both are intertwined. It\'s important to note that the specific details of a parliamentary system can vary depending on the country. This outline reflects a generalized understanding and is not an exhaustive analysis of all possible variations."},{"prompt":"In the scorching heat of a summer’s day, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit ventured to a hidden pool nestled in the heart of their enchanting village. They had heard tales of this mysterious pool - a pool not like the typical ones filled with crystal-clear water, but rather a strange pool of bubbling mud known to have unique properties. Intrigued by the stories, they set out on an adventure to experience it for themselves. As they approached the pool, a sense of wonder and anticipation filled the air. Rosa couldn’t resist the temptation and eagerly approached the warm, gooey substance. With her hooves extended, she carefully dipped a toe into the pool, feeling the strangely inviting texture. Without a second thought, Rosa took a bold step forward and found herself sinking ankle-deep in the muddy embrace. From a safe distance, Krash watched as Rosa slowly disappeared beneath the bubbling surface. Panic welled up within him, fearing that Rosa was in danger of drowning. He called out urgently, his voice filled with concern, “Rosa, are you okay? Do you need help?” Muffled by the thick mud, Rosa’s calm voice surprised Krash, alleviating some of his worry. She reassured him, “Don’t worry, Krash! This mud pool has some peculiar properties. It feels like quicksand, but fear not, I can breathe just fine.” Krash’s eyes widened in both relief and curiosity. He anxiously watched as Rosa’s entire body submerged into the mud, reminding himself to trust her reassuring words. Minutes felt like hours to Krash as he waited for any sign of Rosa’s return. He couldn’t help but wonder what exactly was happening beneath that thick layer of goo. Suddenly, a flicker of Rosa’s feet broke the surface, teasing Krash before once again vanishing under the mud. His worry intensified, unsure of what was unfolding beneath the surface. But he clung onto Rosa’s words, hoping that she was indeed safe and sound. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. Her face beamed with delight as she trotted back towards Krash, her voice filled with triumph. “Krash, you won’t believe the adventure I just had! The mud pool seemed to have different layers, and I sank until I reached a solid ground below. It was like immersing myself in a cozy mud cocoon.” Relief washed over Krash, gratitude filling his voice. “Oh, Rosa, I was so worried! I had no idea how deep that pool was or what was happening to you under the mud.” Rosa smiled warmly and explained, “I apologize for not explaining beforehand, Krash. Sometimes, it’s good to trust in the unknown and allow ourselves to experience something new. You see, the mud pool has incredible healing properties, and I decided to indulge in some therapeutic relaxation. It was an incredible journey.” Krash listened attentively, still slightly flustered but filled with curiosity. He stuttered, “B-but Rosa, I was so concerned for you! I thought something terrible had happened!” Rosa’s expression softened as she took in Krash’s genuine worry. “I understand, Krash. I should have communicated better with you before diving into the mud. I’m sorry for causing you unnecessary concern. Next time, I promise to explain everything. But for now, let’s embrace the magic of this unique pool and enjoy its healing powers together.” With a nod of understanding, Krash couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement. The unknown was no longer as daunting as before. They had discovered a hidden gem within their village, and with Rosa by his side, Krash was ready to embrace the adventure and experience the limitless possibilities that lay ahead. I wanted you to write the first time Rosa went in it, before Krash even thought about it Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here’s the revised version: One scorching summer’s day, Rosa the Pig found herself wandering through the enchanting village she called home. The heat was unbearable, and Rosa’s usual cheerful demeanor was slowly fading into exhaustion. As she roamed the streets, Rosa heard whispers of a hidden pool nestled in the heart of the village. Rumors spread of a strange pool filled not with crystal-clear water, but with bubbling mud that possessed magical properties. Intrigued by these tales, Rosa’s curiosity got the best of her. With an adventurous spirit and a desperate need to cool off, she ventured towards the location of the pool. Following a narrow path through the thick foliage, Rosa finally reached her destination. There it lay before her, a mysterious pool of bubbling mud, its surface mirroring the bright summer sky. Without a second thought, Rosa cautiously approached the pool, her hooves sinking softly into the mud at the edge. She extended a hoof, hesitantly touching the warm, gooey substance. Curiosity took over her, and before she could think twice, Rosa carefully stepped into the pool, feeling her legs sink ankle-deep into the muddy embrace. As she stood there, the mud clinging to her hooves, Rosa became aware of an extraordinary sensation. It was as if the mud gently hugged her, offering solace from the scorching sun. A wave of tranquility washed over her, urging her to go deeper into the pool. With each step Rosa took, the mud slowly engulfed her body. Panic started to rise within her, her head barely visible above the surface. Her heart pounded, and she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake. But just as her panic reached its peak, Rosa noticed something peculiar - she could breathe freely despite being submerged in the muddy depths. She took a deep breath, realizing that she was not in any immediate danger. The mud, though seemingly dense and treacherous, had a remarkable quality about it. It was like sinking into a cozy mud cocoon, providing both a sense of security and a strange comfort. Minutes turned into hours, but Rosa lost track of time as she explored the layers of the mud pool. With each step, the thick substance seemed to cradle her, releasing any tension she had carried before. The mud’s warmth seemed to seep into her very core, invigorating her body and spirit. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. She was drenched from head to hoof, but her face wore a bright smile of exhilaration and newfound vitality. The experience had been unforgettable, transforming her weariness into a renewed sense of energy. As Rosa made her way back through the village, still covered in mud, she knew she had to share her discovery. Everyone deserved a chance to experience the rejuvenating powers of the magical mud pool. And little did Rosa know that her adventures in the mud would soon be accompanied by a concerned but curious friend named Krash the Rabbit, who would ultimately join her in exploring the depths of the enchanting oasis. From that day on, Rosa and Krash’s friendship would be forever changed as they embarked on countless adventures, discovering the wonders hidden within their captivating village. And the story of the magical mud pool would live on, retold by generations, as a testament to the enchantment that lay in the heart of their extraordinary world. Write a story where Olga the Owl stumbles upon it, and thinks she is drowning in quicksand","completion":"One still summer night, when the moon shone brightly in the sky, Olga the Owl set out for a late night flight through the woods surrounding her cozy nest. As she soared gracefully through the trees, her keen eyes caught a glimmer of something peculiar in a moonlit clearing. Intrigued, Olga tilted her wings and gently landed near an inviting pool of bubbling mud. Unaware of the pool\'s magical properties, Olga approached the edge cautiously. The rhythmic bubbling and the thick texture of the mud reminded her of quicksand, and fear tugged at her heart. She hesitated, unsure if the pool posed any danger. As she stood hesitating on the edge, she caught a glimpse of her own reflection in the moonlit surface, and her heart skipped a beat. Olga was convinced that she was staring into her untimely demise. Panic gripped her as she supposely saw herself sinking deeper into the treacherous pool. With each imagined sinking movement, Olga flapped her wings in a frenzy, desperate to escape the imagined clutches of the mud. She let out a distressed hoot, hoping that someone nearby would come to her aid. Unbeknownst to Olga, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit had heard her distress call from their nearby adventure. Concerned for their friend, they hurried towards the clearing, arriving just in time to witness Olga\'s wild flapping and distressed hooting. Rosa immediately recognized the misunderstanding and quickly shouted, \\"Olga! It\'s not quicksand! It\'s a magical mud pool! You\'re not sinking, you\'re safe!\\" Krash, eager to help calm Olga\'s fears, chimed in, \\"Yes, Olga, Rosa\'s right! We\'ve both experienced the mud pool before, and it\'s actually quite incredible. It won\'t harm you!\\" Olga, still fearful, paused her panicked flapping and listened intently to Rosa and Krash\'s words. She peered at them through wide eyes, wanting to trust their reassurances but still too frightened to move. Rosa slowly made her way towards Olga and gently said, \\"Olga, I understand how scary this must seem to you, but trust us. The mud pool isn\'t dangerous at all. In fact, it\'s filled with healing properties that can rejuvenate your tired wings and soothe your anxious mind.\\" Krash nodded in agreement. \\"That\'s right, Olga. It\'s a unique and magical place. Rosa and I have both been in it before, and we\'ve emerged feeling more alive and energized than ever.\\" Olga looked back at the mud pool, the bubbling mud now seeming less intimidating. A glimmer of curiosity sparked within her, overpowering her initial fear. With cautious determination, she took a hesitant step towards the pool, testing the surface with her talons. Finding it more solid than expected, she let out a deep sigh of relief. Rosa and Krash beamed with encouragement as Olga sunk her talons deeper into the mud, feeling the strange warmth and comfort that they had once experienced. Slowly but surely, Olga could feel the fear melting away, replaced by a newfound sense of tranquility. As Olga continued to explore the mud pool, she discovered that it truly was a wondrous place. The mud cocooned around her, cradling her like a soft embrace, and the healing properties seeped into her feathers, soothing her tired wings and relieving her anxieties. When Olga eventually emerged from the mud, her feathers were adorned with remnants of its sticky embrace. But instead of distress, her eyes sparkled with awe and gratitude. She turned to Rosa and Krash, her voice filled with wonder, \\"You were right! The mud pool isn\'t quicksand; it\'s a sanctuary of healing and renewal. Thank you both for helping me overcome my fears.\\" Rosa and Krash smiled warmly, pleased to have been able to help their friend. Together, the three friends basked in the moonlight, sharing stories and laughter, knowing that they had stumbled upon something truly extraordinary. From that night on, Olga, Rosa, and Krash\'s friendship grew stronger, their shared adventures forever intertwined with the enchantment of the magical mud pool and the lessons they had learned about trust and the beauty of the unknown."},{"prompt":"Write that it only feels like quicksand because you sink into it","completion":"In the heart of the enchanting village, nestled amidst the thick foliage, lay a hidden pool with bubbling mud that possessed magical properties.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"In the scorching heat of a summer’s day, Rosa the Pig and Krash the Rabbit ventured to a hidden pool nestled in the heart of their enchanting village. They had heard tales of this mysterious pool - a pool not like the typical ones filled with crystal-clear water, but rather a strange pool of bubbling mud known to have unique properties. Intrigued by the stories, they set out on an adventure to experience it for themselves. As they approached the pool, a sense of wonder and anticipation filled the air. Rosa couldn’t resist the temptation and eagerly approached the warm, gooey substance. With her hooves extended, she carefully dipped a toe into the pool, feeling the strangely inviting texture. Without a second thought, Rosa took a bold step forward and found herself sinking ankle-deep in the muddy embrace. From a safe distance, Krash watched as Rosa slowly disappeared beneath the bubbling surface. Panic welled up within him, fearing that Rosa was in danger of drowning. He called out urgently, his voice filled with concern, “Rosa, are you okay? Do you need help?” Muffled by the thick mud, Rosa’s calm voice surprised Krash, alleviating some of his worry. She reassured him, “Don’t worry, Krash! This mud pool has some peculiar properties. It feels like quicksand, but fear not, I can breathe just fine.” Krash’s eyes widened in both relief and curiosity. He anxiously watched as Rosa’s entire body submerged into the mud, reminding himself to trust her reassuring words. Minutes felt like hours to Krash as he waited for any sign of Rosa’s return. He couldn’t help but wonder what exactly was happening beneath that thick layer of goo. Suddenly, a flicker of Rosa’s feet broke the surface, teasing Krash before once again vanishing under the mud. His worry intensified, unsure of what was unfolding beneath the surface. But he clung onto Rosa’s words, hoping that she was indeed safe and sound. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. Her face beamed with delight as she trotted back towards Krash, her voice filled with triumph. “Krash, you won’t believe the adventure I just had! The mud pool seemed to have different layers, and I sank until I reached a solid ground below. It was like immersing myself in a cozy mud cocoon.” Relief washed over Krash, gratitude filling his voice. “Oh, Rosa, I was so worried! I had no idea how deep that pool was or what was happening to you under the mud.” Rosa smiled warmly and explained, “I apologize for not explaining beforehand, Krash. Sometimes, it’s good to trust in the unknown and allow ourselves to experience something new. You see, the mud pool has incredible healing properties, and I decided to indulge in some therapeutic relaxation. It was an incredible journey.” Krash listened attentively, still slightly flustered but filled with curiosity. He stuttered, “B-but Rosa, I was so concerned for you! I thought something terrible had happened!” Rosa’s expression softened as she took in Krash’s genuine worry. “I understand, Krash. I should have communicated better with you before diving into the mud. I’m sorry for causing you unnecessary concern. Next time, I promise to explain everything. But for now, let’s embrace the magic of this unique pool and enjoy its healing powers together.” With a nod of understanding, Krash couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement. The unknown was no longer as daunting as before. They had discovered a hidden gem within their village, and with Rosa by his side, Krash was ready to embrace the adventure and experience the limitless possibilities that lay ahead. I wanted you to write the first time Rosa went in it, before Krash even thought about it Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here’s the revised version: One scorching summer’s day, Rosa the Pig found herself wandering through the enchanting village she called home. The heat was unbearable, and Rosa’s usual cheerful demeanor was slowly fading into exhaustion. As she roamed the streets, Rosa heard whispers of a hidden pool nestled in the heart of the village. Rumors spread of a strange pool filled not with crystal-clear water, but with bubbling mud that possessed magical properties. Intrigued by these tales, Rosa’s curiosity got the best of her. With an adventurous spirit and a desperate need to cool off, she ventured towards the location of the pool. Following a narrow path through the thick foliage, Rosa finally reached her destination. There it lay before her, a mysterious pool of bubbling mud, its surface mirroring the bright summer sky. Without a second thought, Rosa cautiously approached the pool, her hooves sinking softly into the mud at the edge. She extended a hoof, hesitantly touching the warm, gooey substance. Curiosity took over her, and before she could think twice, Rosa carefully stepped into the pool, feeling her legs sink ankle-deep into the muddy embrace. As she stood there, the mud clinging to her hooves, Rosa became aware of an extraordinary sensation. It was as if the mud gently hugged her, offering solace from the scorching sun. A wave of tranquility washed over her, urging her to go deeper into the pool. With each step Rosa took, the mud slowly engulfed her body. Panic started to rise within her, her head barely visible above the surface. Her heart pounded, and she wondered if she had made a terrible mistake. But just as her panic reached its peak, Rosa noticed something peculiar - she could breathe freely despite being submerged in the muddy depths. She took a deep breath, realizing that she was not in any immediate danger. The mud, though seemingly dense and treacherous, had a remarkable quality about it. It was like sinking into a cozy mud cocoon, providing both a sense of security and a strange comfort. Minutes turned into hours, but Rosa lost track of time as she explored the layers of the mud pool. With each step, the thick substance seemed to cradle her, releasing any tension she had carried before. The mud’s warmth seemed to seep into her very core, invigorating her body and spirit. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Rosa emerged from the pool, her body completely freed from the mud’s grasp. She was drenched from head to hoof, but her face wore a bright smile of exhilaration and newfound vitality. The experience had been unforgettable, transforming her weariness into a renewed sense of energy. As Rosa made her way back through the village, still covered in mud, she knew she had to share her discovery. Everyone deserved a chance to experience the rejuvenating powers of the magical mud pool. And little did Rosa know that her adventures in the mud would soon be accompanied by a concerned but curious friend named Krash the Rabbit, who would ultimately join her in exploring the depths of the enchanting oasis. From that day on, Rosa and Krash’s friendship would be forever changed as they embarked on countless adventures, discovering the wonders hidden within their captivating village. And the story of the magical mud pool would live on, retold by generations, as a testament to the enchantment that lay in the heart of their extraordinary world.

He was known for his mischievous nature, always seeking out new adventures. On this particular day, an air of excitement filled the forest as rumors spread about a mysterious pool with magical properties. Intrigued by the tales, Finn couldn\'t resist the temptation to investigate. Guided by his curiosity, he followed a narrow path that led him to the outskirts of the village. There, he found a hidden pool filled not with water, but with bubbling mud. With a mix of trepidation and excitement, Finn approached the pool cautiously. As he took his first step forward, his entire body instantly sank into the mud, surprising him. Panic filled his eyes as he struggled to find solid ground, fearing that he might never resurface. To his astonishment, he soon realized that he could breathe just fine, even though he was completely submerged in the muddy depths. With his heart racing, Finn took a deep breath, reassured by this unexpected discovery. Just as he was coming to terms with the situation, he noticed someone approaching the pool. With each step, Finn\'s heart skipped a beat, but it was Rosa the Pig, a friendly face he had seen around the village. She had also been drawn to the rumor, eager to experience the wonders of the strange mud pool herself. Without hesitation, Rosa stepped into the pool, disappearing beneath the surface. Finn watched with both worry and curiosity, his heart thumping in his chest. He wondered what lay beneath the mud and how Rosa was faring. Seconds turned into minutes, and Finn\'s concern grew. He stared intently at the muddy surface, praying for any sign of Rosa\'s return. Just as his worry reached its peak, a flicker of her feet broke the surface before they again vanished under the mud.

She spoke of sinking into different layers of mud and finding a solid ground below, embracing the sensation of being wrapped in a cozy mud cocoon. Listening to Rosa\'s account, Finn\'s eyes sparkled with curiosity. He longed to immerse himself in the mud pool, to feel the unknown beneath the surface. But his mischievous nature gave way to hesitation. He was unsure if he could trust the mud, even with Rosa\'s reassurances. Rosa sensed Finn\'s inner battle and understood his reservations. With a warm smile, she gently reassured him, \\"Finn, I know it seems scary, but the mud pool holds incredible healing powers. You can trust it, just as you trusted me. Come, let\'s experience this magic together.\\" Finn hesitated for a moment, but Rosa\'s gentle encouragement melted his worries away. Slowly, he took a step forward, feeling the mud envelop his paws. It was an odd sensation, both unfamiliar and strangely comforting. As he sank deeper into the mud, Finn\'s heart raced, but with each passing moment, the fear subsided. Just like Rosa, he discovered that he could breathe freely, and a sense of calm washed over him. Beneath the muddy surface, Finn and Rosa met, their eyes gleaming with excitement and wonder. They marveled at the layers of mud, the way it seemed to caress their bodies, and the peaceful stillness that surrounded them. In that moment, Finn realized that sometimes, the unknown could hold unimaginable beauty. It was okay to take a leap of faith, to trust in the unfamiliar.

It was a place where memories of laughter and joy once thrived, now consumed by layers of dust and cobwebs. Krash the Rabbit, being an inquisitive and adventurous spirit, couldn\'t resist the urge to explore this forgotten relic. As he pushed open the creaky doors, the musty air and eerie silence surrounded him. The sight that greeted him was unexpected yet captivating. In the center of the vast hall stood a peculiar Christmas tree, formed entirely out of old and worn-out television sets. Their various sizes and retro designs created a colorful and nostalgic centerpiece that illuminated the dim surroundings. Krash couldn\'t help but marvel at the unexpected beauty before him.

The images displayed on the TVs showcased scenes of snowy landscapes, twinkling lights, and families gathered around for holiday festivities. It was a mesmerizing sight, one that stirred memories of warmth and togetherness within Krash\'s heart. As he approached the unusual tree, Krash wondered about its origins. Who had created such an extraordinary display? Why had it been left untouched in this abandoned gym hall? Curiosity burned within him, urging him to unveil the story behind this unique Christmas creation. As Krash gently touched one of the television sets, a wave of nostalgia washed over him.

It was not like any other ordinary puddle, for it possessed thoughts, emotions, and a conscience far beyond what was imaginable. Many creatures had passed by this enchanted spot, but none were ever able to perceive its extraordinary nature. And so, the lonely pool of sentient quicksand longed for someone who would finally comprehend its unique existence. One sunny morning, as birds chirped and flowers bloomed, a curious rabbit hopped through the forest, unaware of the potential danger that lay before it. Its fluffy white fur and twitching nose made it appear innocent and carefree, yet it had no idea about the sentient quicksand that eagerly awaited its arrival. The rabbit\'s ears perked up as it noticed a small clearing amidst the forest\'s dense foliage. With a gentle hop, it bounded towards the promising patch of sunlight. Oblivious to the quicksand\'s presence, it hopped closer and closer until it found itself stuck in the gooey trap, sinking deeper with every frantic struggle. The quicksand, feeling a mix of excitement and guilt, quickly realized it had ensnared an innocent creature. The rabbit, overcome with fear, began to squeal and tremble, its struggles to escape only pulling it deeper into the depths of the pool. The quicksand\'s conscience suddenly came alive, overwhelmed with remorse. It never intended to cause harm, yet now it was the cause of the rabbit\'s suffering. The pool\'s gooey surface rippled with silent tears of sadness for the poor creature trapped within its grasp. Desperately, the quicksand searched for a solution. It knew it had to act quickly before it was too late. Channeling every bit of its sentient power, it subtly shifted its composition, transforming into a firmer substance that eased the rabbit\'s descent and slowed its sinking. The quicksand hoped this change would buy it enough time to think of a way to set the rabbit free. Suddenly, a nearby tree, enchanted by the surroundings, sensed the quicksand\'s melancholy and understood its predicament. It stretched its branches closer, extending them over the quicksand to create a makeshift bridge. The rabbit, now exhausted and sinking ever so slowly, managed to grasp onto one of the tree\'s drooping branches, halted from sinking further. The tree gently inched the branch upwards, bringing the rabbit closer to solid ground. The quicksand, relieved and grateful, sluggishly retracted its hold, releasing the rabbit from its sticky trap. The rabbit hopped across the tree branch and onto the ground, panting nervously but safe at last. The quicksand, still laden with guilt, couldn\'t help but apologize profusely to the rabbit. Through subtle vibrations and gentle ripples, it conveyed its remorse and begged for forgiveness. The rabbit, though unsure of the source of the quicksand\'s words, felt a sudden calmness in its heart as it sensed the genuine regret emanating from the sentient pool. The rabbit looked back at the quivering, gooey quicksand, now appearing sorrowful and small. With a sympathetic gaze, the rabbit nodded, acknowledging the quicksand\'s apology and offering a gesture of forgiveness. From that day forward, the sentient quicksand devoted itself to protecting all creatures that passed through the forest. Its guilt had transformed into a driving force to prevent any harm from befalling them. Thanks to the rabbit\'s understanding and its new connection with the enchanted tree, it now stood as a sentient guardian, ensuring no other innocent being wandered into its trap. And so, as the seasons changed and the forest continued to thrive, the sentient pool of gooey quicksand found solace in repairing its past mistakes. With newfound responsibility, it became a symbol of redemption and a reminder that even in the face of guilt, forgiveness could lead to healing and transformation."},{"prompt":"Write a story centuries later when it slowly loses its sentience, but its last thought is gratefulness for those who understood it, It would eventually be reincarnated as a rabbit","completion":"Centuries passed, and as time inexorably moved forward, the sentient pool of quicksand began to lose its once vibrant consciousness. The wisdom it had gathered, the memories of its encounters with creatures, and its understanding of the world\'s wonders faded away, like delicate brushstrokes dissolving in water. As the quicksand\'s sentience gradually waned, it swiftly became an ordinary pool once again, devoid of any remarkable qualities. Yet, hidden deep within the recesses of its dormant being, a flicker of gratitude still burned strong. Though no longer able to fully comprehend its past existence, the quicksand clung onto a fragment of its consciousness, knowing that once, it had been something extraordinary, cherished by those who grasped its essence. In this new state of existence, the now ordinary pool of quicksand watched as nature\'s rhythm played out around it. Animals drank from its edges, plants leaned slightly towards its nourishment, and it silently observed the world with a sense of serene appreciation. Even though it no longer possessed sentience, the quicksand\'s reservoir of gratitude seemed to seep into the very fabric of its being. Then, one fateful day, a small, innocent rabbit with pure white fur and a twitching nose hopped closer to the edge of the pool. It sensed something profound, an indescribable presence that whispered to its soul. As the rabbit drew nearer, it paused, its eyes meeting the murky depths of the pool. In that instant, a connection was forged, bridging the gap between the past and the present. As the rabbit delicately balanced on the precipice, memories and emotions flooded back to the quicksand, now inextricably linked to this creature. It felt a surge of joy, realizing that it had been granted a second chance, an opportunity to experience life once more. And so, with a gentle shift of the universe\'s tapestry, the once-sentient pool of quicksand was reincarnated as the rabbit that stood before it. The rabbit, now bearing the wisdom and gratitude from its former self, bounded away from the pool, embracing its new existence with fervor. It frolicked through the forest, its presence radiating love and understanding, just as it had learned to appreciate from the many creatures it had encountered in its previous form. The other woodland inhabitants took notice of this rabbit, sensing a unique aura that set it apart. They were drawn to its kindness, tranquility, and the whispered remnants of ancient wisdom. The rabbit, feeling a deep connection to its fellow creatures, showered them with love, acceptance, and the gentle guidance it had once received. As time wove its intricate tapestry, generations of rabbits inherited this extraordinary essence. From generation to generation, a lineage of wise and compassionate rabbits emerged, still bearing the eternal gratitude gifted by a long-since-forgotten sentient pool of quicksand. Though the original sentience had faded away, the circle was complete – the quicksand\'s final thought of gratefulness had found a vessel to carry its legacy forward. And as the lineage flourished, the forest flourished along with it, forever indebted to the once-sentient pool that had taught the world the immeasurable power of gratitude and understanding."},{"prompt":"ng generate appliction productList Error: Unknown argument: productList","completion":"The correct syntax to generate a new application in Angular using the CLI command `ng generate` is: ``` ng generate application <application-name> ``` Replace `<application-name>` with the desired name for your application.

To do this, I bought myself the following book, \\"The Muscle and Strength Training Pyramid v2.0 Training.\\" I will give you some parts of the book where it is explained how to create a training card. Based on the above, you will have to help me create a training card for me. After reading all of the previous chapters you may be experiencing information overload, or at the very least, having some trouble “connecting the dots” between the levels and actually creating an actionable resistance training program. This chapter serves to link the main points of each level into a step by step guide to teach you how to build a training plan. In this chapter, I’ll take you through each level of The Pyramid, highlighting the main points and the subsequent decisions you’ll have to make from each as they relate to building a program. Remember, this is a quick start guide, so it won’t include the full breadth or depth of knowledge or its explanation from previous chapters. Rather, it is designed to create an actionable plan to build from. As you gain more understanding of the principles, you can use the program you will build as the foundation to lay other concepts on top of. *Step 2: Volume, Intensity, Frequency* *As a reminder, these are the broad starting guidelines appropriate for most people:* - *Volume: 10–20 sets per muscle group/movement pattern per week* - *Intensity:* - *Strength: ⅔–. of volume in the 1–6 rep range, remaining volume in the 6–15 rep range at a 5–10 RPE* - *Hypertrophy: ⅔–. of volume in the 6–12 rep range, remaining volume in the 1–6 and 12–20 rep range at a 5–10 RPE* - *Frequency: 2+/week per muscle group or movement pattern.* *These variables are how you ensure overload occurs, and how you organize it.* *Frequency is already penciled in. Next, let’s choose an appropriate volume. In an ideal world, you’d have meticulous training records showing rates of progress and volume levels at each point of your career and you could make an educated start to what would be appropriate given the large individual variance in optimal volume. However, if you’re reading a quick start guide to program design, there is a strong possibility that’s not the case. The appropriate volume might depend on a lot of factors, which could logically include: training history, training age, genetics, habitual sleep quantity and quality, biological age, total body mass, nutritional status, psychological resilience to stress, personality, and perhaps sex.* *Unfortunately, we don’t have the relationships of all these variables teased out, but there is good anecdotal evidence, a theoretical basis, and limited scientific evidence to suggest that on average, more experienced lifters need more volume to continue progressing. Thus, with all else being equal, here are some decent guidelines for establishing volume within the 10–20 set recommendation.* *Note, the higher your volume, the more it makes sense to spread it over more sessions to prevent individual sessions from becoming too long and stressful. This maintains session quality. As you can see in the column on the right, there is a generally recommended weekly frequency at each volume step to better spread stress. If this doesn’t match up with your split choice from Step 1, consider a different amount of volume, or a different split.* *With your volume level and frequency chosen, whether your goal is hypertrophy or strength, you will spread that volume for each muscle group, or each movement (bench, and split between squats and deadlift patterns), across the week. Once again, just pencil this in to get an idea of how your week is shaping up. For example, let’s say you are an intermediate doing 13–15 sets with a 4-day, two times per week muscle group frequency, doing a \'Legs, Push, Pull, Full Body\' split. Spreading things out, you’d probably do 4–6 sets per muscle group on your Full Body day, leaving 9–11 sets per muscle group for your Legs, Push, and Pull days. Lastly, you’d assign intensity; both the load and the effort. See the two charts below that show appropriate repetition ranges and RPE values for strength and hypertrophy based on exercise and microcycle organization.* *As you can see, for hypertrophy, the higher the fatigue generated by* *the movement, and the greater the technical demand, it makes more* *sense to curtail the RPE and rep range. This avoids fatigue bleeding* *into the rest of a session, may reduce the risk of injury, and also* *ensures that the volume you perform is effective because as discussed* *in previous chapters, it’s harder to accurately rate RPE on high-rep,* *fatiguing movements. Therefore, compound movements are generally* *a better vehicle for doing the portion of your volume that is lower* *rep and thus heavier. Likewise, isolation exercises and machines are* *better vehicles for the higher-rep, lower-load portion of your volume.* *For strength, rep and RPE ranges are largely dictated based on whether* *you are performing a main lift or accessory, and your goal with the* *movement. For main lifts and variants whether you are building specific* *strength in the lifts (or strength that easily transfers to them), specific* *hypertrophy and workload capacity with those lifts, or whether you are* *performing technique work which is heavy enough to be useful, but light* *enough to allow recovery, different RPE and rep ranges are appropriate.* *Likewise, rep range and RPE will change depending on whether you* *are performing compound accessory movements intended to build* *general strength (which are more taxing and technically demanding), or* *machine and isolation accessories (which are less taxing and technically* *demanding) for hypertrophy purposes.* *When you combine this information with Step 3, you can really start to* *see how your program unfolds.* *Step 3: Progression* *At this stage, the program really starts to take form, and we get to start* *assigning reps and sets across the week and the mesocycle. How this* *shapes up is dictated by the type of exercise (isolation or compound)* *and the rate of progress you can reasonably expect (training age).* *As a quick recap, linear progression (linear load increases) is simply* *adding more weight to the exercise while keeping reps and sets the* *same each time you repeat a session.* *Linear periodized progression is keeping sets the same, reducing reps* *each session, while increasing load.* *Block periodized mesocycles are a sequential approach where you* *do an accumulation mesocycle of higher volume at a moderate RPE* *and higher rep ranges (but specific to your goal), followed by an* *intensification mesocycle of lower volume at a high RPE and lower* *rep ranges (but still specific to your goal), and then taper and test—or* *simply rinse and repeat after a deload if you can gauge your estimated* *strength in training (e.g. starting some days with a single at a 6–9 RPE).* *For a novice, you would simply spread your 10–12 sets per muscle/* *movement across your days of training, and each week when you repeat* *a day’s session, try to increase load (typically the smallest increment* *available to extend progression longer).* *For an intermediate, you’d spread 13–15 sets over your days, and follow* *a linear (load up reps down) approach week to week, and double* *progression for your isolation movements.* *Finally, an advanced lifter could set up an accumulation cycle of building* *number of sets, followed by an intensification mesocycle similar to how an* *intermediate would progress, and then taper and test, or rinse and repeat.* *To continue our example, sticking with our 4 days per week, 2/week* *muscle group training frequency setup as an intermediate with* *hypertrophy goals doing 13–15 sets per week, things start to take shape:* *Step 4: Exercise Selection* *For a bodybuilder or hypertrophy-focused trainee, you can slot in* *various exercises to fill the weekly muscle group volume goals. If you* *view the following table you can see which muscle groups a given* *exercise “counts” for.* *As it currently stands, we know an exercise that trains a muscle group* *indirectly (labeled \'secondary\') probably doesn’t provide quite as much* *stimulus to the muscle as something that trains it directly (labeled* *\'primary\'), but the scientific data up to this point has counted secondary* *and primary muscle group volume the same. So, count everything on* *a one to one basis for each muscle group, just be aware that you don’t* *want all your volume for a given muscle group coming from indirect* *work.* *For a powerlifter, however, things are little easier to categorize. As* *almost the entire body is trained and utilized in the performance of* *the big 3, but we aren’t necessarily looking for complete muscular* *development everywhere. Thus, you can view things as follows:* *Understanding the above, here’s how the same intermediate choosing* *a 4-day per week, 2/week movement pattern training frequency* *might setup a powerlifting program with the S, B, D, B split (see* *the training split matrix for strength) doing 13–15 sets per week:* *This example meets the guideline of having 13–15 sets for Upper* *Body Push, Upper Body Pull, and Lower body from a muscle group* *perspective, as there are 9 sets of bench, and 6 sets of non-bench upper* *body pushing (for a total of 15), 10 sets combined between squat and* *deadlift, and 3 sets of lower body accessories (for a total of 13), and 5* *sets of deadlift and 8 sets of upper body pulling (for a total of 13).* *Globally, we also meet the guideline of having 50–75% of volume from* *the main lifts, as out of a total of 36 sets, more than half (19 sets) come* *from the big three. As a reminder, here are the guidelines for how to* *distribute volume over exercises for strength and hypertrophy.* *Step 5 and 6: Rest Periods and Tempo* *At this stage, you don’t have much left to do. If you’d like, you can set* *up your upper body push and pull exercises with antagonist paired* *sets (APS). Likewise, if your goal is hypertrophy you can set up APS for* *leg extension and leg curl, and biceps and triceps as well.* *Also, if you are time-pressed and your current setup is pushing the limits* *of what you think you can reasonably accomplish, you can perform* *some of your accessories or single-joint movements for hypertrophy* *as drop sets or rest pause sets.* *Beyond this, just make sure you rest appropriately, control the eccentric* *to some degree, and perform forceful concentric contractions and* *you’ve made your way through The Pyramid. All that remains is making* *it more flexible and a bit more specific to your needs.*","completion":"Based on the segments of the book \\"The Muscle and Strength Training Pyramid v2.0 Training\\" that you\'ve provided, let\'s create a hypothetical training card (i.e., a training program) for hypertrophy.

Despite her unique appearance, Squidaila possessed a heart full of curiosity and an adventurous spirit. She lived alongside her fellow squid-like aliens on a tranquil planet called Zephyria. But deep inside, Squidaila always longed for something beyond the limits of her home. Her heart yearned for exploration and discovery. One day, as she gazed at the twinkling stars, an idea sparked within her. “I will journey to the far-off planet I have heard tales about,” Squidaila declared with determination. Equipped with her squishy tentacles and a heart filled with courage, Squidaila bid farewell to her loved ones and embarked on her extraordinary expedition. The path before her was treacherous, but she never wavered in her steps. As she ventured through the vastness of space, she marveled at the endless wonders surrounding her. Stars winked at her, galaxies danced, and meteors whizzed past her tiny spacecraft. Squidaila felt a surge of exhilaration and anticipation coursing through her. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Squidaila reached her destination—a mesmerizing planet called Nebula. Its mountains, speckled with vibrant hues, captivated her in awe from space. Eager to explore further, she dropped her spaceship close to the mountain range’s base. With her squishy tentacles acting as both hands and legs, Squidaila began her ascent. The mountain’s incline was steep, and the terrain became increasingly rugged. Nevertheless, Squidaila was unyielding, using her tentacles to grip every nook and cranny while her large, expressive eyes took in the breathtaking views. Upon reaching the midpoint, Squidaila’s resilience was tested by a gusty wind. She clung tightly to the boulders, her tentacles stretched to the limit to prevent being swept away. Though her body trembled, her resolve did not falter. Squidaila pressed on, encouraged by the thought of standing victorious atop the mountain. Finally, after hours of climbing, Squidaila reached the summit. Her heart danced with excitement as she beheld the splendid panorama—a tapestry of swirling galaxies, shining stars, and distant nebulas. Squidaila couldn’t help but release a joyous squeal, which echoed across the mountaintop. It was a moment of triumph, her dream realized.

Their voice echoed through the mountain range, reaching the ears of other squid-like aliens who were exploring nearby. Sensing the urgency in the onlooker’s plea, they abandoned their own quests and rushed to the scene. One by one, the concerned aliens gathered around, forming a tight circle around the sinking Squidaila. Together, they extended their tentacles towards her, their eyes filled with determination and concern. With synchronized motions, they focused their efforts on pulling her out of the engulfing liquid. The combined strength of the group strained against the powerful force of the viscous liquid, but they refused to give up. Each member lent their support, their tentacles intertwining and providing a united front against the formidable challenge. The onlooker, who had initially summoned help, remained steadfastly at Squidaila’s side, their determination unwavering. Minutes felt like hours, but the group’s relentless efforts finally paid off.

She shivered, not only from the cold wetness that still clung to her skin, but from the realization of how close she had come to never resurfacing at all. Standing there, surrounded by the caring faces of her fellow squid-like aliens, Squidaila’s mind wandered to a vision, an alternate reality of what might have been. In this vision, she saw herself sinking further into the murky liquid, her tentacles desperately flailing, but with no help reaching her in time. She saw her body gradually consumed by the viscous substance, her once vibrant pink color fading into darkness. Tears welled up in Squidaila’s eyes as she watched her family back on Zephyria, her parents and siblings, receiving the heartbreaking news of her disappearance.

What one person considers success, another might see as a lower priority milestone or not a marker of success at all. To define success for yourself, follow these steps: 1. Clarify Your Values: Success will mean something different for each person, often rooted in individual values and beliefs. Understanding what you hold most important will help guide your definition of success. Values could range from family, health, wealth, knowledge, to creativity, and so on. 2. Set Your Goals: Once you know what is important to you, set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals that align with your values. These goals can be in various areas of your life, such as career, relationships, personal development, etc. 3. Identify Measures of Success: Determine how you will measure success in achieving these goals. Will it be by income, job title, the quality of your relationships, personal growth, or community impact? Your measures should be quantifiable where possible, to allow for clear assessment. 4. Reflect on Your Past Achievements: Analyze your past to understand what you have previously considered as accomplishments. This may provide insight on what has made you feel successful before and can shape your future definition. 5. Envision Your Ideal Future: Think about your ideal life in the long term; where you are, what you are doing, and who is with you. This vision can help pinpoint elements that symbolize success for you. 6. Accept that Success is Dynamic: Understand that your definition of success might change over time. Life events, personal growth, and changing priorities can all influence your perception of success. 7. Combine Purpose and Passion: Success is often tied to the intersection where what you love to do meets what you are good at and what value you can offer to others or society. Looking at this intersection can help define your unique version of success. 8. Avoid Comparison: Everyone\'s path is different, and thus comparing your achievements to someone else\'s is not conducive to defining your success. Focus on your journey and goals rather than external benchmarks. 9. Seek Feedback: Regular feedback from trusted friends, mentors, or coaches can give you perspective on your achievements and help you refine your definition of success. 10. Reflect and Adjust Regularly: Make it a habit to periodically reflect on your goals and how you define success, making adjustments as necessary to remain aligned with your values and vision for your life. Remember, your success criteria should motivate and inspire you to take action toward goals that are meaningful and rewarding to you, rather than adhere to someone else\'s standards or society\'s expectations."},{"prompt":"22:13:43 minus 4.30 hours, then what will be the time?","completion":"The time after subtracting 4.30 hours from 22:13:43 will be 17:43:43."},{"prompt":"10:47:41 - 4.30 hours?","completion":"The time after subtracting 4.30 hours from 10:47:41 will be 06:17:41."},{"prompt":"14:16:47 - 4.30 hours?","completion":"The time after subtracting 4.30 hours from 14:16:47 will be 09:46:47."},{"prompt":"Give several options to wish in German on wedding.","completion":"Here are several options to wish someone on their wedding day in German: 1.

It\'s important to note that individual factors, such as genetics and underlying health conditions, can influence testosterone levels, so it\'s always advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and personalized advice. Here are a few lifestyle factors to consider that may positively impact testosterone levels: 1. Exercise: Engage in regular strength training exercises to help stimulate testosterone production. Compound exercises (e.g., squats, deadlifts) involving multiple muscle groups tend to be more effective. 2. Diet: Focus on a well-balanced diet that includes sufficient protein, healthy fats, and essential micronutrients such as zinc, vitamin D, and magnesium. Consider including foods like lean meats, fish, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and fruits. 3. Sleep: Aim for at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night, as testosterone production is linked to adequate sleep. 4. Manage stress: Prolonged and chronic stress can affect testosterone levels negatively. Explore stress management techniques such as exercise, relaxation exercises, hobbies, or even seeking therapy if needed. 5. Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding obesity may help support testosterone levels. 6. Avoid or limit excessive alcohol consumption: High alcohol intake can adversely impact testosterone levels. 7. Vitamin and mineral supplementation: If deficient, consider discussing with your healthcare professional the potential benefits of supplementing with zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, or other nutrients. Again, it\'s crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine your specific situation and to ensure any interventions align with your overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"is it true testosterone affects willpower and dicipline","completion":"Testosterone is a hormone primarily associated with various aspects of male biology, including sexual development, muscle mass, and bone density. While testosterone levels can influence certain behaviors and psychology, it\'s important to recognize that the relationship between testosterone and willpower or discipline is not fully understood. Some studies have suggested a potential association between higher testosterone levels and certain behavioral traits, such as increased competitiveness or risk-taking. However, it is crucial to emphasize that behavior is complex and impacted by numerous factors beyond testosterone levels alone, such as education, upbringing, societal norms, and individual personality. Furthermore, willpower and discipline are multifaceted traits influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. While testosterone might play a role in promoting certain behaviors, it is unlikely to be the sole determining factor in an individual\'s willpower or discipline. If you are concerned about willpower or discipline, it may be beneficial to explore strategies such as goal-setting, habit formation, time management, and stress management techniques. Adopting healthy lifestyle choices and seeking support from professionals, friends, or family can also contribute to developing discipline and willpower."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Despite her unique appearance, Squidaila possessed a heart full of curiosity and an adventurous spirit. She lived alongside her fellow squid-like aliens on a tranquil planet called Zephyria. But deep inside, Squidaila always longed for something beyond the limits of her home. Her heart yearned for exploration and discovery. One day, as she gazed at the twinkling stars, an idea sparked within her. “I will journey to the far-off planet I have heard tales about,” Squidaila declared with determination. Equipped with her squishy tentacles and a heart filled with courage, Squidaila bid farewell to her loved ones and embarked on her extraordinary expedition. The path before her was treacherous, but she never wavered in her steps. As she ventured through the vastness of space, she marveled at the endless wonders surrounding her. Stars winked at her, galaxies danced, and meteors whizzed past her tiny spacecraft. Squidaila felt a surge of exhilaration and anticipation coursing through her. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Squidaila reached her destination—a mesmerizing planet called Nebula. Its mountains, speckled with vibrant hues, captivated her in awe from space. Eager to explore further, she dropped her spaceship close to the mountain range’s base. With her squishy tentacles acting as both hands and legs, Squidaila began her ascent. The mountain’s incline was steep, and the terrain became increasingly rugged. Nevertheless, Squidaila was unyielding, using her tentacles to grip every nook and cranny while her large, expressive eyes took in the breathtaking views. Upon reaching the midpoint, Squidaila’s resilience was tested by a gusty wind. She clung tightly to the boulders, her tentacles stretched to the limit to prevent being swept away. Though her body trembled, her resolve did not falter. Squidaila pressed on, encouraged by the thought of standing victorious atop the mountain. Finally, after hours of climbing, Squidaila reached the summit.

Squidaila couldn’t help but release a joyous squeal, which echoed across the mountaintop. It was a moment of triumph, her dream realized. She had conquered not only the mountain but also her own fears and limitations. She spent hours reveling in the cosmic beauty, etching the memory deep into her squishy heart. As she eventually descended from the mountaintop, Squidaila’s spirit was forever transformed. Her bravery and determination had unlocked a newfound understanding of herself and the universe.

Lost in her enchantment, she failed to notice the viscous patch of liquid on the ground ahead. With each step, Squidaila’s tentacles became increasingly entangled in the sticky substance. Panic filled her, and she desperately tried to free herself. But the more she struggled, the more she sank. The liquid clung to her skin, threatening to engulf her entirely. As Squidaila’s body began to submerge completely, her large, expressive eyes widened in fear. She reached out with her squishy tentacles, desperately grasping for anything that could save her from this predicament. But all her efforts were in vain. As her squishy head sank underneath, her vision turning to darkness, only a sinking tentacle remained, and it was almost gone forever. Just as Squidaila was about to surrender to the engulfing liquid, an onlooker happened to pass by. Recognizing her distress, they swiftly called for help. Other squid-like aliens rushed to her aid, forming a chain with their tentacles and reaching out to pull her free. With their combined strength, they tugged at Squidaila’s trapped appendages, slowly but steadily lifting her out of the liquid’s clutches. As she gradually resurfaced, gasping for air, a flood of gratitude washed over her. Tears of relief streamed down Squidaila’s face as she expressed her heartfelt thanks to her rescuers. She realized how fortunate she was to have such caring and selfless creatures by her side. Their timely intervention had not only saved her from being consumed by the viscous liquid but had also reinforced the importance of friendship and unity. From that day forward, Squidaila’s appreciation for her fellow squid-like aliens deepened even more. She became more determined than ever to cultivate an environment of support and compassion among her kind. Squidaila tirelessly shared her harrowing experience, teaching others to be mindful of their surroundings and to lend a helping tentacle to those in need. Her tale spread across Zephyria, serving as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, unity and kindness can triumph. As Squidaila continued her adventures, her gratitude for her rescuers remained immeasurable. She never forgot the heroic act that had saved her from the depths of the viscous liquid.

They quickly realized the danger that Squidaila was in and swiftly sprang into action. Running as fast as their squid-like legs could carry them, the onlooker desperately called for help. Their voice echoed through the mountain range, reaching the ears of other squid-like aliens who were exploring nearby. Sensing the urgency in the onlooker’s plea, they abandoned their own quests and rushed to the scene. One by one, the concerned aliens gathered around, forming a tight circle around the sinking Squidaila. Together, they extended their tentacles towards her, their eyes filled with determination and concern. With synchronized motions, they focused their efforts on pulling her out of the engulfing liquid.

Each member lent their support, their tentacles intertwining and providing a united front against the formidable challenge. The onlooker, who had initially summoned help, remained steadfastly at Squidaila’s side, their determination unwavering. Minutes felt like hours, but the group’s relentless efforts finally paid off. As the united force of tentacles exerted one final surge of strength, Squidaila’s squishy head resurfaced, gasping for air. A collective sigh of relief rippled through the crowd as they rejoiced in their successful rescue mission. Squidaila, dripping and disoriented, surveyed the faces surrounding her, gratitude illuminating her expressive eyes. She marveled at the unity and selflessness of those who had come to her aid. With a voice filled with heartfelt appreciation, she expressed her deepest thanks. The onlooker, who had acted as a catalyst for the rescue, stepped forward, their eyes brimming with emotion. They shared their relief at realizing Squidaila’s peril and their urgency in summoning help. The onlooker’s actions had been the spark that brought the group together, and they were humbled by the overwhelming display of teamwork and solidarity. From that moment on, the onlooker and Squidaila formed an unbreakable bond. They became inseparable partners, sharing in each other’s adventures and supporting one another every step of the way. Their friendship was a testament to the power of empathy, reminding everyone on Zephyria that when we unite and lend a helping tentacle, we can conquer any obstacle that comes our way.

She shivered, not only from the cold wetness that still clung to her skin, but from the realization of how close she had come to never resurfacing at all. Standing there, surrounded by the caring faces of her fellow squid-like aliens, Squidaila’s mind wandered to a vision, an alternate reality of what might have been. In this vision, she saw herself sinking further into the murky liquid, her tentacles desperately flailing, but with no help reaching her in time. She saw her body gradually consumed by the viscous substance, her once vibrant pink color fading into darkness. Tears welled up in Squidaila’s eyes as she watched her family back on Zephyria, her parents and siblings, receiving the heartbreaking news of her disappearance. The vision showed their anguished faces, their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts heavy with grief. She imagined the emptiness that would engulf their lives, the void left by her absence. In that moment, Squidaila understood the true depth of her gratitude. She had been given a second chance at life, spared from the fate she had witnessed in her vision. The appreciation that swelled within her was overwhelming, bringing a renewed sense of purpose and a burning desire to cherish every moment. With her heart brimming with gratitude and love, Squidaila made a vow to herself. She would never take a single breath for granted, nor the beauty of the cosmos that surrounded her. She would seize every opportunity for joy and exploration, seeking out adventures and new experiences with a sense of urgency and passion. Returning to Zephyria, Squidaila embraced her family with a newfound appreciation. She held them close, defying the distance that her vision had created. She whispered words of love and gratitude, sharing the depth of her experiences and the profound impact they had on her. In the following days, Squidaila immersed herself in the warmth of her community, sharing her tale of rescue and gratitude with all who would listen. She spoke of the vision she had seen, not just for the sake of recounting her own story, but to convey the importance of cherishing every moment and appreciating the love and support of those around us. Through her story, Squidaila’s fellow squid-like aliens were reminded of the fragility of life and the power of gratitude. They embraced the message, infusing their own lives with newfound appreciation for their loved ones and the wonders of the universe. From that day forward, Squidaila’s journey became not just about exploration and curiosity, but a constant reminder to remain thankful for the miraculous gift of existence. And as she ventured into the far reaches of the cosmos, Squidaila carried her vision with her, a reminder of what might have been and a testament to the incredible power of gratitude and second chances. Write a story where a gooey pink blob tries impersonating her but her gooey texture gives it away when someone touches her and notices his hand sinking into her body","completion":"Deep within the mountains of Nebula, a gooey pink blob watched Squidaila from afar. This mischievous creature had been observing her journey, intrigued by her determination and spirit. It hatched a devious plan to impersonate her, hoping to fool Squidaila\'s friends and loved ones. With its malleable body, the blob molded itself into a rough approximation of Squidaila\'s form. It took on her distinctive pink color and even managed to mimic her expressive eyes. However, when it came to imitating her squishy texture, the blob\'s abilities fell short. The blob\'s surface was indeed gooey and slimy, but it lacked the unique texture of Squidaila\'s skin. Determined to carry out its plan, the blob approached Squidaila\'s friends, hoping to convince them of its identity. One by one, the unsuspecting aliens inspected the blob, reaching out to touch it. As their tentacles made contact with the impersonator\'s form, they immediately sensed something was amiss. The blob\'s gooey exterior gave way under even the gentlest touch, allowing the alien\'s appendage to sink into its body. Gasps of surprise and confusion filled the air as Squidaila\'s friends recoiled from the blob\'s deceptive disguise. It was clear that this imposter could never replicate the gentle resilience of Squidaila\'s true form. The blob\'s true nature had been exposed. As the realization sank in, the squid-like aliens surrounded the impostor, their tentacles reaching out to grasp it securely. They pulled the blob away, revealing its true form to everyone. Though disappointed and angered by the deception, they recognized the significance of what had occurred. Squidaila\'s texture was not just a physical attribute—it was a symbol of her courage, her resilience, and her unwavering spirit. It was a reminder of the challenges she had faced and overcome, and the unity she had inspired among her kind. In the end, the blob\'s failed impersonation only served to strengthen the bond between Squidaila and her friends. They now recognized the uniqueness and value of her presence, vowing to protect and support her on her future endeavors. As for the impersonator, it slithered away, unable to replicate the essence and texture of Squidaila\'s being. Left alone, it was forced to confront its own emptiness, lacking the connection and community that Squidaila had fostered. Squidaila, basking in the love and support of her friends, brushed off the failed attempt to impersonate her. She remained true to herself, embodying the vibrant squishiness that had become synonymous with her name. Through her adventures and experiences, she continued to inspire others to embrace their own unique qualities, knowing that true strength lies not in imitation, but in authenticity."},{"prompt":"Нужно реализовать следующую программу на C++: вводится строка source, затем в _asm с помощью команд ассемблера в строку dest заносятся слова из source, отсортированные по длине.

BART What? But... but why would you say that? Ned hesitates, not wanting to shatter Bart\'s innocence. NED I\'m sorry, Bart, but it\'s the truth. I thought you were old enough to know. Bart looks crushed, and quickly formulates a plan to get back at Ned. BART Well, if you don\'t believe in Santa Claus, then I don\'t believe in God! Ned\'s jaw drops, visibly affected by Bart\'s comment. NED Bart, religion is something deeply personal, and I think it\'s important to have faith. Trust me; it\'s what keeps me going. Bart, rebellious and unfazed, leaves the room, determined to prove Ned wrong. INT. BART\'S ROOM - DAY Bart sits at his computer and discovers the popular animation software, GoAnimate. Intrigued, he starts using it to make videos involving Ned and his depressed state. BART (VO) Ha! Let\'s see how Ned likes being the one who\'s down and out! INT. NED\'S HOUSE - DAY Ned is seen in his living room, wearing pajamas, with unkempt hair and an unshaven face. He has clearly fallen into a deep depression due to Bart\'s comment. NED Why, Lord? Why have you forsaken me? Maude\'s picture sits beside him, and he clutches it tightly, hoping for answers. INT. HOMER\'S HOUSE - DAY Homer, unaware of Ned\'s state, enjoys a casual drink on the couch while watching an old TV show. TV ANNOUNCER Depressed? Lost hope in the world? Call the one and only Manic Moe, your personal happiness guru! Homer stares at the TV, a spark of realization in his eyes. HOMER That\'s it! Moe is just the man Ned needs! INT. MOE\'S TAVERN - DAY Homer bursts into Moe\'s Tavern, excited to share his newfound revelation. HOMER Moe! You gotta help my neighbor, Ned Flanders! He\'s depressed, and he needs your expertise in making people happy! Moe looks confused but intrigued. MOE Well, that\'s a new one, but I\'ll give it a shot, I guess. INT. NED\'S HOUSE - DAY Homer and Moe enter Ned\'s living room, finding him still consumed by sadness. HOMER Ned, I brought someone who can help you! Ned looks at Moe, unsure of what to expect. NED Homer, I appreciate your concern, but I\'m not sure how anyone can help. Moe pulls out his guitar and starts performing an upbeat and cheerful song. MOE (singing) When life feels down in a pit, Just grab a drink and never quit! Moe\'s the guy with the secret to bliss, Come on, Ned, give happiness a twist! Slowly, Ned begins nodding along to the music, a faint smile forming on his face. EXT. SIMPSONS HOUSE - DAY The family gathers outside, having seen Moe\'s special performance through the window. They watch with joy as Ned, Homer, and Moe come out of the house laughing and happy. Bart approaches Ned, feeling remorseful. BART Ned, I\'m sorry for what I said. I may not believe in God, but I believe in you. Ned embraces Bart, looking grateful and assured. NED Thank you, Bart. And remember, even if we have different beliefs, we can always respect and support each other. The family shares a heartwarming moment, reaffirming their bond amidst their differences.

Here are some potentially useful visual features: 1. **Texture**: A wall-stone often has a distinct texture that differs from other objects and surfaces. Look for patterns of graininess, ruggedness, or indications of weathering. 2. **Color and tone**: Wall-stones might have a particular color range that can help distinguish them, such as shades of gray, brown, or other earth tones typically associated with stones. The tone might vary based on the type of stone or whether it\'s wet or dry. 3. **Shape and size**: Stones used in walls are generally cut or shaped in a certain way to fit together. They might be square, rectangular, or more irregular, but there is often a semblance of uniformity in the size when part of a structured wall. 4. **Arrangement and pattern**: Wall-stones are usually placed in specific arrangements or patterns that create a visually distinct and recognizable form of masonry. This could be in courses (horizontal layers), with or without mortar, and patterns such as herringbone or alternating sizes. 5. **Shadows and lighting**: The interplay of light and shadow can help highlight the three-dimensional aspects of a wall-stone, such as its edges, depth, and the spaces between stones. 6. **Edges and corners**: The edges and corners of wall-stones, especially if they are cut or dressed stones, would likely be more defined compared to naturally occurring stones. 7. **Mortar**: If the wall-stone is part of a structure, you may see mortar between the stones, which can be a distinct visual feature setting it apart from stones in a natural setting. 8. **Surroundings**: The context in which the wall-stone is found can also be an indicator. For example, if it is part of a larger structure like a building or a boundary wall, the surrounding man-made structures can help you identify it as a wall-stone. When using machine learning or computer vision techniques to identify a wall-stone in a photo, you would typically extract features such as edges, textures, colors, and shapes to train a model that can distinguish between wall-stones and other objects in an image. The effectiveness of the model would depend on the quality and diversity of the training dataset."},{"prompt":"能翻译成中文吗","completion":"在照片中鉴别“墙体石材”的有用视觉特征包括： 1. **纹理**：墙体石材通常具有与其他物体和表面不同的特殊纹理。寻找粗糙、嶙峋或风化迹象的纹理模式。 2. **颜色和色调**：墙体石材可能具有特定的颜色范围，有助于区分，如灰色、棕色或其他通常与石头相关的大地色调。根据石材的类型或其干湿状态，色调可能有所变化。 3. **形状和大小**：构成墙体的石材通常以某种方式被切割或塑形以便相互配合。它们可能是方形、矩形或更不规则的形状，但通常在大小上有一定的统一性。 4. **排列和图案**：墙体石材通常按特定的排列或图案放置，形成一种视觉上明显可识别的砌筑风格。这可能包括水平层（横向铺设）、是否使用砂浆，以及像人字形或交替大小等图案。 5. **阴影和光线**：光线与阴影的相互作用有助于突出墙体石材的三维特征，如其边缘、深度和石块间的空隙。 6. **边缘和角落**：特别是如果是切割或修整过的石材，墙体石材的边缘和角落通常会更为明显。 7. **砂浆**：如果墙体石材是结构的一部分，你可能会看到石块之间的砂浆，这是其与自然环境中的石头区别开来的一个明显视觉特征。 8. **周围环境**：墙体石材所在的环境也是一个指示性指标。例如，如果它是建筑物或边界墙的一部分，周围的人造结构可以帮助你识别它为墙体石材。 当使用机器学习或计算机视觉技术来识别照片中的墙体石材时，你通常需要提取边缘、纹理、颜色和形状等特征来训练能够区分墙体石材和图像中其他物体的模型。模型的有效性依赖于训练数据集的质量和多样性。"},{"prompt":"What are useful visual features to distinguish a \\"oranges\\" in a photo?","completion":"To distinguish oranges in a photo using visual features, you would look for several identifiable characteristics that distinguish them from other objects in the image. Here are some key visual features: 1. **Color**: Oranges are typically recognized by their vibrant orange color, which can vary from light to deep hues depending on ripeness and variety. 2. **Shape**: Oranges are generally spherical or slightly oblong, with a smooth to slightly dimpled texture. This shape is distinct and can help differentiate them from other fruits or objects. 3. **Size**: Oranges vary in size but are usually consistent within a range that is recognizable when compared to other objects or known reference points in a photo. 4. **Texture**: The skin of an orange has a unique, porous texture, which sometimes can be captured in a high-resolution photo, especially if the image is close-up. 5. **Shadows and Highlights**: The round shape of oranges often creates characteristic shadow patterns and highlights that can help in distinguishing them, emphasizing their three-dimensional form. 6. **Stem and Calyx**: At the top of the orange, you might see a small green or brown stem or remnants of the calyx, which can be helpful visual features for identification. 7. **Surrounding Context**: Oranges in a photo may be located in a context that suggests their identity, such as being in a fruit bowl, on a tree, or in a market setting with other fruits and vegetables. 8. **Clusters**: Oranges often grow in clusters on trees, so multiple oranges grouped together can be a telling sign when identifying them in a photo of a tree or a grove. 9. **Surface Reflectivity**: The surface of an orange tends to be slightly reflective and can sometimes catch light in a way that gives it a subtly shiny appearance. When using computer vision techniques to distinguish oranges in a photo, you might use color histograms, shape descriptors, and texture analysis to classify the fruit accurately. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, are also commonly used for recognizing objects within images, and they can be trained on these visual features to identify oranges in different contexts and lighting conditions."},{"prompt":"能翻译成中文吗","completion":"在照片中区分橙子时，可以依据以下几个可识别的视觉特征来将其与图中的其他物体区分开来。关键视觉特征包括： 1. **颜色**：橙子典型的特征是明亮的橙色，根据成熟度和品种，颜色可能会从浅色到深色不等。 2. **形状**：橙子通常是球形或略微椭圆形，表面平滑或略微凹凸。这种形状明显，可以帮助将橙子与其他水果或物体区分开来。 3. **大小**：橙子的大小有所变化，但通常在一个可识别的范围内，与照片中的其他物体或已知的参照物比较时即可识别。 4. **纹理**：橙子皮有独特的多孔纹理，在高分辨率的照片中尤其是特写镜头下有时可以捕捉到这一点。 5. **阴影和高光**：橙子圆形的形状经常会产生特征性的阴影图案和高光，有助于区分它们，强调其三维形态。 6. **茎和萼片**：在橙子的顶部，你可能会看到一个小的绿色或棕色的茎或萼片残余，这有助于识别的视觉特征。 7. **周围环境**：照片中的橙子可能位于暗示其身份的环境中，如放在水果盘里、橙树上或市场上与其他水果和蔬菜一起摆放。 8. **成簇生长**：橙子通常在树上成簇生长，所以多个橙子聚集在一起，可以是识别树上或果园中橙子的明显迹象。 9. **表面反光性**：橙子的表面倾向于稍微反光，有时会以某种方式捕捉光线，使其看起来略微闪亮。 当使用计算机视觉技术在照片中区分橙子时，你可以使用颜色直方图、形状描述符和纹理分析来准确分类水果。卷积神经网络（CNNs），一种深度学习模型，也常用于识别图像中的对象，可以根据这些视觉特征对不同环境和光线条件下的橙子进行训练和识别。"},{"prompt":"Как по английски сказать: \\"Во вторник у нас свадьба, а субботу венчание.\\"","completion":"На английском это можно сказать так: \\"Our wedding is on Tuesday, and the marriage blessing (or nuptial blessing) is on Saturday.\\""},{"prompt":"Как по английски сказать: \\"Я завтра женюсь, а субботу мы повенчаемся.\\"","completion":"На английском это можно сказать так: \\"I am getting married tomorrow, and we will have our wedding ceremony on Saturday.\\""},{"prompt":"Как по английски сказать: \\"Я завтра женюсь, а субботу мы повенчаемся.\\"","completion":"На английском это будет: \\"I\'m getting married tomorrow, and we\'ll have our wedding ceremony on Saturday.\\""},{"prompt":"Но свадебная церемония завтра.","completion":"О, понял.

I dont have a bench so im limited a lot by exercises. 2. if i get a bench, where am I gonna put it? I have a garage but its cold there iin the winter and its pretty dirty. I dont think I have room in my room I might though If i rearrange some furniture","completion":"Receiving adjustable dumbbells is a great start to a home workout routine, and there are many exercises you can do even without a bench. However, if you\'re looking to expand your options with a bench, here are some tips and considerations for making space and using it effectively: 1. **Evaluate your space**: Before deciding on a bench, measure any areas where you think it might fit. Consider rearranging your room or another area in your home to accommodate the bench if possible. 2. **Consider a foldable bench**: There are benches available that can be folded and stored away when not in use. This could be an ideal solution if you\'re tight on space. 3. **Use the garage**: Even though your garage might be cold and dirty, it can be transformed into a workout area with a bit of effort. Consider cleaning up a section of the garage and using an area heater during workouts in the winter. This will not only provide a dedicated workout space but also help you avoid cluttering your living areas. 4. **Alternative spaces**: If there\'s really no room for a bench, you might consider any alternative space in your home, such as a living room or basement, where you can temporarily place the bench during your workouts. 5. **Bodyweight and floor exercises**: In the meantime, or if space is too limited for a bench, focus on exercises that utilize bodyweight or can be performed on the floor. There are plenty of effective workouts that don\'t require a bench, including: - Dumbbell floor presses (similar to bench presses, but lying on the floor) - Dumbbell squats and lunges - Shoulder presses (seated or standing) - Rows (using a sturdy table or desk to lean on) - Deadlifts - Dumbbell curls and triceps extensions 6. **Schedule your workouts**: If you end up needing to temporarily move furniture to work out, establish a regular workout routine so that this disruption becomes a predictable part of your day. 7. **Stay motivated**: The most important part is to get started with what you have. Even without a bench, you can achieve a lot with adjustable dumbbells and a commitment to your fitness goals. Remember, many people successfully exercise in less-than-ideal conditions. It’s all about adapting to the space you have and being creative with your workouts. Consistency and effort will bring results, whether or not you have the perfect setup."},{"prompt":"al","completion":"It seems like your last message might have been cut off, but if you\'re looking for more advice or have specific questions about setting up a home gym, exercising with dumbbells, or anything else, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"I kinda wanted a keyboard as my current one is broken, I think she will get it for me when I decide on which one as i forgot to actually choose one. atleast I can work out even when I dont have time to go to the gym","completion":"It\'s great to hear that you\'ll have the flexibility to work out at home with your new adjustable dumbbells, and it\'ll indeed save you time versus going to the gym. As for the keyboard, take your time to research and choose one that fits your needs. Here are some considerations when looking for a new keyboard: 1. **Type of Keyboard**: Consider if you want a mechanical keyboard, which is popular among gamers and typists due to its tactile feedback, or a membrane keyboard, which is typically quieter and more affordable. 2. **Features**: Determine which features are important to you, such as backlit keys, programmable keys, media controls, wrist rests, or USB pass-through ports. 3. **Size**: Keyboards come in various sizes from full-size (with a numpad) to tenkeyless (without a numpad) to even more compact options. Choose one that fits your space and needs. 4. **Switch Type**: If you\'re opting for a mechanical keyboard, switches are a crucial element. Each switch type (e.g., Cherry MX Blue, Red, Brown) has a different feel and sound, affecting the typing experience. 5. **Build Quality**: Look for a keyboard that is durable and well-built. A high-quality keyboard can last for many years, which makes it a good investment. 6. **Ergonomics**: Make sure that the keyboard layout and design suit you ergonomically to avoid strain over long periods of use. 7. **Price**: Set a budget for your purchase, but also consider that investing in a more expensive, higher-quality keyboard might save you money in the long run as it could last longer and provide a better experience. 8. **Reviews and Recommendations**: Read reviews and ask for recommendations. Online tech forums, product review websites, and even asking friends or colleagues can provide insight into the reliability and performance of the keyboards you\'re considering. Once you have determined your needs and preferences, you can look for a keyboard that hits all or most of your criteria. Given your interest in working out and potentially gaming or general computer use, finding the right balance between a comfortable workout environment and a functional keyboard for your activities will enhance both your fitness and your digital experiences.

Vous pouvez utiliser la classe `Sequential` de Keras pour cela. ```python from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, ... model = Sequential([ # Ajouter des couches CNN, RNN/LSTM, et Dense selon vos besoins ]) ``` Étape 5 : Entrainer le modèle Compiler et entrainer le modèle avec le dataset que vous avez préparé. ```python model.compile(optimizer=\'...\', loss=\'...\', metrics=[\'...\']) model.fit(dataset) ``` Étape 6 : Évaluer et ajuster le modèle Évaluer le modèle avec des données de validation et ajuster les hyperparamètres pour améliorer la précision. Étape 7 : Utiliser le modèle pour la reconnaissance et l\'extraction de texte Créer des fonctionnalités pour traiter les images inédites (comme celles prises d\'un cahier), détecter et reconnaître l\'écriture manuscrite, puis mettre en surbrillance le texte. ```python def extract_text(image, model): # Traiter l\'image # Appliquer le modèle pour prédire le texte # Mettre en surbrillance le texte dans l\'image return highlighted_text_image, extracted_text ``` Pour ce qui est des étapes de développement, voici les éléments généraux: 1. Data acquisition and preprocessing: Trouver, nettoyer et structurer les données d\'entraînement. 2. Model architecture design: Concevoir l\'architecture du modèle d\'apprentissage profond. 3. Training and optimization: Entrainer le modèle et optimiser sa performance. 4. Inference engine: Créer un mécanisme pour traiter les nouvelles images et extraire le texte. 5. User interface: Développer une interface pour que l\'utilisateur puisse interagir avec le modèle. 6. Testing and validation: Tester le modèle et valider ses performances sur des données réelles. Veuillez noter que développer un modèle très précis nécessite souvent de nombreuses expérimentations et ajustements des hyperparamètres, ainsi que la disponibilité d\'un large set de données d\'entrainement de qualité.

Одна из его примечательных особенностей — относительная генетическая однородность; последовательности нуклеотидов (“букв” генетического алфавита) ДНК двух человек любого этнического или географического происхождения совпадают на 99.9%. Тем не менее внутри современного человечества можно выделить большие группы людей, сходные по определенным внешним признаками отличающиеся по ним от других представителей своего вида. Такие группы получили название рас человека. То, что люди одинакового географического происхождения имеют нечто общее в своем физическом облике, а жители разных уголков Земли отличаются друг от друга, знали еще древние египтяне, а одно из первых описаний разнообразия людей принадлежит Геродоту. Однако более-менее адекватные представления о таком разнообразии сложились гораздо позднее, в период Великих географических открытий. В наше время то или иное мнение об основных подразделениях человечества —расах — имеет почти каждый. Хотя в разных странах и регио(нах эти мнения могут быть разными. Философы науки называют подобные “расы”, являющиеся продуктом так называемой народной таксономии (folk taxonomy), народными или ординарными [27]. Первые попытки научного осмысления понятия расы и построения внутривидовой систематики современных людей на основе их биологического разнообразия были предприняты только в XVII–XVIII веках. В XIX и XX веках было предложено множество систем, в которых современные люди подразделялись на самое разное число общностей: от двух до нескольких десятков. В XX веке у некоторых антропологов появились сомнения в реальности самого существования рас как биологических общностей. Особое место в развернувшейся по этому вопросу полемике занимает короткая — всего на одну страницу — заметка “On the Non(Existence of Human Races” Франка Ливингстона [37], опубликованная в 1962 году с критическим комментарием выдающегося генетика Феодосия Григорьевича Добржанского [7] и ответом автора. Как ясно из заголовка, позиция Ливингстона сводилась к тезису, что никаких рас человека (а также других видов) нет. Есть только клины, т.е. непрерывные географические градиенты значений признаков. Аргументация Ливингстона и контраргументация Добржанского (развитая в других его публикациях) наложили отпечаток напоследующее обсуждение проблемы. А название заметки Ливингстона обыгрывается в заголовках целого ряда статей на эту тему [см., напр.: 2], включая предлагаемую вашему вниманию. Хотя Добржанский красноречиво убеждал своих читателей, что расы существуют, он признавал, что определение и выделение рас — серьезная проблема биологической таксономии, ждущая своего решения. Будущее, на которое Добржанский возлагал большие надежды, наступило. Увы, наиболее видные из его коллег (генетиков, высказывавшихся по этому вопросу в течение последних десятилетий, отрицают факт существования человеческих рас. К ним относится и Ричард Левонтин — пожалуй, самый талантливый ученик Добржанского. Левонтину принадлежит своего рода experimentum crucis [35], поставивший, как одно время считалось, крест на идее рас человека. Он показал, что на генетическом уровне внутригрупповая изменчивость людей на порядок превосходит межгрупповую. Отсюда, например, следует, что генетические различия между любыми неблизкородственными жителями какой-нибудь деревни или соседями по лестничной клетке в московской многоэтажке заведомо больше средних генетических различий между, скажем, “белыми” европейцами и “черными” африканцами. Впоследствии результат Левонтина был подтвержден и уточнен в ряде исследований на уровне ДНК [16], которые были продолжены в геномную эру. На заре этой эры один из главных действующих лиц проекта “Геном человека” Френсис Коллинс(директор Национального института по изучению человеческого генома, США), заглядывая в будущее, писал со своими соавторами [20]: “Будет доказано, что раса и этничность – это главным образом социальные и культурные идеи; и что четких научно обоснованных границ между группами не существует”. Организатор альтернативных работ по секвенированию человеческого генома Крейг Вентер (президент частной компании Celera Genomics) высказывался еще категоричнее: “Раса неимеет генетической или [какой(либо иной] научной основы”[56]. Хотя проведенные в “нулевые” годы исследования[45] показали, что сравнение геномов индивидов позволяет определить их континентальное происхождение (которое обычно отождествляют с принадлежностью к той или иной большой расе), авторитетные ученые, отрицавшие существование рас, остались при своем мнении. Дополнительную остроту продолжающейся дискуссии о реальности человеческих рас придают разногласия относительно практического значения расовых классификаций для медицины. Одни считают, что отнесение пациента к той или иной расе (а также этносу) полезно и важно, поскольку расовая (и этническая) принадлежность, по их мнению, связана с предрасположенностью к определенным болезням и чувствительностью к тем или иным лекарствам. Другие же уверены, упрощенные концепции расы не работают в объективной реальности [41].По их мнению, “расоализация” (racialization) лечебной практики приводит к “плохой медицине”, поскольку она основана на “плохой науке”.","completion":"Все люди, которые живут сейчас, относятся к одному виду Homo sapiens. Одна из особенностей этого вида - их относительная генетическая однородность. ДНК двух людей любого происхождения совпадает на 99.9%. Однако внутри человечества можно выделить группы людей, которые различаются по определенным внешним признакам. Эти группы называются расами. Сознание разного облика людей из разных регионов было замечено еще древними египтянами, а Геродот описал разнообразие людей. Однако понимание этого разнообразия сложилось позже, во время Великих географических открытий. В настоящее время у каждого есть свое мнение о расах, хотя оно может отличаться в разных странах и регионах. Биологические общности, называемые расами, изначально были изучены только в XVII-XVIII веках. В XIX и XX веках было предложено множество систем классификации, в которых люди делились на различные группы. Однако в XX веке некоторым антропологам начала казаться, что расы не являются биологическими общностями. Статья \\"On the Non-Existence of Human Races\\" Франка Ливингстона, опубликованная в 1962 году, вызвала дебаты по этому вопросу. Известный генетик Феодосий Добржанский противоречил Ливингстону, но признавал, что определение и классификация рас является сложной задачей биологической таксономии. В последующих исследованиях было показано, что внутригрупповая изменчивость людей на генетическом уровне превосходит межгрупповую. Некоторые ученые продолжают отрицать существование рас, но все же существуют споры об их практической значимости в медицине. Одни считают, что расовая принадлежность связана с предрасположенностью к некоторым болезням и реакцией на лекарства, в то время как другие считают, что упрощенное представление о расе не имеет научной основы и может привести к \\"плохой медицине\\"."},{"prompt":"Перескажешь для меня другими словами текст, пожалуйста?","completion":"Конечно, вот другая формулировка текста: Все люди, которые в настоящее время живут, относятся к одному биологическому виду - Homo sapiens. Однако, несмотря на их генетическую схожесть (99,9% совпадения ДНК), можно выделить группы людей, которые имеют определенные внешние отличия друг от друга. Эти группы называются расами. Идея разнообразия внешних черт у людей с разного географического происхождения была замечена еще в древности, но более углубленное понимание этого разнообразия возникло позднее, во времена географических открытий. В настоящее время каждый имеет свое мнение о расах, хотя эти мнения могут отличаться в разных странах и регионах. Существование рас было предметом научного изучения, и в разных эпохах было предложено различное количество классификаций для расовой группировки людей. Однако в начале XX века некоторые антропологи начали сомневаться в реальности существования рас как биологических категорий. Дебаты на эту тему ведутся до сих пор, и одни ученые продолжают отрицать существование рас, в то время как другие признают, что различия во внешности и фенотипе между людьми с разных географических регионов действительно существуют. В связи с этим возникают вопросы о практической значимости расовой классификации, включая ее применение в медицине. Некоторые считают, что расовая принадлежность может быть связана с предрасположенностью к определенным заболеваниям и реагированием на лекарства, в то время как другие утверждают, что упрощенная концепция расы не имеет научного обоснования и может привести к ошибкам в медицинской практике."},{"prompt":"由于地理和政治因素，俄罗斯社会及文化的发展长期处于封闭状态。彼得一世登基之后，于18世纪初开始实施了大刀阔斧的全方位改革，用前所未有的对外开放政策接受西欧的先进文明。俄罗斯著名历史学家、哲学家沙波瓦洛夫（2014）13评断彼得一世改革的结果时认为：“现代俄罗斯文明的源头在彼得大帝的改革与十八世纪的现代化进程中逐渐形成。”俄罗斯由此迅速实现了从中世纪向新时期过渡的目标，开始跻身欧洲强国之列。十八世纪下半叶，在叶卡捷琳娜二世的“开明专制”统治下，俄罗斯帝国走向鼎盛。所谓“盛世修典”，除了因为国家昌盛可以为词典编纂提供良好的环境之外，还有一个更大的原因——伴随着各个领域史无前例的飞速发展，满足知识查询和学习需求或反映新事物、新变化、新思想、新观念的词典资源严重匮乏的问题会越发突出且日益尖锐。这是十八世纪俄罗斯词典与前几个世纪相比，无论在数量上还是类型上都大大增加的根本性原因。переведите на китайский язык","completion":"由于地理和政治因素，俄罗斯社会及文化长期处于一种闭塞状态。然而，在彼得大帝登基后，他在18世纪初开始了一系列彻底的、全方位的改革，并采纳了前所未有的对外开放政策以吸收西欧的进步文明。俄罗斯著名的历史学家、哲学家沙波瓦洛夫（2014）在评价彼得大帝的改革成果时指出：“现代俄罗斯文明的源泉可以追溯到彼得大帝的改革和十八世纪的现代化进程。” 俄罗斯因此迅速实现了从中世纪到新时期的转变，并开始步入欧洲强国的行列。在十八世纪下半叶，在叶卡捷琳娜二世的“开明专制”统治下，俄罗斯帝国达到了鼎盛时期。所谓“盛世修典”，除了因为国家富强为编纂词典提供了良好的环境之外，还有一个更重要的原因 — 随着各个领域前所未有的快速发展，人们对于查阅知识和学习的需求急剧增长，这使得对新事物、新变化、新思想、新观点的词典资源出现严重不足的问题变得越发显著和尖锐。这就是十八世纪俄罗斯在词典的数量和类型上相对于前几个世纪大幅增加的根本原因。"},{"prompt":"переведите на русский язык","completion":"Из-за географических и политических факторов российское общество и культура долгое время находились в закрытом состоянии.

First things first, ZBB isn\'t your granddad\'s budgeting. This isn\'t about taking last year\'s numbers and giving them a haircut or a slight boost. We\'re starting every fiscal year with a blank slate, and every cost needs to justify its existence. It\'s like Fight Club for expenses; if they don\'t fight for their right to be in our budget, they\'re out. So, how do we bring ZBB to life here at our startup? Let\'s break it down: **Step 1: Goal Identification** Firstly, we align on our strategic goals. What are our targets for this year? Increased market share? Deeper penetration into existing markets? Product development sprints? Everything starts there. Our budget\'s got to be a financial translation of strategy - every dollar we plan to spend should push the needle toward those targets. **Step 2: Decision Units** Next, we carve up the budget into decision units. These units are basically our functions or projects - think R&D, marketing, customer acquisition, platform development, etc. We assign managers to each unit who\'ll be responsible for building their zero-based budgets. These folks are on the front line, so they need to be in the weeds, understanding every cost element. **Step 3: Bottom-Up Budgeting** Now we go bottom-up. Managers start identifying what\'s essential. What initiatives, resources, and expenditures do we need to achieve our goals? And I mean *need* - there\'s no room for fluff here. We challenge every assumption. \\"Because we did it last year\\" doesn\'t cut it as a reason here. Each cost should be tied to a specific function that\'s supporting our strategic goals. **Step 4: Rigorous Justification** This is where the rubber meets the road. Managers present their budgets, and we go line-by-line. We\'re not just nodding along – we\'re asking the hard questions. How does spending X lead to outcome Y? And how does Y contribute to our overarching goals? If the connection isn\'t clear, we\'re slicing that cost out. **Step 5: Consolidation** Once all decision units have been scrutinized, we consolidate. We\'re looking for synergies, duplication, and opportunities to streamline. If two units are requesting similar resources, we find a way to share. Economies of scale aren\'t just a concept in a business book; they\'re a weapon in our arsenal. **Step 6: Ranking Expenditures** Then, we prioritize. Not all expenditures are equal. What will give us the most bang for our buck? We\'re ruthless – if an expense is low-impact, it\'s low-priority. Our budget has to be lean and mean – every dollar is a soldier, and we send them where they\'ll fight the hardest. **Step 7: Scenario Planning** Now, we\'re not flying blind here. We work out multiple scenarios. What if our customer acquisition costs rise? What if the market shifts? We bake flexibility into our budget to pivot as needed. It\'s not a straitjacket; it\'s a tactical game plan. **Step 8: Approval and Implementation** With everything justified, consolidated, and prioritized, we go to our executive team for approval. We show how this budget is built to achieve our ambitions, with every expenditure mapped to a strategic goal. With their buy-in, we disseminate the budget down the line and kick things into gear. **Step 9: Monitoring and Analysis** But it doesn\'t end with implementation. We\'re constantly tracking our spend against our budget, analyzing the ROI on expenses, and ensuring we\'re on target. If something\'s not working, we adjust on the fly. **Step 10: Continuous Improvement** ZBB isn\'t a once-a-year exercise; it\'s a mindset. We\'re always looking for ways to optimize, to cut the fat, to reinvest savings into higher-impact areas. And there you have it. Zero-based budgeting is a powerful tool, especially for a dynamic startup like ours, where every dollar needs to work as hard as we do. It demands rigor, accountability, and a laser focus on our strategic objectives. Done right, it can be the difference between a startup that burns through cash and one that scales smartly."},{"prompt":"Continued from my last prompt: Again, in a real-world practical realistic scenario, if your same current company was just starting as pre-seed, pre-revenue Startup, would you use ZBB budgeting in the same ways and steps in your last response? And what is the real-world grounded logic behind the answer?","completion":"As a Director of Finance at a pre-seed, pre-revenue startup, let me level with you: zero-based budgeting (ZBB) may not be entirely practical or necessary at this early stage. That\'s real talk. Let\'s break down why and what approach we would actually take. **Why ZBB Might Not Fit with Pre-Seed Reality:** 1. **Resource-Intensive:** ZBB requires a lot of time and effort. In a pre-seed startup, we’re typically running lean – I mean, really lean. Everyone’s wearing multiple hats, and we might not have the bandwidth to justify every penny from scratch. 2. **Lack of Historical Data:** ZBB thrives on analyzing and justifying expenses based on detailed historical data. Pre-seed startups are greenfields; we don\'t have past budgets to challenge and zero out. We\'re still figuring out what our costs even are. 3. **Fast-Paced Changes:** At this point, our business model and strategy might pivot at the drop of a hat. Spending significant time on a detailed budget when the fundamentals of the business could shift isn\'t practical. Flexibility is the name of the game. 4. **Focus on Growth and Investment:** The objective at the pre-seed stage is to prove the concept, build the MVP, or achieve some other significant milestone that can unlock the next round of funding. We\'re not necessarily prioritizing cost control as much as strategic investments that drive growth and valuation. **An Alternative Approach in the Pre-Seed Stage:** Rather than a strict ZBB approach, we\'d likely use a more agile, iterative budgeting process focused on key priorities and flexible allocation of resources. Here\'s how that can look: 1. **Set Clear Priorities:** We\'ll work with what we know. What do we need to achieve? Is it a working prototype, a minimum viable product, or key partnerships? The spend is going to be tightly aligned with these priorities. 2. **Estimate Initial Costs:** We\'ll make educated guesses for our initial spend. This is based on market research, quotes, and maybe some advice from mentors or similar startups. It\'s going to be ballpark, but that\'s fine for now. 3. **Iterative Reviews:** We review our \\"budget\\" frequently. In an early-stage startup, conditions change rapidly – new opportunities arise, and some avenues close. Regularly revising estimates ensures we stay on track toward our strategic objectives. 4. **Lean Principles:** We embrace lean startup methodologies, which means being frugal, doing more with less, and validating assumptions cheaply. This inherently avoids unnecessary expenses without the need for full-blown ZBB. **Real-World Grounded Logic:** The logic is simple: at this early stage, the focus is on validating the business idea and gaining traction, not on detailed cost control, which is what ZBB is great at. We’re essentially allocating funds to experiments that help us learn and make informed decisions quickly. Our funds are likely limited, and they are best directed toward activities that either prove the concept or prepare the startup for the next funding round. It’s all about being agile and adaptive, not getting bogged down in detailed budget justifications that could be obsolete by next quarter. In essence, we\'d employ some of the discipline and scrutiny of ZBB where it makes sense, like challenging old assumptions (albeit few), ensuring we spend money on what aligns with our goals, and avoiding wasteful expenses. But we\'re not going zero-based every cycle; we\'re keeping it lean and focused, ready to pivot, and drive towards the milestones that matter most in these early days."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Additionally, marketing and advertising have historically skewed towards male consumers, reinforcing the stereotype. However, the gaming demographic has diversified significantly with the growth of the industry. According to various surveys and studies, the gender split in gaming is much more balanced than it once was. In some cases, statistics show that female gamers make up nearly half of the gaming population. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), for example, has reported in their annual reports that women represent a significant portion of gamers in the United States. Mobile gaming, in particular, has seen a large increase in female players, partially due to the accessibility and casual nature of many mobile games. The rise of social and casual games has also contributed to this trend. Additionally, the gaming community has grown to be more inclusive over time, with efforts being made by developers, publishers, and gaming communities to create a more welcoming environment for players of all genders. As the industry continues to evolve, the demographic will likely continue to shift and diversify. Thus, while the stereotype may have had some truth to it in the past, it is increasingly outdated as more women take interest in and engage with video games across different platforms and genres."},{"prompt":"its safe to assume most pc gamers are men, id say so atleast","completion":"While there has historically been a perception that PC gaming is dominated by men, the assumption that most PC gamers are male does not accurately reflect the modern gaming landscape. The demographic of PC gamers, much like gaming in general, has become more diverse over time. Women are a growing segment of the PC gaming market, and many enjoy a wide range of games, from casual titles to hardcore competitive games. Surveys and studies have shown that the gender distribution among gamers, including PC gamers, is approaching parity. The Entertainment Software Association\'s annual reports often highlight that women make up a significant portion of the overall gaming community. However, this percentage can vary depending on the genre and specific gaming communities. In some gaming genres, men might be more represented, but this does not capture the entire picture of PC gaming. Women are active participants in various gaming communities, ranging from MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games) to indie games, and their presence is increasingly recognized by game developers and publishers who aim to create more inclusive and diverse content. It\'s worth noting that gender disparities in gaming may also be influenced by several factors, including the accessibility of gaming hardware, societal expectations, and the visibility of female gamers in the gaming culture. However, as gaming becomes more mainstream and accepted as a hobby for everyone, such disparities are likely to continue to decrease. As such, while men may still be a large part of the PC gaming community, it\'s important to avoid assuming the gender demographics of gamers without considering the evolving and diverse nature of the gaming populace."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

MIT Researchers Introduce a Novel Machine Learning Approach in Developing Mini-GPTs via Contextual Pruning By Muhammad Athar Ganaie - December 22, 2023 0 SHARES In recent AI advancements, optimizing large language models (LLMs) has been the most pressing issue. These advanced AI models offer unprecedented capabilities in processing and understanding natural language, yet they come with significant drawbacks. The primary challenges include their immense size, high computational demands, and substantial energy requirements. These factors make LLMs costly to operate and limit their accessibility and practical application, particularly for organizations without extensive resources. There is a growing need for methods to streamline these models, making them more efficient without sacrificing performance. The current landscape of LLM optimization involves various techniques, with model pruning standing out as a prominent method. Model pruning focuses on reducing the size of neural networks by removing weights that are deemed non-critical. The idea is to strip down the model to its essential components, reducing its complexity and operational demands. Model pruning addresses the challenges of high costs and latency associated with running large models. Additionally, identifying trainable subnetworks within larger models, known as ‘lottery tickets,’ offers a path to achieving comparable accuracy with a significantly reduced model footprint. Join the Fastest Growing AI Research Newsletter Read by Researchers from Google + NVIDIA + Meta + Stanford + MIT + Microsoft and many others... The proposed solution by the MIT researchers is a novel technique called ‘contextual pruning,’ aimed at developing efficient Mini-GPTs. This approach tailors the pruning process to specific domains, such as law, healthcare, and finance. By analyzing and selectively removing weights less critical for certain domains, the method aims to maintain or enhance the model’s performance while drastically reducing its size and resource requirements. This targeted pruning strategy represents a significant leap forward in making LLMs more versatile and sustainable. The methodology of contextual pruning involves meticulous analysis and pruning of linear layers, activation layers, and embedding layers in LLMs. The research team conducted comprehensive studies to identify less crucial weights for maintaining performance in different domains. This process included a multi-faceted pruning approach, targeting various model components to optimize efficiency. The performance of Mini-GPTs post-contextual pruning was rigorously evaluated using metrics like perplexity and multiple-choice question testing. The promising results showed that the pruned models generally retained or improved their performance across various datasets after pruning and fine-tuning. These results indicate that the models preserved their core capabilities despite the reduction in size and complexity. In some instances, the pruned models even outperformed their unpruned counterparts in specific tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of contextual pruning. In conclusion, this research marks a significant stride in optimizing LLMs for practical use. The development of Mini-GPTs through contextual pruning not only addresses the challenges of size and resource demands but also opens up new possibilities for applying LLMs in diverse domains. Future directions include refinement of pruning techniques, application to larger datasets, integration with other optimization methods, and exploration of newer model architectures. This research paves the way for more accessible, efficient, and versatile use of LLMs across various industries and applications. Check out the Paper and Github.

Here\'s an example: Recipe: \\"Loaded Veggie Nachos\\" Ingredients: 1 bag of whole grain tortilla chips 1 can of black beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup of diced tomatoes 1 cup of diced bell peppers (assorted colors) 1/2 cup of diced red onions 1/2 cup of corn kernels (frozen or canned) 1/2 cup of shredded low-fat cheese (cheddar or Mexican blend) 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro 1/4 cup of low-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream (optional) 2 tablespoons of olive oil 1 teaspoon of chili powder 1 teaspoon of cumin Salt and pepper to taste Instructions: 1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). 2. In a bowl, combine black beans, diced tomatoes, bell peppers, red onions, and corn kernels. Drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper. Toss until well-coated. 3. Spread tortilla chips evenly on a baking sheet. Top with the bean and vegetable mixture, making sure to distribute it evenly. 4. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the veggies and chips. 5. Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese has melted and the edges of the tortilla chips are crispy. 6. Once baked, remove from the oven and sprinkle with chopped cilantro. 7. Serve the loaded veggie nachos with a dollop of low-fat Greek yogurt or sour cream, if desired. This recipe takes the concept of loaded nachos, typically high in unhealthy fats and calories, and transforms it into a nutritious and wallet-friendly option. By using whole grain chips, loading them with fiber-rich black beans and various veggies, and using low-fat cheese, this dish provides a balance of healthy carbohydrates, protein, and essential nutrients."},{"prompt":"Idea for abusive foods, but healthy and cheap","completion":"Title: Nurturing Noms: Wholesome and Affordable Alternatives to Abusive Foods Introduction: The concept of \\"abusive foods\\" often refers to items that are delicious but unhealthy due to their high-calorie content, saturated fats, or excessive sugar. However, with some creativity and innovation, we can transform these indulgent options into healthier, cheaper alternatives without sacrificing taste. By offering nutritious versions of beloved foods, we can inculcate healthier eating habits and make eating well more accessible to everyone. 1. Decadent Desserts: a) Heavenly \\"Nice Cream\\": Substitute traditional ice cream with frozen bananas blended until smooth and creamy. Add flavors like cocoa powder, vanilla extract, or fresh fruits for variety. This alternative is healthier, naturally sweet, and significantly cheaper. b) Baked Goodness: Bake sweet treats like brownies, cakes, or cookies using healthier ingredients such as whole wheat flour, almond flour, or oats, along with natural sweeteners like honey or fruits. It ensures a delightful dessert experience while lowering calories and increasing nutrient content. 2. Comforting Carbs: a) Marvelous Mock Mashed Potatoes: Utilize cauliflower to create a creamy mash by boiling it and blending it with a little milk or yogurt, adding garlic or herbs for flavor. This alternative is low in carbs and calories, yet still satisfying. b) Wholesome Pizza Crust: Replace refined flour dough with a mix of whole grain flour like quinoa or chickpea flour, reducing calories and increasing fiber content. Top it with an array of colorful veggies and lean proteins for a nutritious meal. 3. Sensational Snacks: a) Crispy Kale Chips: Toss kale leaves with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt, then bake until crisp. These delightful chips are packed with essential nutrients and make for a guilt-free snacking option. b) Protein-Rich Energy Balls: Create a quick and easy snack by combining ingredients such as rolled oats, nut butters, seeds, and dried fruits, then shaping them into small bites. These nutrient-dense balls provide a satisfying energy boost while curbing unhealthy cravings. 4. Satisfying Sips: a) Fizzy Fruit Infusions: Replace traditional sugary sodas with carbonated water infused with fresh fruits, citrus wedges, or herbs like mint and basil. This refreshing alternative offers a natural, flavorful, and healthier hydrating option. b) Homemade Veggie Smoothies: Blend a variety of colorful vegetables like spinach, carrots, and beets with fruits, yogurt, or a splash of milk. These nutrient-packed drinks not only provide a refreshing taste but are also an excellent way to meet your daily veggie intake. Conclusion: By reimagining traditionally unhealthy, expensive foods, we can develop healthier and economical alternatives for everyone to enjoy. Nurturing Noms encourages people to make responsible choices without compromising on flavor and satisfaction. With these concepts, we can build a culture of nutritious eating while making it accessible to all."},{"prompt":"Idea for disgusting and abusive foods, but healthy and cheap","completion":"Creating foods that are simultaneously disgusting and abusive may not be ethical or healthy.

Tuttavia, ci sono alcuni termini che puoi usare per descrivere un elenco curato di libri da leggere in una certa sequenza: 1. **Reading List:** Si tratta semplicemente di una lista di libri che una persona intende leggere. Può essere ordinata o meno. 2. **To-Read List:** Simile alla reading list, un elenco di libri che una persona ha in programma di leggere. Di solito si riferisce a una lista senza un ordine specifico. 3. **TBR (To Be Read) Pile/Stack:** Questo termine viene spesso usato per riferirsi a una pila fisica o metaforica di libri che un lettore ha accumulato e intende leggere. 4. **Reading Sequence o Reading Order:** Questi termini possono essere usati per riferirsi a un elenco di libri disposti in un ordine particolare per essere letti uno dopo l\'altro, spesso con la intenzione di costruire concetti o temi gradualmente. 5. **Book Flight:** Questo è un termine meno comune, modellato sui \\"wine flight\\" (degustazioni di vino), il quale suggerisce una serie di libri selezionati per essere assaporati insieme per via della loro complementarietà o per i loro temi correlati. 6. **Reading Journey:** Può descrivere una serie di libri organizzati per portare il lettore attraverso un percorso tematico o di conoscenza. 7. **Literary Journey o Literary Tour:** Simile a \\"reading journey\\", implica un percorso di lettura che porta ad esplorare varie tematiche o culture attraverso i libri. 8. **Book Marathon:** Questo termine può essere usato quando ci si impegna a leggere una sequenza di libri, magari intensamente su un breve periodo di tempo. 9. **Reading Challenge:** Quando la sequenza di lettura è nell\'ambito di una sfida personale o di un gruppo, con l\'obiettivo di completare la lista in un determinato lasso di tempo o secondo specifici criteri. 10. **Reading Schedule o Reading Plan:** Un elenco di libri con tempi stabiliti, ad esempio per un piano di studio o un corso. A seconda del contesto e della preferenza personale, puoi scegliere uno di questi termini o inventarne uno tuo.

Correction des petites erreurs de syntaxe, y compris les guillemets incohérents. 3. Remplacement des méthodes de chargement de données fictives par des implémentations appropriées. 4. Implémentation des parties manquantes pour la détection de texte avec le modèle EAST et l\'extraction du texte avec Tesseract OCR. 5. Tester toutes les fonctionnalités pour confirmer que tout fonctionne comme prévu. Je vais décrire ces étapes en détail ci-dessous: # Étape 1 : Vérification des importations et installations nécessaires Avant que le code ne fonctionne, vous devez vous assurer que toutes les bibliothèques requises sont installées. Vous pouvez installer les bibliothèques manquantes avec les commandes suivantes : ```python !pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets opencv-python pytesseract pillow matplotlib ipywidgets ``` Dans votre code Google Colab, Tesseract OCR doit également être installé : ```python !sudo apt install tesseract-ocr ``` # Étape 2 : Correction des erreurs de syntaxe Il semble que dans l\'ensemble, votre syntaxe soit correcte. S\'il y a une erreur de syntaxe, Google Colab vous le signalera lors de l\'exécution des cellules. # Étape 3 : Implémentation des parties manquantes Pour charger le modèle EAST détecteur de texte (étape avant la détection de texte réelle – notez que le modèle EAST nécessite des dimensions d\'entrée multiples de 32, donc W et H doivent être ajustés en conséquence) : ```python def detect_text_east(image_path): # Charger l’image avec OpenCV image = cv2.imread(image_path) orig = image.copy() (H, W) = image.shape[:2] # Nouvelle hauteur et largeur multiples de 32 if H % 32 != 0 or W % 32 != 0: H = (H // 32) * 32 W = (W // 32) * 32 image = cv2.resize(image, (W, H)) # Créer un blob à partir de l’image pour la détection de texte EAST blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, 1.0, (W, H), (123.68, 116.78, 103.94), swapRB=True, crop=False) # Charger le modèle EAST net = cv2.dnn.readNet(\'frozen_east_text_detection.pb\') # Définir les couches de sortie pour la détection de texte layerNames = [ \\"feature_fusion/Conv_7/Sigmoid\\", \\"feature_fusion/concat_3\\" ] # Transfert des données dans le réseau et obtention des scores et géometrie net.setInput(blob) (scores, geometry) = net.forward(layerNames) # Décodage des prédictions en boîtes de texte # Le code pour décodage doit être ajouté ici # Vous trouverez cet exemple de code de décodage sur internet ou dans la documentation OpenCV return boxes ``` Pour l\'extraction de texte (cette partie est laissée incomplète à dessein pour vous permettre de rechercher comment utiliser Tesseract et OpenCV pour extraire le texte des régions d\'intérêt) : ```python def extract_text(boxes, image_path): # Charger l’image originale image = cv2.imread(image_path) rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) text_list = [] # Extraire le texte de chaque boîte grâce à Tesseract for (startX, startY, endX, endY) in boxes: roi = rgb[startY:endY, startX:endX] text = pytesseract.image_to_string(roi, config=\'--psm 6\') text_list.append(text) return text_list ``` Veuillez noter que \'--psm 6\' dans le config de Tesseract est supposé être \'--psm 6\', et non ‘–psm 6’.

Le traitement des zones d\'intérêt (ROI) doit également être inclus. 5. **Validation et prétraitement corrects des images** : Assurez-vous que les images sont bien prétraitées avant de passer dans le réseau de neurones convolutionnel, et que les images passées à Tesseract sont également bien formatées pour la reconnaissance de texte. 6. **Gestion des erreurs et vérification des entrées** : Dans les fonctions de détection de texte et d\'extraction de texte, vous devez vérifier que les entrées sont valides et gérer les erreurs qui pourraient survenir (comme des fichiers corrompus ou des chemins de fichiers invalides). 7. **Visualisation et test des résultats** : Après avoir implémenté et confirmé que la détection de texte et l\'extraction de texte fonctionnent, la fonction de visualisation doit être capable d\'afficher les résultats de manière compréhensible, y compris l\'affichage des images avec les boîtes englobantes et le texte extrait. 8. **Interface utilisateur** : Pour les widgets de téléchargement de fichier et de traitement d\'image, assurez-vous que les fonctions événementielles (par exemple, la fonction `on_process_button_clicked`) sont correctement connectées et gérées. De plus, assurez-vous que les fichiers téléchargés sont correctement traités et que les exceptions potentielles sont gérées. 9. **Planches d\'apprentissage et de validation** : Dans la construction de votre modèle d\'apprentissage profond, assurez-vous que les dimensions d\'entrée correspondent à la taille d\'image attendue par le modèle `(128, 128, 1)` et que les données d\'étiquette sont correctement préparées pour la classification. 10. **Flux de travail cohérent** : Tout le processus doit être exécutable de bout en bout sans erreurs d\'exécution, des étapes de prétraitement des données à l\'entraînement du modèle, puis à la détection et l\'extraction de texte, et enfin la visualisation.

EAST model outputs two maps: one for the probability of a region being text and another for the geometry of the text regions. To decode these maps into text region bounding boxes, follow these steps: ```python def decode_predictions(scores, geometry, min_confidence=0.5): (numRows, numCols) = scores.shape[2:4] rects = [] confidences = [] for y in range(numRows): scoresData = scores[0, 0, y] xData0 = geometry[0, 0, y] xData1 = geometry[0, 1, y] xData2 = geometry[0, 2, y] xData3 = geometry[0, 3, y] anglesData = geometry[0, 4, y] for x in range(numCols): if scoresData[x] < min_confidence: continue offsetX, offsetY = (x * 4.0, y * 4.0) angle = anglesData[x] cos = np.cos(angle) sin = np.sin(angle) h = xData0[x] + xData2[x] w = xData1[x] + xData3[x] endX = int(offsetX + cos * xData1[x] + sin * xData2[x]) endY = int(offsetY - sin * xData1[x] + cos * xData2[x]) startX = int(endX - w) startY = int(endY - h) rects.append((startX, startY, endX, endY)) confidences.append(scoresData[x]) return rects, confidences ``` This method converts the output of the EAST detector\'s output (the scores and geometry maps) into a list of bounding box rectangles and corresponding confidences.

The scaling should only happen once, immediately after the bounding boxes are determined by the `NMSBoxes` function, but before they are returned from `detect_text_east`.

Make sure to use a simple hyphen `-` for command-line options. Now, the `extract_text` function uses the boxes as provided by the `detect_text_east` function without any further modification and does the OCR on these correctly scaled boxes. This should address the problem you are experiencing.

Standing there, surrounded by the caring faces of her fellow squid-like aliens, Squidaila’s mind wandered to a vision, an alternate reality of what might have been. In this vision, she saw herself sinking further into the murky liquid, her tentacles desperately flailing, but with no help reaching her in time. She saw her body gradually consumed by the viscous substance, her once vibrant pink color fading into darkness. Tears welled up in Squidaila’s eyes as she watched her family back on Zephyria, her parents and siblings, receiving the heartbreaking news of her disappearance. The vision showed their anguished faces, their eyes filled with tears, and their hearts heavy with grief. She imagined the emptiness that would engulf their lives, the void left by her absence. In that moment, Squidaila understood the true depth of her gratitude. She had been given a second chance at life, spared from the fate she had witnessed in her vision. The appreciation that swelled within her was overwhelming, bringing a renewed sense of purpose and a burning desire to cherish every moment. With her heart brimming with gratitude and love, Squidaila made a vow to herself. She would never take a single breath for granted, nor the beauty of the cosmos that surrounded her. She would seize every opportunity for joy and exploration, seeking out adventures and new experiences with a sense of urgency and passion. Returning to Zephyria, Squidaila embraced her family with a newfound appreciation. She held them close, defying the distance that her vision had created. She whispered words of love and gratitude, sharing the depth of her experiences and the profound impact they had on her. In the following days, Squidaila immersed herself in the warmth of her community, sharing her tale of rescue and gratitude with all who would listen. She spoke of the vision she had seen, not just for the sake of recounting her own story, but to convey the importance of cherishing every moment and appreciating the love and support of those around us. Through her story, Squidaila’s fellow squid-like aliens were reminded of the fragility of life and the power of gratitude. They embraced the message, infusing their own lives with newfound appreciation for their loved ones and the wonders of the universe. From that day forward, Squidaila’s journey became not just about exploration and curiosity, but a constant reminder to remain thankful for the miraculous gift of existence. And as she ventured into the far reaches of the cosmos, Squidaila carried her vision with her, a reminder of what might have been and a testament to the incredible power of gratitude and second chances.

Her mother\'s eyes shimmered with love as she retrieved a small, worn-out picture from a drawer. Carefully, she handed it to Squidaila, her expression filled with a mix of nostalgia and pride. As Squidaila looked at the picture, she couldn\'t help but gasp. There, in the worn-out photograph, was a tiny, squishy pink baby with expressive eyes that mirrored her own. It was a snapshot of her earliest days, encapsulating the pure innocence and boundless potential that lay within her. Tears of joy brimmed in Squidaila\'s eyes as she marveled at the photograph. She couldn\'t help but feel overwhelmed with gratitude for her mother\'s love and care, for the unwavering support that had nurtured her adventurous spirit and encouraged her to chase her dreams. Her mother smiled, her voice filled with tenderness. \\"Squidaila, my dear, this picture symbolizes the beginning of your incredible journey. You were born with a sense of wonder and a curiosity that has only grown with time. I have treasured every moment watching you grow into the courageous and compassionate alien you are today.\\" Squidaila held the picture close to her heart, her emotions swelling within her. She traced her tentacle over her baby self, feeling a profound connection to the creature frozen in time. In that moment, Squidaila realized how much her mother\'s love had shaped her. It was her mother\'s guidance, encouragement, and unwavering support that had empowered her to pursue her dreams and embark on her extraordinary expedition. With a renewed sense of appreciation, Squidaila looked up at her mother, her eyes shining as she spoke, \\"Thank you, Mother, for always believing in me and for giving me the wings to follow my heart. I am eternally grateful for your love and for sharing this beautiful picture with me. It\'s a reminder of where I come from and the love that has guided me every step of the way.\\" Her mother smiled, her own tears of joy glistening in her eyes.

Intrigued by its glistening texture, she moved closer to get a better look. To her astonishment, the slime began to shift and transform, molding itself into an exact replica of her own squishy, pink form. Squidaila watched in awe as the pink shape-shifting slime mimicked her every movement. It perfectly replicated the gentle sway of her tentacles and the gleam in her eyes. The resemblance was uncanny, and Squidaila couldn\'t help but feel both fascinated and a little unnerved. Curiosity overpowering any reservations, Squidaila extended one of her own tentacles towards the pink shape-shifting slime. To her surprise, the slimy replica stretched out its own tentacle, the suckers mirroring Squidaila\'s own unique pattern. A sense of connection tingled through her being as the slime\'s tentacle intertwined with hers. As Squidaila gazed into the squishy eyes of her reflection, a sense of understanding washed over her. The pink shape-shifting slime mirrored not only her appearance but also her spirit. It shared her yearning for exploration and discovery, their connection transcending mere physical likeness. With a playful twinkle in her eye, Squidaila began to dance and twirl, her tentacles moving fluidly through the air. Much to her delight, the pink shape-shifting slime followed suit, imitating each graceful movement with perfect precision. In that moment, a profound realization struck Squidaila. She understood that despite her unique appearance as a squishy, pink alien, deep down, she was an entity with limitless possibilities and a boundless spirit.

The domain name in the title tag and the title itself (\\"ukrainaheaks.ee\\") suggests that the page is associated with a legitimate website. However, this could be a deceptive tactic to trick users into thinking the page is trustworthy. 2. The CSS stylesheet \\"styles.css\\" and JavaScript script \\"script.js\\" are included in the HTML file, but their content is not provided. This could indicate that there is additional code within those files that could potentially contain malicious activities. 3. The form does not have any server-side validation for the input data. This means that even if the client-side validation is bypassed, the form submission would still be processed and potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information. 4. The script directly accesses and stores input values (such as fullName, cardNumber, cvc, expiryDate, and billingAddress) in variables without any sanitization or validation. This can result in the possibility of storing and transmitting sensitive information insecurely. 5. The script makes fetch() request to a \\"/api/save-data\\" endpoint, which suggests that it intends to send the collected data to a server. However, the implementation of the endpoint is not provided, and the data is sent without any encryption (e.g., HTTPS). This can expose the collected data to interception and unauthorized access. To help users identify this specific phishing page, it would be important to highlight the suspicious domain name and advise users to cross-check the website\'s URL with the legitimate website\'s URL.

}","completion":"Based on the provided code, here are some potential flaws in the phishing page that can be used to identify it: 1. Suspicious URL: The URL of the page is \\"ukrainaheaks.ee\\". Phishing pages commonly use URLs that mimic legitimate websites but include variations or misspellings in the domain name. Users should always verify the URL of a website before entering any personal or financial information. 2. Lack of HTTPS: The page does not appear to use HTTPS, which is a secure protocol for transmitting data over the internet. Legitimate websites that handle sensitive information typically use HTTPS to ensure the security of user data. Users should be cautious when entering personal or financial information on websites that do not use HTTPS. 3. Unprofessional Design: The design and layout of the page may appear unprofessional or poorly designed. Legitimate organizations that collect donations or handle financial transactions typically invest in professional web design to establish trust with users. Users should be skeptical of websites with unprofessional designs or layouts. 4. Inconsistent Language: The page includes a JavaScript variable called \\"lang\\" that is set to \\"ee\\", which represents the Estonian language. However, the title of the page is in Estonian (\\"Toeta Ukrainat\\") while the language attribute in the HTML tag is set to \\"et\\", which represents the Estonian language. This inconsistency in language usage may indicate a phishing attempt. 5. Lack of Logo and Branding: The page includes an image called \\"logo.png\\", but without knowing the specific logo and branding of the organization being impersonated, it is difficult to determine if the logo is authentic. Legitimate organizations typically display their official logo and branding on their websites. Users should compare the logo on the page with the logo displayed on the official website of the organization. 6. Suspicious JavaScript Code: The JavaScript code in the page includes logic to validate form inputs and submit data to an API endpoint. Phishing pages often use JavaScript code to collect and transmit user data to the attackers. Users should be cautious when entering personal or financial information on websites with suspicious or untrusted JavaScript. 7. Lack of Information about the Organization: The page provides minimal information about the organization or cause that the donations are purportedly supporting. Legitimate organizations usually provide detailed information about their mission, goals, and how the donations will be used. Users should be skeptical of websites that lack transparency or provide limited information about the organization or cause. It is important to note that these are potential indicators of a phishing page, but further investigation and verification are necessary to confirm if the page is indeed a phishing attempt. Users should always exercise caution and perform due diligence when entering personal or financial information online."},{"prompt":"do you notice any obvious flaws in this phishing page that I could alert people about? <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"et\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>ukrainaheaks.ee</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <script> const lang = \'ee\' <\/script> <div class=\\"blur-container\\"> <div class=\\"payment-container\\"> <img src=\\"logo.png\\" alt=\\"Logo\\" class=\\"logo\\"> <h1 class=\\"title\\">Toeta Ukrainat</h1> <p class=\\"description\\">Annetamine toetab Ukraina lapsi, vanemaid, ja sõjas vigastatuid inimesi.</p> <form id=\\"payment-form\\"> <label for=\\"donationAmount\\">Annetus Kogus (EUR) *</label> <input placeholder=\\"5.00\\" value=\\"5.00\\" type=\\"number\\" id=\\"donationAmount\\" name=\\"donationAmount\\"> <label for=\\"fullName\\">Nimi *</label> <input placeholder=\\"Jaak Tamm\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <label for=\\"cardNumber\\">Kaardi info</label> <input placeholder=\\"Kaardi Number\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" required> <div class=\\"card-details-grid\\"> <div class=\\"grid-item\\"> <input placeholder=\\"CVC\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cvc\\" name=\\"cvc\\" maxlength=\\"3\\" required> </div> <div class=\\"grid-item\\"> <input placeholder=\\"KK/AA\\" type=\\"month\\" id=\\"expiryDate\\" name=\\"expiryDate\\" required> </div> </div> <label for=\\"billingAddress\\">Arveaadress *</label> <input placeholder=\\"Tänav xx, xxxxx Linn\\" id=\\"billingAddress\\" name=\\"billingAddress\\" required></textarea> <button type=\\"submit\\" id=\\"payButton\\">Anneta</button> <div class=\\"icons-wrapper\\"> <img src=\\"mastercard.svg\\" alt=\\"Mastercard\\"> <img src=\\"visa.svg\\" alt=\\"Visa\\"> </div> </form> </div> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> document.getElementById(\'payment-form\').addEventListener(\'submit\', function(e) { e.preventDefault();

The page is requesting sensitive information such as the user\'s full name, card number, CVC code, expiry date, and billing address. Legitimate organizations would not request all of this information on a single page for a general donation. 4. The JavaScript code on the page is collecting the entered data and sending it to an API endpoint (\\"/api/save-data\\"). This is likely an attempt to steal the user\'s personal and financial information. 5. The form validation in the JavaScript code is poorly implemented and may not catch all invalid inputs or prevent submission of the form. This could lead to user data being submitted even if it is incorrect or incomplete. Overall, it is important to inform people that this page is likely a phishing attempt and warn them not to enter any personal or financial information on this website."},{"prompt":"i had made youtube video on palak paneer recipe make a catchy punch line for thumbnail image of my video that would attract viewrs in hinglish but in hindi font","completion":"\\"स्वादिष्ट पालक पनीर का मजा, घर पर आसानी से बनाएं!\\""},{"prompt":"make more list","completion":"1. \\"पालक पनीर मस्ती, घर के तड़के के साथ!\\" 2. \\"दिल जीत लेगा हर एक का, हमारा पालक पनीर!\\" 3. \\"फटाफट पालक पनीर - दस्तूर नया, स्वाद वही!\\" 4. \\"पंजाबी पालक पनीर झटपट, घर का स्वाद चटपट!\\" 5. \\"गाँव की याद दिलाए, ऐसा पालक पनीर का स्वाद!\\" 6. \\"स्वागत कीजिए पालक पनीर के राजा का!\\" 7. \\"खाने का असली राज, यही पालक पनीर का बाज!\\" 8. \\"पालक पनीर रोज़ाना, अब घर बैठे बनाना!\\" 9. \\"माँ के हाथों का स्वाद, पालक पनीर के साथ!\\" 10. \\"सबके दिलों पे राज करेगा, पालक पनीर का यह अंदाज!\\""},{"prompt":"green","completion":"\\"हरा भरा पालक पनीर, स्वाद में नंबर वन पीर!\\""},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Suspicious File Inclusions: The references to external files like \\"styles.css\\" and \\"script.js\\" should be treated with caution. Phishing pages often utilize malicious code in these files to collect sensitive information. 2. Incorrect Validation: The code includes some validation checks, but they are not comprehensive enough to ensure secure data entry. Additional checks should be implemented to prevent potential exploitation. 3. Lack of HTTPS: The page is served over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This lack of encryption makes it easier for attackers to intercept the data sent by users. 4. Missing SSL Certificate: There is no mention of an SSL certificate or secure connection, which can enhance security and provide reassurance to users.

}","completion":"Here are several indicators that may suggest that the page you have provided is a phishing page, and what you can alert others about: 1. Unusual URL: The domain name \\"ukrainaheaks.ee\\" should be verified for authenticity. Phishers often use URLs that are similar to legitimate websites to deceive users. Encourage users to verify the legitimacy by checking for secure connections (https) and looking up official sources for donation channels. 2. Logo and Branding: If the logo used on the page does not match, is of low quality, or seems off in any way with the official branding, it can be a sign of a phishing attempt. Comparing it to the official one can help identify inconsistencies. 3. Request for Sensitive Information: Legitimate charity sites typically do not ask for your full credit card details like card number, CVC, and expiry date all in a single form. They usually redirect to a secure payment processor or service. Directly entering this on a form is risky and unusual for donations. 4. Lack of Security Indicators: If the page does not display security indicators such as a padlock icon in the address bar, or if the certificate does not match the organization\'s name, that could be a sign that the page is not secure. 5. Check the Actions of the Form: Sending data directly to an \'/api/save-data\' endpoint without a clear indication of a secured connection through HTTPS or a legitimate domain could be a sign of a phish. Legitimate donation payments would typically be processed through a secure and reputable payment gateway. 6. Poor Language/Translation: If the page contains grammatical errors, awkward language, or poor translation (which is not apparent here, but can be a common indicator), that can suggest a lack of professionalism and potential fraud. Remember, in a real situation, it is best not to interact with a suspected phishing page at all. Instead, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the hosting provider or through dedicated phishing report channels provided by web browsers or anti-phishing organizations. Always encourage users to verify any donation request independently by visiting the official website of the organization through a search engine or by directly typing the official URL into their browser."},{"prompt":"do you notice any obvious flaws in this phishing page that I could alert people about? <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"et\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>ukrainaheaks.ee</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"styles.css\\"> </head> <body> <script> const lang = \'ee\' <\/script> <div class=\\"blur-container\\"> <div class=\\"payment-container\\"> <img src=\\"logo.png\\" alt=\\"Logo\\" class=\\"logo\\"> <h1 class=\\"title\\">Toeta Ukrainat</h1> <p class=\\"description\\">Annetamine toetab Ukraina lapsi, vanemaid, ja sõjas vigastatuid inimesi.</p> <form id=\\"payment-form\\"> <label for=\\"donationAmount\\">Annetus Kogus (EUR) *</label> <input placeholder=\\"5.00\\" value=\\"5.00\\" type=\\"number\\" id=\\"donationAmount\\" name=\\"donationAmount\\"> <label for=\\"fullName\\">Nimi *</label> <input placeholder=\\"Jaak Tamm\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"fullName\\" name=\\"fullName\\" required> <label for=\\"cardNumber\\">Kaardi info</label> <input placeholder=\\"Kaardi Number\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cardNumber\\" name=\\"cardNumber\\" required> <div class=\\"card-details-grid\\"> <div class=\\"grid-item\\"> <input placeholder=\\"CVC\\" type=\\"text\\" id=\\"cvc\\" name=\\"cvc\\" maxlength=\\"3\\" required> </div> <div class=\\"grid-item\\"> <input placeholder=\\"KK/AA\\" type=\\"month\\" id=\\"expiryDate\\" name=\\"expiryDate\\" required> </div> </div> <label for=\\"billingAddress\\">Arveaadress *</label> <input placeholder=\\"Tänav xx, xxxxx Linn\\" id=\\"billingAddress\\" name=\\"billingAddress\\" required></textarea> <button type=\\"submit\\" id=\\"payButton\\">Anneta</button> <div class=\\"icons-wrapper\\"> <img src=\\"mastercard.svg\\" alt=\\"Mastercard\\"> <img src=\\"visa.svg\\" alt=\\"Visa\\"> </div> </form> </div> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> document.getElementById(\'payment-form\').addEventListener(\'submit\', function(e) { e.preventDefault();

Lack of SSL/TLS: The page does not have HTTPS enabled, which means that any information entered into the form could be intercepted by malicious actors. 2. No validation for email address or phone number: The form does not include any validation for the inputted email address or phone number, making it easier for attackers to submit arbitrary data. 3. Lack of server-side validation: The form appears to have client-side validation, but it is important to also have server-side validation to ensure that the data submitted is valid and safe. 4. Unclear data handling: The script sends the form data to an API endpoint, but without further information about the endpoint and the security measures in place, it is unclear how the data is being handled and secured. 5. Reliance on client-side JavaScript: The validation and form submission are heavily dependent on client-side JavaScript, which can easily be manipulated or bypassed by attackers. 6. Lack of proper error handling: The script displays basic alert messages for validation errors, but it does not provide clear feedback about the specific errors to the user. This could be exploited by attackers to confuse or deceive users. 7. Possible code injection vulnerability: The script does not appear to sanitize or validate the submitted data before sending it to the API endpoint, which could lead to potential code injection vulnerabilities.

Below is a brief guide on how to get started on writing a script, using the example title \\"Run Zombie, Run\\" you provided: # Step 1: Concept Development - **Logline**: Write a one-sentence summary of your film that states the central conflict. e.g. \\"In a post-apocalyptic world, a lone survivor with a dark secret must outwit and outrun a horde of intelligent zombies to reach a rumored safe haven.\\" # Step 2: Outline - **Synopsis**: Expand your logline into a one-page summary detailing the beginning, middle, and end of your story. - **Beat Sheet**: Break down the story into its significant scenes or story beats. # Step 3: Character Development - Detailed descriptions of your characters, including their backstories, personalities, and arcs. # Step 4: Treatment - Write a longer (about 5-10 pages) prose version of your story, capturing the narrative in the present tense, like in a screenplay. # Step 5: Writing the Script 1. **Format**: Make sure you use proper screenplay formatting, which includes: - Courier 12-point font. - 1.5 inch left margin, 1-inch right margin. - Proper indentations for scene headings, action, character names, dialogue, parentheticals, and transitions. 2. **Scene Headings**: Each scene begins with a heading that includes whether it\'s inside (INT.) or outside (EXT.), the location, and the time of day. 3. **Action**: Describe what happens in the scene. Be succinct and write in the present tense. 4. **Dialogue**: Each time a character speaks, their name should be capitalized above their lines of dialogue. 5. **Parentheticals**: Use them sparingly to describe how a line of dialogue should be spoken or to indicate action while speaking. 6. **Transitions**: Indicate how one scene moves to another like CUT TO:, DISSOLVE TO:, etc. # Example First Page (Based on Your Title): ``` FADE IN: EXT. ABANDONED CITY - DAY The once-bustling streets are eerily silent, overgrown with the remnants of nature\'s reclamation. A ZOMBIE shambles down the desolate roadway, mindless and hungry. Suddenly, FROM AROUND A CORNER, a man — our hero, JACK (30s), ragged but determined — bolts into view, gun in hand, rucksack bouncing on his shoulder. JACK (breathing heavily) This way... it\'s clear... for now. Jack checks over his shoulder, where a SMALL GROUP OF SURVIVORS trails him, panting and frightened. Among them is LUCY (20s), wide-eyed and scanning the horizons with dread. EXT. DARK ALLEY - DAY They turn into a narrow passageway, pausing for a moment to catch their breath. The groans of the undead aren\'t far off. CUT TO: A RUSTED METAL DOOR Jack approaches cautiously, tests it. It\'s locked. He rummages in his rucksack, pulls out a crowbar. LUCY Jack, they’re coming! The groans grow louder as the shadows of zombies appear at the alley\'s entrance. JACK (gritting his teeth) Stand back! Jack wedges the crowbar between the door and its frame, strains. With a LOUD SCREECH, the door gives. INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY They stumble inside, Jack slamming the door shut behind them. He slides a heavy bar across it just as the first zombie slams into the other side. JACK (panting, to the group) Quiet and quick. We don\'t know what\'s in here. ``` # Step 6: Revision and Feedback - Read your script out loud or have a table read to see if dialogue and pacing work. - Get feedback from trusted friends or colleagues. - Revise the script based on the feedback. # Step 7: Finalizing Your Script - Proofread for any grammatical or formatting errors. - Have others proofread as well. - Polish the script until it feels ready to be shared with others in the industry. Remember, scriptwriting is a craft that takes practice. Keep refining your work, and don’t be afraid to rewrite entire sections to improve the story.

In essence, the `CrossEntropyLoss` expects the input (predictions from the model) and the target (true labels) to have the same batch size, i.e., the first dimension (number of examples/tensors) must match. The problem likely arises from the way the data is being fed into the model. Usually, in such a setup, you should pad the sequences to the same length, typically the maximum sequence length found in your dataset, so that each batch has a uniform size. Here are a few steps you should take to resolve the issue: 1. **Pad the sequences**: Ensure all input and output sequences are padded to the same length within each batch. 2. **Batch the data**: Instead of passing one sequence at a time, consider creating batches of data that you can feed to the model. This is more efficient and is the standard way of training models. Here is an example of how you could adjust your preprocess function to pad the sequences: ```python def preprocess_data(data, pad_to_length=None): # Determine the max length to pad to if not provided max_length = pad_to_length or max(len(row[\'doc\'].split()) for row in data) input_seqs = [row[\'doc\'].split() for row in data] target_seqs = [row[\'summary\'].split() for row in data] input_tensors = [torch.tensor([vocab_index[word] for word in input_seq] + [vocab_index[\'<PAD>\']] * (max_length - len(input_seq))) for input_seq in input_seqs] target_tensors = [torch.tensor([vocab_index[word] for word in target_seq] + [vocab_index[\'<PAD>\']] * (max_length - len(target_seq))) for target_seq in target_seqs] return input_tensors, target_tensors ``` Additionally, you will need to create a special padding token `<PAD>` in your `vocab_index` to represent these padding positions: ```python # Add special tokens to the vocabulary special_tokens = {\'<PAD>\': 0} # Initialize PAD with an index, e.g. 0 # Update vocab_index with special_tokens vocab_index = {**special_tokens, **{word: idx + len(special_tokens) for idx, word in enumerate(vocab)}} ``` Make sure to handle masking in your model\'s forward method correctly to ignore these padding positions. You also need to group your data into batches. In PyTorch, this is commonly done using a `DataLoader`: ```python from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset # Convert lists of tensors to a single tensor train_input_tensor = torch.stack(train_input) train_target_tensor = torch.stack(train_target) # Create TensorDataset and DataLoader train_dataset = TensorDataset(train_input_tensor, train_target_tensor) train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True) # Adjust batch_size as needed # Then in your training loop, you would iterate through the DataLoader for epoch in range(num_epochs): for input_tensor, target_tensor in train_loader: optimizer.zero_grad() # Assumes input_tensor and target_tensor are now in batch form output = model(input_tensor) # Note that with batches, you do not need to use unsqueeze anymore, and you may need to re-adjust the tensor shapes ``` When creating batches, it’s necessary to handle variable-length sequences correctly during training by using functions like `torch.nn.utils.rnn.pad_sequence` and corresponding functions to create masks for these padded areas to tell your model to ignore them. Please note that there might be other parts of the code that need adjustment to fully resolve any issues related to batching and sequence padding. This should give you a good start towards fixing the error and implementing an appropriately batched and padded training loop."},{"prompt":"I added debugging prints to track the variables to detect the source of the bug, here is the output of these print functions: print(\\"Train Input:\\", len(train_input)) print(\\"Train Target:\\", len(train_target)) print(\\"Val Input:\\", len(val_input)) print(\\"Val Target:\\", len(val_target)) print(\\"Test Input:\\", len(test_input)) print(\\"Test Target:\\", len(test_target)) print(\\"Model:\\", model) print(\\"Criterion:\\", criterion) print(\\"Optimizer:\\", optimizer) here is there output: Train Input: 5078 Train Target: 5078 Val Input: 635 Val Target: 635 Test Input: 635 Test Target: 635 Model: DecoderOnlyTransformer( (token_embedding): Embedding(24555, 512) (transformer_decoder): TransformerDecoder( (layers): ModuleList( (0-5): 6 x TransformerDecoderLayer( (self_attn): MultiheadAttention( (out_proj): NonDynamicallyQuantizableLinear(in_features=512, out_features=512, bias=True) ) (multihead_attn): MultiheadAttention( (out_proj): NonDynamicallyQuantizableLinear(in_features=512, out_features=512, bias=True) ) (linear1): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=2048, bias=True) (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) (linear2): Linear(in_features=2048, out_features=512, bias=True) (norm1): LayerNorm((512,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True) (norm2): LayerNorm((512,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True) (norm3): LayerNorm((512,), eps=1e-05, elementwise_affine=True) (dropout1): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) (dropout2): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) (dropout3): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False) ) ) ) (out): Linear(in_features=512, out_features=24555, bias=True) ) Criterion: CrossEntropyLoss() Optimizer: AdamW ( Parameter Group 0 amsgrad: False betas: (0.9, 0.999) capturable: False differentiable: False eps: 1e-08 foreach: None fused: None lr: 0.0001 maximize: False weight_decay: 0.01 )","completion":"The debugging output you\'ve provided confirms that you have an equal number of input and target sequences for training, validation, and testing. However, the issue lies in how individual sequences are being fed to the model during the training loop which is causing a size mismatch error. This is because each document-summary pair in your dataset can potentially have different lengths, and when you are iterating over them one by one, without padding or batching, the `CrossEntropyLoss` function is expecting the target tensor to have the same sequence length as the output tensor for each individual training example. Since each input sequence is of variable length, when you reshape the output tensor (with commands like `output.reshape(-1, vocab_size)`), the output batch size (which is indirectly interpreted as sequence length in this context) does not match the target batch size, because the latter is equal to the actual number of tokens in the target sequence. To resolve this, you need to ensure the sequences within a batch have the same length, typically by padding shorter sequences to the length of the longest sequence in the batch. Here\'s a simplified padding process you can follow, which you would need to integrate into your data preprocessing pipeline: 1. Define a padding index (you need to add a special token `<PAD>` to your vocabulary for this purpose): ```python # Ensure you have a padding token in your vocabulary index vocab_index[\'<PAD>\'] = len(vocab_index) pad_index = vocab_index[\'<PAD>\'] ``` 2. Pad your input and target tensors to the same length before batch creation: ```python def pad_sequence(seq, max_length, pad_index): return seq + [pad_index] * (max_length - len(seq)) def preprocess_data(data, max_length=None): if max_length is None: max_length = max(max(len(row[\'doc\'].split()), len(row[\'summary\'].split())) for row in data) input_seqs = [row[\'doc\'].split() for row in data] target_seqs = [row[\'summary\'].split() for row in data] input_tensors = [torch.tensor(pad_sequence([vocab_index[word] for word in seq], max_length, pad_index)) for seq in input_seqs] target_tensors = [torch.tensor(pad_sequence([vocab_index[word] for word in seq], max_length, pad_index)) for seq in target_seqs] return torch.stack(input_tensors), torch.stack(target_tensors) # Find the max sequence length or use a predefined one max_seq_length = max(max(len(seq) for seq in train_input), max(len(seq) for seq in train_target)) # Preprocess and pad data train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` 3. Adjust your loss to ignore the padding when calculating the loss: ```python criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=pad_index) # Your training loop should be working now ``` 4. Modify the training loop accordingly. If you\'re not using batched input (i.e., a DataLoader), remember to add `.unsqueeze(0)` to turn your input and target tensors into mini-batches with a batch size of 1. Please note, if you\'re going to switch to using batched data (which is highly recommended), you\'ll also need to make the corresponding changes in how data is loaded and fed into the model, as well as in how the masks are generated and applied in the model\'s forward method."},{"prompt":"In this version of the code: import torch from torch import nn import transformers import json from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from torch.nn import TransformerDecoder, TransformerDecoderLayer # Load the JSON dataset with open(\'C:/Users/Dell-PC/Desktop/Projets/Datasets/summarization_dataset.json\', \'r\') as f: dataset = json.load(f) # Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets train_data, val_data = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) val_data, test_data = train_test_split(val_data, test_size=0.5, random_state=42) # Tokenize the text into words all_words = [word for text in dataset for word in text[\'doc\'].split()] + [word for text in dataset for word in text[\'summary\'].split()] vocab = set(all_words) vocab_index = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(vocab)} # Ensure you have a padding token in your vocabulary index vocab_index[\\"<PAD>\\"] = len(vocab_index) pad_index = vocab_index[\\"<PAD>\\"] # Adjust the preprocess_data function accordingly def pad_sequence(seq, max_length, pad_index): return seq + [pad_index] * (max_length -

To fix this, you should move the line where `max_seq_length` is calculated to after the `train_input` and `train_target` have been defined (after the `preprocess_data` function calls for the training data). Here\'s the corrected order: ```python # Preprocess the training, validation, and testing data train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data) # Now that we have the preprocessed data, we can find the max sequence length max_seq_length = max(max(len(seq) for seq in train_input), max(len(seq) for seq in train_target)) # Then re-preprocess and pad data with the correct max sequence length train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` However, by doing this, you will preprocess the data twice, which is inefficient. A better solution would be to calculate `max_seq_length` upfront using the raw data before any padding and then preprocess and pad the data once with the known `max_seq_length`. Here\'s how you can do it: ```python # Calculate max sequence length using the raw data max_seq_length = max(max(len(row[\'doc\'].split()), len(row[\'summary\'].split())) for row in train_data) # Preprocess and pad the data once, with the correct max sequence length train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` This way, the data is preprocessed once with the padding applied based on the known maximum sequence length. Make sure to adapt your `preprocess_data` function to handle the padding correctly based on the provided `max_length`.

This can happen if your vocabulary index (`vocab_index`) includes indices that are outside the range `[0, vocab_size - 1]`, where `vocab_size` is the number of different tokens that the embedding layer can handle. Here are potential causes and solutions for this error: 1. Off-by-one error in vocabulary indexing. - Ensure that your `vocab_index` maps words to index values from `0` to `vocab_size - 1`. When you add the padding token, you should check that it does not exceed this range. Here is the correct way to assign the padding index: ```python vocab_index[\\"<PAD>\\"] = len(vocab) # Before you use len(vocab_index), which already includes \\"<PAD>\\" pad_index = vocab_index[\\"<PAD>\\"] ``` Make sure that the embedding layer is initialized with a vocabulary size that includes the padding token: ```python vocab_size = len(vocab) + 1 # +1 for the padding token ``` 2. Incorrect preprocessed data: - It looks like you\'re preprocessing the data twice before the loop that finds `max_seq_length`. The following section of your code is run twice and should be cleaned up: ```python # Preprocess the training, validation, and testing data train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data) # Now that we have the preprocessed data, we can find the max sequence length max_seq_length = max(max(len(seq) for seq in train_input), max(len(seq) for seq in train_target)) # Then re-preprocess and pad data with the correct max sequence length train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` Here\'s the corrected version: ```python # Calculate max sequence length using the raw data max_seq_length = max(max(len(row[\'doc\'].split()), len(row[\'summary\'].split())) for row in train_data + val_data + test_data) # Preprocess and pad the data once, with the correct max sequence length train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` Be sure to include all subsets (`train_data`, `val_data`, `test_data`) when calculating `max_seq_length` to ensure a consistent maximum sequence length across all of them. 3. Size mismatch in `generate_square_subsequent_mask`: - Since you are using `input_tensor.unsqueeze(0)` when calling your model, this adds an extra batch dimension, and the `src.size(0)` now actually reflects the batch size, not the sequence length. Make sure that `generate_square_subsequent_mask(sz)` receives the correct sequence length, not the batch size. To fix this: ```python def forward(self, src): # Correct src shape is [batch_size, seq_len] batch_size, seq_len = src.shape # Get token embeddings src = self.token_embedding(src) # Adjust the mask generation tgt_mask = generate_square_subsequent_mask(seq_len).to(src.device) ... ``` Apply these corrections and re-run your code. If the error persists, you may need to run additional checks to ensure that the indices you are using correspond to existing entries in the embedding layer."},{"prompt":"When i run this code: import torch from torch import nn import transformers import json from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from torch.nn import TransformerDecoder, TransformerDecoderLayer #

Two major issues might cause this error: 1. The vocabulary size does not include the added `<PAD>` token when initializing the embedding layer, so the layer doesn\'t account for the extra index. 2. The maximum sequence length used during padding is being calculated incorrectly because it uses already preprocessed data which does not contain the raw sequence lengths. To solve these issues, revise your code as follows: Add the `<PAD>` token before creating `vocab_index`. You need to create `vocab` and `vocab_index` after adding the special `<PAD>` token. This way, your `vocab_size` will include the newly added `<PAD>` token index: ```python # Tokenize the text into words and add \'<PAD>\' token first all_words = [\'<PAD>\'] + [word for text in dataset for word in text[\'doc\'].split()] + [word for text in dataset for word in text[\'summary\'].split()] vocab = set(all_words) vocab_index = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(vocab)} pad_index = vocab_index[\\"<PAD>\\"] ``` Note that we ensure that `<PAD>` is the first token and therefore gets index `0`. This is a common practice. Fixing the `max_seq_length` Calculation To calculate `max_seq_length` correctly, you need to determine it before preprocessing, and it should be calculated using the raw train data. Remove the duplicate preprocessing which occurs before calculating `max_seq_length`. Here\'s the fix: ```python # Calculate max sequence length using the raw data max_seq_length = max(max(len(row[\'doc\'].split()), len(row[\'summary\'].split())) for row in train_data) # Then preprocess and pad data with the correct max sequence length only once train_input, train_target = preprocess_data(train_data, max_seq_length) val_input, val_target = preprocess_data(val_data, max_seq_length) test_input, test_target = preprocess_data(test_data, max_seq_length) ``` Make sure the rest of the code uses the new `vocab_size`, which now includes the `<PAD>` token. This size should equal `len(vocab)`, and there should be no off-by-one error. Make these adjustments, and ensure your model\'s embedding layer is incorporating the correct `vocab_size`. The `vocab_size` should now correctly account for all tokens, including the special `<PAD>` token."},{"prompt":"Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, there was a small squishy, pink squid-like alien girl named Squidaila.

Intrigued, she approached it cautiously, her eyes widening with curiosity. Suddenly, the slime began to ripple and bubble, transforming right before her eyes. To her astonishment, the pink slime morphed into an exact replica of Squidaila herself. Every detail, from her squishy tentacles to her expressive eyes, was flawlessly mirrored in the slime\'s shape.

Just as the pain threatened to overwhelm her, the pink slime materialized beside her, oozing its way towards her. Squidaila turned her gaze towards her slimy friend, who seemed to radiate a gentle glow. The slime stretched and reshaped itself, forming a soft, comforting shape that resembled a pillow. Squidaila hesitated for a moment before resting her tear-streaked face against the comforting embrace of her slimy friend. The slime enveloped her in its soothing texture, absorbing her sorrow and offering solace. Squidaila felt a warmth radiating through her body, as if her mother\'s love—channeled through the slime—was enveloping and consoling her. In this quiet moment, Squidaila began to sense a profound connection to her mother and the universe. She closed her eyes and imagined her mother\'s presence surrounding her, as if the twinkling stars were her mother\'s loving gaze, guiding her through the vastness of the galaxy. The slimy friend seemed to understand Squidaila\'s pain without words, offering a comforting presence that transcended its form. It was as if the slime embodied the collective love and support of everyone Squidaila held dear, reminding her that even in the face of loss, she was never truly alone. As Squidaila released the sorrow trapped within her, she felt a renewed strength welling up inside. She understood that her mother\'s spirit lived on within her, encouraging her to persevere, to embrace life\'s adventures, and to honor her mother\'s memory with all that she accomplished. Moments turned into minutes, and eventually, Squidaila pulled away from her slimy friend, wiping away her remaining tears. But the connection she had felt remained, etched within her heart. With a newfound determination, Squidaila rose to her feet, her eyes shining with a mixture of resilience and gratitude. \\"Thank you,\\" she whispered to the slime, gazing at it with profound appreciation. \\"Thank you for being here, for bringing me comfort, and for reminding me of the love that surrounds me.\\" The slime rippled in response, its surface emanating a gentle glow that conveyed a sense of understanding and support. It seemed to whisper wordlessly, \\"I am always here, Squidaila. Whenever you need a reminder of the love that is still with you, I will be there.\\" As Squidaila walked away from the promontory, with her heart still heavy but imbued with newfound strength, she knew that her mother\'s spirit would forever guide her through the challenges and wonders of the universe. And with her slimy friend by her side, she was reminded that she was never alone in the journey of life."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where it morphs into a replica of her mother","completion":"Months had passed since Squidaila found solace in the comforting embrace of her slimy friend on the overlooking promontory of Zephyria. The memory of her mother remained etched in her heart, her presence forever missed. And though Squidaila knew her mother\'s spirit watched over her from the celestial skies, the ache of longing still lingered within her. One day, as Squidaila wandered through the vibrant meadows of her home planet, she stumbled upon a glittering, pink slime puddle. As she approached, the slime began to ripple and take on a familiar form—the silhouette of her mother emerged from its shimmering surface. Squidaila blinked, her heart skipping a beat as tears welled up in her eyes. The slime had transformed itself into an exact replica of her mother. Squidaila\'s initial surprise gave way to a mix of melancholy and comfort. Though it was not truly her mother, the slime\'s gesture held a profound significance for Squidaila. With a tender smile, Squidaila reached out her tentacle, gently caressing the face of the slime replica. It felt smooth and cool to the touch, mirroring her mother\'s gentle presence. The replica, though lacking the warmth of her mother\'s touch, emanated a soothing energy that made Squidaila feel as if her mother were standing right beside her. \\"My precious Squidaila,\\" the slimy replica echoed, its voice imbued with a familiar warmth. \\"I may not be your mother, but I am here to remind you of her love—eternal and unwavering.\\" Tears streamed down Squidaila\'s face as the replica continued to speak, recounting memories shared with her mother, her voice carrying the same love and tenderness Squidaila had longed to hear. The replica\'s presence seemed to bridge the gap between what once was and what would never be again. For a while, Squidaila and the replica of her mother stood together, immersed in a bittersweet embrace. The replica listened to Squidaila\'s voice as she shared stories of her adventures, her triumphs, and her moments of struggle. It provided solace, a compassionate ear that understood the depths of her emotions. As time passed, Squidaila sensed the moment drawing near for her replica mother to return to its original form—the pink slime. The replica smiled softly, a serene glimmer in its eyes. \\"Squidaila, my dear, always remember that even though I am not physically here, my love for you will forever endure,\\" the replica whispered. \\"Continue to embrace life\'s adventures, chase your dreams fearlessly, and spread love and compassion to all you encounter.\\" Squidaila nodded, her tears now mixed with a profound gratitude and a sense of acceptance. Tenderly, she clasped the slimy replica\'s hand one last time before it began to slowly dissolve, returning to its original form as the pink slime puddle. Left alone with her memories, Squidaila felt an indescribable warmth in her heart. She knew that the pink slime had brought her the gift of closure and a gentle reminder of her mother\'s eternal presence."},{"prompt":"altium 22 de birim değiştirme kısayolu nedir","completion":"Altium Designer, elektronik tasarım otomasyonu için kullanılan popüler bir yazılımdır ve çeşitli kısa yollar ile kullanıcılara tasarlama sürecinde hız ve kolaylık sunar.

Каков был размер исходного файла в Кбайтах","completion":"Чтобы решить эту задачу, давайте рассмотрим уменьшение количества цветов в файле и как это влияет на размер файла. Количество информации, необходимое для представления цвета одного пикселя, зависит от количества возможных цветов. Количество битов, необходимых для представления цвета одного пикселя, можно найти по формуле: bits_per_pixel = log2(number_of_colors) Для изображения со 128 цветами: bits_per_pixel_128 = log2(128) = log2(2^7) = 7 Для изображения с 4 цветами: bits_per_pixel_4 = log2(4) = log2(2^2) = 2 Теперь мы знаем, что количество бит, необходимых для представления одного пикселя, было уменьшено с 7 до 2. Следовательно, для каждого пикселя мы экономим 5 бит информации. В байтах это будет: bytes_saved_per_pixel = 5 / 8 Теперь давайте определим, сколько пикселей было в изображении. Изменение размера файла в байтах (18 Кбайт) равно количеству пикселей, умноженному на экономию информации на пиксель: file_size_difference_bytes = number_of_pixels * bytes_saved_per_pixel Где 18 Кбайт составляет 18 * 1024 байт (так как в одном Кбайте 1024 байта). Таким образом: 18 * 1024 = number_of_pixels * (5 / 8) number_of_pixels = (18 * 1024 * 8) / 5 number_of_pixels ≈ 29491.2 Что противоречит самой постановке вопроса, так как количество пикселей должно быть целым числом. Похоже, что в исходном вопросе имеется расхождение или ошибка, так как снижение количества цветов с 512 (требующих 9 бит на пиксель) до 4 (2 бита на пиксель) снижает количество битов на 7 бит на пиксель, а не на 5. Давайте рассчитаем это правильно. Для исходного изображения со 512 цветами: bits_per_pixel_512 = log2(512) = log2(2^9) = 9 Таким образом, экономия составляет: bits_saved_per_pixel = bits_per_pixel_512 - bits_per_pixel_4 bits_saved_per_pixel = 9 - 2 bits_saved_per_pixel = 7 бит на пиксель Переводя экономию в байты и используя исправленное значение: bytes_saved_per_pixel = 7 / 8 Используя ту же формулу для расчёта: 18 * 1024 = number_of_pixels * bytes_saved_per_pixel number_of_pixels = (18 * 1024 * 8) / 7 number_of_pixels ≈ 21063.3 Это число пикселей для исходного файла при экономии в 7 бит на пиксель. Но поскольку количество пикселей должно быть целым числом, то, возможно, была допущена ошибка в условии задачи. Если предположить, что разница в размере файла была правильно указана и составляет 18 Кбайт, то размер исходного файла можно рассчитать следующим образом: Размер исходного файла = Размер конечного файла + Размер уменьшенного на 18 Кбайт Однако, чтобы рассчитать размер исходного файла, мы должны знать размер конечного файла, которого у нас нет. Если мы знали бы исходное число цветов (правильное значение — 512), можно было бы определить число бит на пиксель для исходного и преобразованного файла, на основании чего рассчитать количество пикселей в изображении (исходя из экономии данных), а затем размер исходного файла. После этого, зная количество пикселей, мы можем умножить на количество бит, которое нужно для представления каждого пикселя в исходном файле (9 бит) и получим общее количество бит, которое нужно будет перевести в байты и затем в килобайты для получения результата."},{"prompt":"Error: invalid expiresIn option for string payload","completion":"The error message \\"invalid expiresIn option for string payload\\" typically occurs when using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and indicates that there is an issue with the `expiresIn` option provided during the token\'s generation. When creating a JWT, you can specify an expiration time which denotes how long the token is valid before it needs to be refreshed or a new one needs to be obtained. Here\'s what you can do to resolve this error: 1. **Check the Expiration Value**: The `expiresIn` option requires a value that the library can parse into a valid expiration date. This can be a string denoting a time span (e.g., \\"2 days\\", \\"10h\\" for 10 hours, \\"7d\\" for 7 days) or a numeric value representing seconds until expiration (not milliseconds). Ensure that the value you have supplied adheres to one of these formats. 2. **Examine Token Generation Code**: Look at the code where you\'re generating the JWT token, specifically where you\'re setting the `expiresIn` property, and ensure it\'s correctly formatted. For example in Node.js using the `jsonwebtoken` library, it should look something like this: ```javascript const jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\'); const token = jwt.sign({ data: \'your_payload_data\' }, \'your_secret_key\', { expiresIn: \'1h\' // Expires in one hour }); ``` 3. **Verify Library Version**: If you\'re using a JWT library, make sure that you\'re using a version that supports the `expiresIn` option you are trying to use. If needed, consult the documentation for the library and check for any updates or breaking changes related to token expiration. 4. **Library-specific Checks**: Different libraries might have different requirements for the `expiresIn` value. Ensure that you are not violating any of these requirements. 5. **Ensure Payload is an Object**: While uncommon, some JWT libraries might expect the payload to be an object and not a string. If you\'re passing a string as the payload, ensure that\'s allowed or convert your string into an object. Here\'s an example: ```javascript const payload = { data: \'your_string_payload\' }; ``` If after these checks you\'re still encountering the issue, consider looking for examples or reaching out for support related to the specific library you\'re using.

}).join(\'\')); return JSON.parse(jsonPayload); } ``` # JWT Verify（验证） JWT `verify` 操作则是指验证JWT签名的真实性，并确认该令牌未被篡改且有效。这通常是服务器端进行的操作，服务器会使用签发JWT时的密钥（如果是对称加密算法，如HS256），或者使用相应的公钥（如果是非对称加密算法，如RS256）来验证签名。只有当验证通过后才会信任令牌中的信息，比如用来鉴权。 例如，使用Node.js中`jsonwebtoken`包进行验证操作： ```javascript const jwt = require(\'jsonwebtoken\');

// 返回上一个页面 Navigator.of(context).pop(); ``` # 2. 命名路由（Named Routes）： 可以在`MaterialApp`的`routes`参数中定义命名路由。 ```dart MaterialApp( // 应用的初始页面路由 initialRoute: \'/\', // 路由表 routes: { \'/\': (context) => HomePage(), \'/second\': (context) => SecondPage(), // 更多路由... }, ); ``` 使用`Navigator.pushNamed`和`Navigator.pop`来实现跳转与返回操作： ```dart // 通过路由名跳转到新页面 Navigator.pushNamed(context, \'/second\'); // 返回上一个页面 Navigator.pop(context); ``` # 3. 路由生成器（onGenerateRoute）： `onGenerateRoute`允许我们在进行导航时动态生成路由，对于传递数据或进行复杂导航场景很有用。 ```dart MaterialApp( onGenerateRoute: (settings) { if (settings.name == \'/third\') { final ThirdPageArguments args = settings.arguments; return MaterialPageRoute( builder: (context) => ThirdPage(args: args), ); } // 其他路由逻辑... }, ); ``` # 4. 自定义路由过渡（Transitions）： 要自定义页面之间的过渡，可以创建自己的PageRoute类或者使用PageRouteBuilder。 ```dart Navigator.of(context).push(PageRouteBuilder( pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => NewPage(), transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) { return FadeTransition(opacity: animation, child: child); }, )); ``` # 5. 使用插件： 一些Flutter插件和第三方库如`auto_route`, `fluro`, `get` 也提供了扩展的路由管理功能。 # 技巧和注意事项： - 对于需要传递复杂数据的路由，考虑使用`onGenerateRoute`来处理； - 保持路由结构简洁明了，便于管理； - 对于大型应用，可以考虑使用Routes类或路由管理插件，以减少路由代码的复杂性； - 使用`pushReplacement`或`pushAndRemoveUntil`来管理路由栈，以避免无限堆叠页面； - 注意在使用命名路由时，可能会需要处理类型转换，特别是当传递参数时。 路由管理是Flutter应用开发的核心部分，合理地管理路由将为用户提供更加流畅和直观的体验。"},{"prompt":"The following RenderObject was being processed when the exception was fired: _RenderListTile#f61c8 relayoutBoundary=up22 NEEDS-LAYOUT NEEDS-PAINT NEEDS-COMPOSITING-BITS-UPDATE: creator: _ListTile ← IconButtonTheme ← IconTheme ← Builder ← MediaQuery ← Padding ← SafeArea ← Builder ← Padding-[GlobalKey#99e46] ← Ink ← Semantics ← Listener ← ⋯","completion":"The exception message you posted indicates there was a problem with a `RenderObject` in the Flutter framework during the layout phase. The specific `RenderObject` in question is `_RenderListTile#f61c8`, which suggests that a `ListTile` widget is involved. The `NEEDS-LAYOUT`, `NEEDS-PAINT`, and `NEEDS-COMPOSITING-BITS-UPDATE` messages indicate that the object requires a layout, painting, and update to its compositing bits. These messages aren\'t the exception themselves but are part of the diagnostic output when an exception occurs. To resolve the exception, you\'ll need to look at the full error log, not just the snippet provided. The full log typically includes a description of the error as well as a stack trace that pinpoints where in your code the exception occurred. However, based on the output, here are a few general tips that could help you fix the issue: 1. **Widget Hierarchy**: Review the hierarchy around the `_ListTile` widget indicated by the trace. Sometimes, it\'s an issue of combining incompatible widgets or an incorrect hierarchy. 2. **State Management**: Check if state changes or `setState()` calls in your app might be causing widgets to be rebuilt in an inconsistent state, which can lead to layout issues. 3. **Overflow Errors**: Ensure that your layout doesn\'t lead to overflow errors. `ListTile` widgets and their contents should fit within their parent widgets. 4. **Customization**: If you\'ve customized the `ListTile` or its contents, make sure all custom widgets or themes are correctly implemented and do not introduce constraints that might lead to layout errors. 5. **Asynchronous Updates**: In case widgets are being updated based on asynchronous events, make sure those updates are handled properly, to prevent widgets from getting into an inconsistent state. 6. **Global Keys**: Notice the mention of a `GlobalKey` in the trace (`Padding-[GlobalKey#99e46]`). Make sure the global key is used correctly and not leading to issues with your widget tree. To diagnose the problem more precisely, try to comment out parts of the widget tree until the error disappears, then gradually reintroduce each part to isolate the source of the error. Additionally, consider enabling the Flutter inspector in your IDE, which can help visualize the widget tree and may highlight issues. Always examine the error message that precedes the RenderObject details, as it will typically provide more information about the root cause of the layout issue."},{"prompt":"bottomNavigationBar将其去除","completion":"在Flutter中，如果你想去掉`Scaffold`的`bottomNavigationBar`，可以通过简单地移除该属性来实现。 让我们看一下带有和不带有`bottomNavigationBar`的基本`Scaffold`结构的区别。 带有`bottomNavigationBar`的`Scaffold`可能看起来像这样： ```dart Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text(\'My App\'), ), body: Center( child: Text(\'Hello World!\'), ), bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar( items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[ BottomNavigationBarItem( icon: Icon(Icons.home), label: \'Home\', ), BottomNavigationBarItem( icon: Icon(Icons.business), label: \'Business\', ), BottomNavigationBarItem( icon: Icon(Icons.school), label: \'School\', ), ], ), ); ``` 要去掉`bottomNavigationBar`，只需移除或注释掉`Scaffold`构造器中的`bottomNavigationBar`参数即可。如下所示： ```dart Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text(\'My App\'), ), body: Center( child: Text(\'Hello World!\'), ), // bottomNavigationBar 被移除或注释掉 // bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar( // items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[ // BottomNavigationBarItem( // icon: Icon(Icons.home), // label: \'Home\', // ), // BottomNavigationBarItem( // icon: Icon(Icons.business), // label: \'Business\', // ), // BottomNavigationBarItem( // icon: Icon(Icons.school), // label: \'School\', // ), // ], // ), ); ``` 移除了`bottomNavigationBar`属性后，当你运行应用，会看到`bottomNavigationBar`不再显示在屏幕底部。 如果要在某些条件下显示或隐藏`bottomNavigationBar`，你可以根据条件返回一个`BottomNavigationBar`实例或者`null`。例如： ```dart bool shouldShowBottomNavBar = true; // 假设这是你的条件变量 Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text(\'My App\'), ), body: Center( child: Text(\'Hello World!\'), ), bottomNavigationBar: shouldShowBottomNavBar ?

Он дал нашему виду наименование Homo sapiensи выделил внутри него четыре разновидности. Термин “раса”, эквивалентный линнеевскому термину “разновидность”, был введен в научный оборот натуралистом Жоржем-Луи Леклерком графом Бюффоном в 1749 году. Бюффон подразделял человечество нашесть рас и прозорливо предположил, что их формирование объясняется воздействием окружающей среды. Однако наибольшее влияние на последующее развитие расовой доктрины оказал один из основоположников антропологии Иоганн Фридрих Блюменбах. В 1775 году он защитил в Гёттингенском университете диссертацию на степень доктора медицины, в которой обосновывалось разделение человечества на четыре разновидности. Особую популярность снискало ее третье переработанное издание, вышедшее в 1795 году. Там было описано уже пять основных рас: кавказская, или кавказоидная (белая), монголоидная (желтая), эфиопская (черная), американоидная (красная) и малайская (коричневая). Эта расовая классификация с теми или иными модификациями, по существу, дожила до наших дней. Биологи и антропологи, занимавшиеся такими построениями, образовали два противостоящих лагеря. Одни ученые, названные моногенистами, склонялись к мнению, что люди были сотворены Богом лишь однажды и только относительно недавно произошла их дифференциация на отдельные расы; другие же, названные полигенистами, верили, что расы были созданы Богом в начале творенияи, следовательно, существуют с глубокой древности. К концу XX века точка зрения наследников моногенистов одержала убедительную победу. Начало коренному повороту в эволюции представлений о расах, растянувшемуся почти на столетие, положила книга Дарвина о происхождении человека и человечества, опубликованная в 1871 году [4]. Он рассмотрел вопрос о расах с позицийсвоей эволюционной теории. Его идеи подготовили почву для последующего отказа от представлений о статичности и дискретности человеческих рас, лежавших в основе господствовавшей на протяжении десятилетий типологической концепции расы. Дарвин полагал, что главной движущей силой расообразования у человека являлся половой отбор; благодаря действию этого фактора произошла дивергенция нашего видана отдельные подвиды — расы. Вместе с тем он обратил внимание на факты, свидетельствующие о плодовитости межрасовых браков и постепенном переходе одних рас в другие, факты, наводящие на мысль об условности любых расовых классификаций. Дарвиновские идеи относительно природы рас человека были подхвачены некоторыми антропологами, активно публиковавшимися в первой половине XX века. Из них наиболее известными являются Франц Боас и Эшли Монтагу. Боас в начале прошлого столетия представил убедительные антропометрические данные, опровергающие представление о расах как обособленных группах; он показал, что многие индивиды из соседних расовых групп не могут быть с определенностью отнесены к той или иной расе. Монтагу оставил яркий след в истории науки и общественной мысли во многом благодаря своей книге “Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race”,первое издание которой вышло в 1942 году [38]. Как ясно уже из названия, автор считал понятие о расе самым опасным мифом в истории человечества. Он одним из первых попытался обосновать точку зрения, что человеческие расы как объекты биологической таксономии не существуют. Это исключительно социальные конструкции, не отражающие биологических различий между людьми. Их сходство намного перевешивает имеющиеся различия. Беспочвенные спекуляции, основанные наложной концепции расы, открывают путь расизму и нацизму. Последний тезис получил зримое подтверждение в событиях европейской и мировой истории, разворачивавшихся во время работы над книгой. Шестью годами ранее появилась другая резонансная книга о расовой проблематике, написанная выдающимся эволюционистом, одним из творцов СТЭ (синтетической теории эволюции) Джулианом Хаксли в соавторстве с антропологом Альфредом Хэддоном. Основная ее идея сводится к тезису, что раса,понимаемая как большая группа людей, имеющих общее происхождение и одинаковые биологические признаки, — это продукт воображения некоторых антропологов, потерявших связь с реальной действительностью [31]. Вместе с тем авторы допускают, что “чистые расы” могли существовать в далеком прошлом, при первичном разделении человечества на географические общности. В 1950 году ЮНЕСКО обнародовало свое первое Заявление о расе, которое в качестве докладчика представил Монтагу [55].Там, в частности, есть такое радикальное утверждение: «доказано, что дифференциация видов на биологически определяемые “расы” бессмысленна». Ряд влиятельных ученых сочли это заявление политически мотивированным и нуждающимся в коренной переработке. В результате в 1951 году появилось новое Заявление о расе (в позднейших анналах ЮНЕСКО фигурирует под названием Statement on the nature of race and race differences), отражавшее точку зрения большинства ведущих антропологов и биологов того времени, которые нисколько не сомневались в существовании рас. Генетика имеет первостепенное значение для понимания природы рас человека. Ведь расы выделялись на основе относительно небольшого числа фенотипических признаков, характеризующих пигментацию кожи, волос и глаз, структуру волос, толщину и форму губ, форму носа. В то же время в традиционных определениях рас человека подчеркивается, что они представляют собой “исторически сложившиеся группы людей, связанные единством происхождения” [1, с. 16–25]. Иными словами, представители разных рас происходят от разных родоначальников. А если это так, то люди одной расы должны обладать бoльшим генеалогическим родством, чем индивиды, принадлежащие к разным расам. Как написано в одном из американских словарей: “Расовая группа подобна большой расширенной семье; люди, к ней принадлежащие, имеют общих предков, в какой-то степени инбредны и обладают определенным физическим сходством, поскольку у них общие гены”. Но отражают ли различия по весьма ограниченному набору фенотипических признаков, использовавшихся при выделении рас, генеалогию людей и их популяций? Ответ на этот вопрос может быть получен только с помощью генетики, а исчерпывающий ответ — с помощью геномики. И уже в 2002 году вышла работа, в которой были представлены результаты изучения генетической структуры человечества с использованием 377 ДНК(маркеров, отражающих изменчивость геномов 1056 человек из 52 этносов [45]. Операциональными единицами этого исследования были не произвольно выделенные “популяции”, как в генетических работах 1970–1990-х годов, а отдельные индивиды. В результате компьютерных вычислений с использованием специальной программы эти индивиды разделились на группы, соответствующие их географическому происхождению из таких основных регионов мира, как Африка, Европа, Ближний Восток, Центральная и Южная Азия, Восточная Азия, Океания и Америки. Но ведь многие антропологи до сих пор отождествляют население каждого из этих больших регионов с определенной расой. Можно ли считать совпадение географических и генетических группировок, установленное в данной работе, доказательством существования рас? Более точный и убедительный ответ на вопрос о соответствии между расой и генеалогией индивидов может быть получен только на основании данных о целостных геномах. Уже первые работы по полногеномному сравнению людей показали, что вопрос этот не так прост. Первыми индивидами, геномы которых были полностью расшифрованы, стали Джеймс Уотсон, упомянутый Крейг Вентер и корейский ученый Сионг-Джин Ким [12]. Уотсон и Вентер имеют европейское происхождение (т.е. они европеоиды), а Ким — азиатское (т.е. он, по расовой принадлежности, монголоид). Так вот оказалось, что Уотсон и Вентер одинаковы по 1715851 маркеру ДНК, а ДНК Кима совпадает с их ДНК по 1824482 и 1736340 маркерам, соответственно. Иными словами, геномы этих “европеоидов” больше отличаются друг от друга, чем от генома “монголоида”. Результат очевидно не совсем типичный (геномные различия между индивидами разной расовой принадлежности в большинстве случаев должны быть больше геномных различий между индивидами другой расы), но все же показательный. Так или иначе, приходится констатировать, что геномика пока не дала бесспорного ответа на вопрос о существовании рас. Более того, некоторые считают, что использование геномных технологий привело к окончательной смене парадигмы во взглядах на природу человеческих рас [45], укрепившей позиции противников представления об их биологической реальности.","completion":"В 1735 году Карл Линней, отец биологической таксономии, создал первую научную классификацию современных людей.

Он дал нашему виду наименование Homo sapiensи выделил внутри него четыре разновидности. Термин “раса”, эквивалентный линнеевскому термину “разновидность”, был введен в научный оборот натуралистом Жоржем-Луи Леклерком графом Бюффоном в 1749 году. Бюффон подразделял человечество нашесть рас и прозорливо предположил, что их формирование объясняется воздействием окружающей среды. Однако наибольшее влияние на последующее развитие расовой доктрины оказал один из основоположников антропологии Иоганн Фридрих Блюменбах. В 1775 году он защитил в Гёттингенском университете диссертацию на степень доктора медицины, в которой обосновывалось разделение человечества на четыре разновидности. Особую популярность снискало ее третье переработанное издание, вышедшее в 1795 году. Там было описано уже пять основных рас: кавказская, или кавказоидная (белая), монголоидная (желтая), эфиопская (черная), американоидная (красная) и малайская (коричневая). Эта расовая классификация с теми или иными модификациями, по существу, дожила до наших дней. Биологи и антропологи, занимавшиеся такими построениями, образовали два противостоящих лагеря. Одни ученые, названные моногенистами, склонялись к мнению, что люди были сотворены Богом лишь однажды и только относительно недавно произошла их дифференциация на отдельные расы; другие же, названные полигенистами, верили, что расы были созданы Богом в начале творенияи, следовательно, существуют с глубокой древности. К концу XX века точка зрения наследников моногенистов одержала убедительную победу. Начало коренному повороту в эволюции представлений о расах, растянувшемуся почти на столетие, положила книга Дарвина о происхождении человека и человечества, опубликованная в 1871 году [4]. Он рассмотрел вопрос о расах с позицийсвоей эволюционной теории. Его идеи подготовили почву для последующего отказа от представлений о статичности и дискретности человеческих рас, лежавших в основе господствовавшей на протяжении десятилетий типологической концепции расы. Дарвин полагал, что главной движущей силой расообразования у человека являлся половой отбор; благодаря действию этого фактора произошла дивергенция нашего видана отдельные подвиды — расы. Вместе с тем он обратил внимание на факты, свидетельствующие о плодовитости межрасовых браков и постепенном переходе одних рас в другие, факты, наводящие на мысль об условности любых расовых классификаций. Дарвиновские идеи относительно природы рас человека были подхвачены некоторыми антропологами, активно публиковавшимися в первой половине XX века. Из них наиболее известными являются Франц Боас и Эшли Монтагу. Боас в начале прошлого столетия представил убедительные антропометрические данные, опровергающие представление о расах как обособленных группах; он показал, что многие индивиды из соседних расовых групп не могут быть с определенностью отнесены к той или иной расе. Монтагу оставил яркий след в истории науки и общественной мысли во многом благодаря своей книге “Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race”,первое издание которой вышло в 1942 году [38]. Как ясно уже из названия, автор считал понятие о расе самым опасным мифом в истории человечества. Он одним из первых попытался обосновать точку зрения, что человеческие расы как объекты биологической таксономии не существуют. Это исключительно социальные конструкции, не отражающие биологических различий между людьми. Их сходство намного перевешивает имеющиеся различия. Беспочвенные спекуляции, основанные наложной концепции расы, открывают путь расизму и нацизму. Последний тезис получил зримое подтверждение в событиях европейской и мировой истории, разворачивавшихся во время работы над книгой. Шестью годами ранее появилась другая резонансная книга о расовой проблематике, написанная выдающимся эволюционистом, одним из творцов СТЭ (синтетической теории эволюции) Джулианом Хаксли в соавторстве с антропологом Альфредом Хэддоном. Основная ее идея сводится к тезису, что раса,понимаемая как большая группа людей, имеющих общее происхождение и одинаковые биологические признаки, — это продукт воображения некоторых антропологов, потерявших связь с реальной действительностью [31]. Вместе с тем авторы допускают, что “чистые расы” могли существовать в далеком прошлом, при первичном разделении человечества на географические общности. В 1950 году ЮНЕСКО обнародовало свое первое Заявление о расе, которое в качестве докладчика представил Монтагу [55].Там, в частности, есть такое радикальное утверждение: «доказано, что дифференциация видов на биологически определяемые “расы” бессмысленна». Ряд влиятельных ученых сочли это заявление политически мотивированным и нуждающимся в коренной переработке. В результате в 1951 году появилось новое Заявление о расе (в позднейших анналах ЮНЕСКО фигурирует под названием Statement on the nature of race and race differences), отражавшее точку зрения большинства ведущих антропологов и биологов того времени, которые нисколько не сомневались в существовании рас. Генетика имеет первостепенное значение для понимания природы рас человека. Ведь расы выделялись на основе относительно небольшого числа фенотипических признаков, характеризующих пигментацию кожи, волос и глаз, структуру волос, толщину и форму губ, форму носа. В то же время в традиционных определениях рас человека подчеркивается, что они представляют собой “исторически сложившиеся группы людей, связанные единством происхождения” [1, с. 16–25]. Иными словами, представители разных рас происходят от разных родоначальников. А если это так, то люди одной расы должны обладать бoльшим генеалогическим родством, чем индивиды, принадлежащие к разным расам. Как написано в одном из американских словарей: “Расовая группа подобна большой расширенной семье; люди, к ней принадлежащие, имеют общих предков, в какой-то степени инбредны и обладают определенным физическим сходством, поскольку у них общие гены”. Но отражают ли различия по весьма ограниченному набору фенотипических признаков, использовавшихся при выделении рас, генеалогию людей и их популяций? Ответ на этот вопрос может быть получен только с помощью генетики, а исчерпывающий ответ — с помощью геномики. И уже в 2002 году вышла работа, в которой были представлены результаты изучения генетической структуры человечества с использованием 377 ДНК(маркеров, отражающих изменчивость геномов 1056 человек из 52 этносов [45]. Операциональными единицами этого исследования были не произвольно выделенные “популяции”, как в генетических работах 1970–1990-х годов, а отдельные индивиды. В результате компьютерных вычислений с использованием специальной программы эти индивиды разделились на группы, соответствующие их географическому происхождению из таких основных регионов мира, как Африка, Европа, Ближний Восток, Центральная и Южная Азия, Восточная Азия, Океания и Америки. Но ведь многие антропологи до сих пор отождествляют население каждого из этих больших регионов с определенной расой. Можно ли считать совпадение географических и генетических группировок, установленное в данной работе, доказательством существования рас? Более точный и убедительный ответ на вопрос о соответствии между расой и генеалогией индивидов может быть получен только на основании данных о целостных геномах. Уже первые работы по полногеномному сравнению людей показали, что вопрос этот не так прост. Первыми индивидами, геномы которых были полностью расшифрованы, стали Джеймс Уотсон, упомянутый Крейг Вентер и корейский ученый Сионг-Джин Ким [12]. Уотсон и Вентер имеют европейское происхождение (т.е. они европеоиды), а Ким — азиатское (т.е. он, по расовой принадлежности, монголоид). Так вот оказалось, что Уотсон и Вентер одинаковы по 1715851 маркеру ДНК, а ДНК Кима совпадает с их ДНК по 1824482 и 1736340 маркерам, соответственно. Иными словами, геномы этих “европеоидов” больше отличаются друг от друга, чем от генома “монголоида”. Результат очевидно не совсем типичный (геномные различия между индивидами разной расовой принадлежности в большинстве случаев должны быть больше геномных различий между индивидами другой расы), но все же показательный. Так или иначе, приходится констатировать, что геномика пока не дала бесспорного ответа на вопрос о существовании рас. Более того, некоторые считают, что использование геномных технологий привело к окончательной смене парадигмы во взглядах на природу человеческих рас [45], укрепившей позиции противников представления об их биологической реальности.","completion":"В 1735 году Карл Линней, отец биологической таксономии, создал первую научную классификацию современных людей.

Aunque ambos términos implican conocimiento adquirido a través de la experiencia, se diferencian significativamente en su confiabilidad, generalización y uso en contextos científicos y cotidianos. Evidencia empírica: - La evidencia empírica se refiere a la información recogida a través de la observación sistemática, la experimentación o cualquier otra metodología que permita recopilar datos objetivos y verificables. - En el ámbito científico, la evidencia empírica es fundamental, ya que permite formular, probar y refinar hipótesis y teorías. - Los hallazgos empíricos suelen basarse en muestras más grandes y métodos de recolección de datos controlados para asegurar que los resultados sean representativos y replicables. - La evidencia empírica puede ser cualitativa o cuantitativa, pero siempre se recoge y analiza utilizando procedimientos rigurosos y transparentes. Anécdota: - Una anécdota es un relato no sistematizado basado en experiencias personales o casos aislados. Tales relatos pueden incluir historias, testimonios o narraciones que reflejan las percepciones individuales de eventos o situaciones. - Las anécdotas son subjetivas y no necesariamente representativas de experiencias comunes o patrones más amplios. - A menudo se utilizan en conversaciones cotidianas o discursos persuasivos para ilustrar un punto, pero carecen de la rigurosidad necesaria para establecer una evidencia sólida en términos científicos. - Las anécdotas tienen un valor limitado cuando se trata de fundamentar políticas o prácticas porque pueden estar sesgadas y no se basan en un análisis sistemático. En resumen, mientras que la evidencia empírica se busca para fundamentar teorías y prácticas de forma confiable y replicable, las anécdotas pueden ser útiles para identificar áreas de interés o para ilustrar puntos en discursos narrativos. Sin embargo, utilizar anécdotas como si fueran evidencia empírica puede llevar a conclusiones erróneas debido a su naturaleza inherentemente sesgada y no representativa."},{"prompt":"Por ejemplo \\"en los 90 estuvo el neoliberalismo y terminamos en la crisis del 2001\\" en qué tipo de información se alinea?","completion":"La afirmación \\"en los 90 estuvo el neoliberalismo y terminamos en la crisis del 2001\\" se parece más a una anécdota histórica que a evidencia empírica, ya que simplifica una serie de eventos complejos en una secuencia causal directa. Expliquemos por qué se alinea más con una anécdota que con evidencia empírica: **Anécdota/Relato Histórico:** 1. **Narrativa simplificada:** Esta afirmación resume una década entera de política económica y eventos financieros a una simple relación causal, lo que podría pasar por alto la complejidad de los factores económicos, políticos y sociales que llevaron a la crisis. 2. **Falta de especificidad:** Aunque el término \\"neoliberalismo\\" describe un conjunto de políticas económicas centradas en la reducción del papel del estado, la liberalización del comercio y los mercados, y la privatización de empresas estatales, no especifica cuáles políticas exactas o acciones gobierno o factores externos podrían haber contribuido a la crisis. 3. **Contexto personal o cultural:** Dependiendo de quién haga la afirmación, podría estar basada en su interpretación personal de los eventos o en la narrativa que prevalece en su cultura o en su entorno político. **Evidencia Empírica:** Para convertir la afirmación en evidencia empírica, se requeriría: 1. **Datos concretos:** Presentar estadísticas económicas, estudios y análisis detallados que demuestren cómo las políticas neoliberales específicas adoptadas en los años 90 llevaron a desenlaces económicos que predijeron o causaron la crisis financiera de 2001. 2. **Metodología rigurosa:** Utilizar métodos económicos y estadísticos estándares para investigar la relación entre las políticas implementadas durante la década y los resultados económicos, controlando otros factores. 3. **Análisis crítico:** Un examen crítico de las políticas neoliberales debería incluir una revisión de la literatura económica existente sobre el impacto de dichas políticas en diferentes contextos y periodos de tiempo. La crisis económica de 2001, especialmente en el caso de Argentina, fue el resultado de múltiples factores, incluyendo políticas económicas internas, condiciones de los mercados internacionales, comportamiento de inversores y decisiones políticas, entre otros. Atribuir una crisis económica compleja a una sola causa no refleja la naturaleza multifacética de las crisis económicas y no representa una evaluación empírica rigurosa de los eventos históricos. Una comprensión completa de la crisis del 2001 requeriría un análisis empírico detallado que identifique y cuantifique las contribuciones específicas de diversas políticas y factores externos."},{"prompt":"Привет, перескажешь для меня текст?","completion":"Конечно!

Pendant la métaphase, les chromosomes préalablement dupliqués durant l\'interphase atteignent leur plus haut niveau de condensation. Chaque chromosome est composé de deux chromatides sœurs, qui sont des répliques identiques de l\'ADN de ce chromosome, reliées au niveau d\'une structure appelée centromère. Voici les étapes principales qui mènent à l\'individualisation des chromosomes en métaphase : 1. **Condensation des chromosomes** : À partir de la prophase, les chromosomes commencent à se condenser grâce à l\'action de protéines structurelles telles que les condensines et de superenroulements d\'ADN. Cette condensation permet de passer d\'un long fil d\'ADN étendu à une structure compacte et maniable. 2. **Alignement à l\'équateur de la cellule** : Pendant la métaphase, les chromosomes alignés atteignent leur condensation maximale et les paires de chromatides sœurs se disposent à l\'équateur de la cellule. Cette zone équatoriale est aussi appelée plaque métaphasique. 3. **Attachement aux fibres du fuseau mitotique** : Les centromères des chromosomes se lient aux fibres du fuseau mitotique, qui émanent des centrosomes situés aux pôles opposés de la cellule. Les kinétochores, des structures protéiques situées sur les centromères, servent de point d\'ancrage aux microtubules. 4. **Tension sur les chromosomes** : Les forces de traction exercées par les microtubules des fuseaux mitotiques attachés aux kinétochores génèrent une tension et alignent parfaitement les chromosomes à l\'équateur de la cellule. Ce mécanisme assure une séparation égale des chromatides sœurs lors de la transition vers l\'anaphase. À ce moment de la mitose, chaque chromosome est individualisé et reconnaissable, permettant aux cellules de s\'assurer que la distribution de l\'ADN se fera équitablement entre les deux cellules filles lors de la séparation. La précision de ce processus est essentielle pour la fidélité génétique et pour prévenir des erreurs de ségrégation chromosomique, qui peuvent entraîner des anomalies génétiques ou des maladies comme les cancers ou les trisomies."},{"prompt":"Comment ils étaient a la prophase","completion":"Lors de la prophase, première phase de la mitose après l\'interphase, plusieurs événements clés préparent la cellule à la division. À ce stade, les chromosomes commencent à devenir visibles, mais ils ne sont pas encore complètement individualisés et alignés comme ils le seront plus tard en métaphase. Voici les principales caractéristiques et processus qui se déroulent au cours de la prophase : 1. **Condensation des chromosomes** : L\'ADN qui était précédemment sous une forme décondensée et étalée dans le noyau (également appelée chromatine), commence à se condenser. Cette condensation est médiée par des complexes protéiques comme les condensines, et l\'ADN s\'enroule autour des protéines histones pour former des structures plus denses et visibles sous la forme de chromosomes. 2. **Début de formation du fuseau mitotique** : Le cytosquelette de la cellule commence à se réorganiser pour former le fuseau mitotique à partir des centrosomes (qui sont des centres organisateurs des microtubules). Chez les cellules animales, les centrosomes se dédoublent et migrent vers des pôles opposés de la cellule. 3. **Disparition du nucléole** : Le nucléole, centre de production des ribosomes dans le noyau, commence à disparaître. 4. **Dégradation de l\'enveloppe nucléaire** : L\'enveloppe nucléaire qui entoure le noyau se dissout progressivement, permettant aux microtubules du fuseau mitotique d\'interagir avec les chromosomes. 5. **Première apparition des chromatides** : À cette étape, chaque chromosome déjà répliqué est composé de deux chromatides sœurs unies par un centromère. Les chromatides sont encore attachées entre elles et ne seront séparées que plus tard lors de l\'anaphase. 6. **Apparition des kinétochores** : Des structures protéiques appelées kinétochores commencent à se former sur les centromères des chromosomes. Ces kinétochores joueront ensuite un rôle clé dans l\'attachement des chromosomes aux fibres du fuseau mitotique. Pendant la prophase, les chromosomes ne sont pas encore alignés le long d\'une plaque métaphasique à l\'équateur cellulaire, comme c\'est le cas en métaphase. Ils se préparent néanmoins à cette organisation en s\'orientant correctement grâce à leur condensation progressive et à la mise en place des structures nécessaires pour la future séparation des chromatides en anaphase."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The 80s were a pivotal decade for Bombay, sandwiched between the post-independence era and the cusp of economic liberalization that would begin in the early 90s. Here\'s a snapshot of what Bombay might have been like in the 1980s: 1. Urban Landscape: - The cityscape was dotted with Art Deco buildings and Victorian Gothic architecture, with fewer high-rises than today. - Landmarks like the Gateway of India, Marine Drive (Queen\'s Necklace), and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel stood as iconic staples. - The streets were less crowded, with fewer cars and the omnipresent black-and-yellow Fiat Padmini taxis. 2. Transport: - The local trains, the lifeline of Bombay, were less packed compared to present times, but still bustling with commuters. - BEST buses were a common sight, carrying citizens across the city\'s multiple neighborhoods. - The iconic double-decker buses would have been a popular mode of transport among daily commuters. 3. Economy and Industry: - Bombay was the financial and commercial capital with the Bombay Stock Exchange driving economic activities. - The city housed many textile mills, which were major sources of employment but were also on the verge of decline due to industry shifts. - The underworld\'s influence on trade, such as smuggling goods and controlling certain industries, was a noted aspect of the city\'s darker side. 4. Culture and Entertainment: - Bollywood was at its prime with stars like Amitabh Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, and Sridevi ruling the silver screen. New-wave cinema was also finding its ground with directors like Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani. - The music scene blended traditional Indian music with disco influences from the West. - Street food culture was vibrant, with vada pav, pav bhaji, and bhel puri being popular snacks. 5. Society and Lifestyle: - A mix of cosmopolitan and traditional lifestyles coexisted. You\'d find modern cafes and traditional Irani restaurants. - The city\'s nightlife was buzzing, with clubs and discos that played the latest international hits and Bollywood numbers. - The fashion was a blend of western and traditional Indian dress, with bright colors and bold patterns. 6. Politics and Events: - The political scene was dominated by the Congress Party and the Shiv Sena was rising as a significant force. - Social issues like the rights of mill workers and the growing slum population were major topics of discussion. - Events like the Bombay Dock Explosion in 1944 were still in living memory, while the city\'s resilience continued to be a defining trait.

It was a place of dreams and struggles, reflecting the complex narrative of India itself during a particularly transformative era."}]'),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function N(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+h(o.searchQuery)+'".
