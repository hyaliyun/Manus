You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.)","completion":"MC: \\"Oh no!

Just remember to breathe and trust us.\\" Natsuki: (nervous but determined) \\"I trust you all. Let's bring Sakura into this world together.\\" (With each contraction, Natsuki pushes with the guidance of Sayori and Yuri. They support her, wiping her brow and offering words of encouragement.) Sayori: \\"You're doing amazing, Natsuki! Just a little more, and Sakura will be with us.\\" Yuri: \\"Remember to take deep breaths and push when we say so, Natsuki. We're almost there.\\" (Natsuki pushes with all her strength, following the instructions of Sayori and Yuri. The room fills with tension as they work together to bring Sakura into the world.) Monika: \\"I can see the head, Natsuki! Keep pushing, you're doing fantastic!\\" Natsuki: (grunting) \\"I-I can do this! Just a little more!\\" (Suddenly, the room is filled with cries, and the tension releases as Sakura is born. The club members let out sighs of relief and tears of joy fill their eyes.) Sayori: (teary-eyed) \\"You did it, Natsuki! Sakura is here!\\" Yuri: (holding the baby) \\"She's so beautiful. Congratulations, Natsuki.\\" MC: (overwhelmed with joy) \\"We did it, Natsuki! Sakura is finally here!\\" Natsuki: (exhausted, but filled with love) \\"She's...she's perfect. Thank you, everyone.\\" (While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, the club members ensure that Natsuki and Sakura are comfortable and safe. They celebrate the little miracle that has entered their lives, grateful for the strength and support they've shown each other.)"},{"prompt":"How to expose Lambda function without API Gateway","completion":"To expose a Lambda function without using API Gateway, you have a few options: 1. Direct Invocation: You can invoke the Lambda function directly using the AWS SDK or CLI. However, this method requires authentication and permission configuration for each invoker, so it's not recommended for publicly exposing your function. 2. AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB): You can set up an ALB in front of your Lambda function and configure it to forward the incoming requests to the Lambda function. This method requires some setup and configuration, but it allows you to balance the load across multiple instances of the Lambda function and provide more advanced routing options. 3. AWS EventBridge: You can configure an EventBridge rule to trigger your Lambda function based on specific events. This method is useful when you want to expose your Lambda function as a consumer for certain events, but it may not be suitable for general-purpose use. 4. AWS CloudFront: Set up a CloudFront distribution and configure it to point to your Lambda function. This allows you to use CloudFront's caching, SSL termination, and other features, but it adds some complexity to your architecture. 5. Third-party solutions: There are also some third-party solutions available that provide a simple way to expose Lambda functions via HTTP endpoints, such as Serverless Framework's \`serverless-http\` plugin or Netlify Functions. It's important to note that API Gateway is the recommended way to expose and manage Lambda functions in most cases, as it provides features like request validation, authentication, authorization, and throttling. But if you have specific use cases or constraints where you don't want to use API Gateway, you can consider these alternatives."},{"prompt":"I remember there is feature provided by Lambda service directly. What's that?","completion":"Apologies for the oversight. You are correct, AWS Lambda offers a feature called \\"Lambda Proxy Integration\\" that allows you to expose a Lambda function directly without using API Gateway. This feature enables you to create a custom AWS Lambda function as an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint. Here is how you can use Lambda Proxy Integration to expose a Lambda function: 1. Create your Lambda function: Write your Lambda function code in the required programming language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java, etc.) to handle incoming HTTP requests. 2. Configure the Lambda function's trigger: In the AWS Lambda console, configure your function's trigger to be an API Gateway REST endpoint. This process can also be done using the AWS CLI or SDKs. 3. Handle incoming request and response: When using Lambda Proxy Integration, your Lambda function needs to read the incoming request event and generate an HTTP response as per the API Gateway integration request/response format. You can access the incoming request parameters, headers, body, and other details from the event object passed to the Lambda function. 4. Set up permissions: Ensure that the IAM role assigned to your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to process the incoming requests, interact with other AWS services if required, and generate the appropriate HTTP response. By following these steps, you can directly expose your Lambda function as an HTTP endpoint without using API Gateway. Note that although this option exists, using API Gateway for most scenarios is still recommended for its additional features, customization options, and ease of managing APIs."},{"prompt":"Please provide Python sample code which realizes SageMaker Batch Transform Job calling in Lambda","completion":"Certainly!

However, on average, the initiation of a SageMaker Batch Transform job generally takes a few minutes. During the initiation process, SageMaker sets up the required resources and provisions the specified instance(s) to perform the transformation. The time taken for this setup depends on the size and complexity of the input data, as well as the instance type chosen. It's important to note that the actual execution time of the Batch Transform job, which refers to the time taken to process the entire dataset, may vary depending on the factors mentioned above.

Tenha em mente que esses efeitos podem alterar a qualidade do áudio, o que pode afetar o treinamento e a precisão do seu modelo de reconhecimento de voz. Portanto, é importante testar e validar a utilidade de cada tipo de augmentação de dados no contexto específico da sua aplicação. As alterações específicas feitas na função create_effect_filename devem refletir os efeitos de áudio que estão sendo aplicados, descrevendo corretamente o processo de augmentação para cada arquivo de saída. Adaptar corretamente essa função é crítico para garantir que os arquivos de dados de treinamento sejam rastreados e catalogados corretamente. erro: Exception has occurred: OSError (note: full exception trace is shown but execution is paused at: run_module_as_main) [WinError 6] O identificador é inválido File \\"C:UsersvaniaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython38Libtkinter_init.py\\", line 1883, in call return self.func(args) File “C:meucomparar1arquivocomoutrosreorganizado_MFCCs_parametros.py”, line 3282, in apply_all_effects apply_pitch_shift(input_file, output_file, pitch_rate) File “C:meucomparar1arquivocomoutrosreorganizado_MFCCs_parametros.py”, line 2661, in apply_pitch_shift subprocess.run(command, check=True) File “C:UsersvaniaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython38Libsubprocess.py”, line 512, in run raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args, subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '[‘ffmpeg’, ‘-i’, ‘c:meupara_fazer_augmentationcommand_quatro_1702262103_1.wav’, ‘-filter_complex’, 'asetrate=r=441000.9,aresample=r=44100’, ‘c:meuresultado_augmentationcommand_quatro_1702262103_1_0,9_pitchshift.wav’]’ returned non-zero exit status 1. tenho: def apply_all_effects(): global delay, decay # Definir os limites e incrementos para cada parâmetro speed_range = [0.5 + i * 0.1 for i in range(16)] # 0.5 até 2.0 com incremento de 0.1 pitch_range = list(range(-12, 13, 1)) # -12 até +12 com incremento de 1 reverb_range = [0.1 + i * 0.1 for i in range(10)] # 0.1 até 1.0 com incremento de 0.1 noise_range = [0.0 + i * 0.1 for i in range(11)] # 0.0 até 1.0 com incremento de 0.1 # Os valores fornecidos aqui são exemplos.

Certifique-se de que o ffmpeg está instalado corretamente e acessível no ambiente onde o seu script Python está sendo executado. Você pode testar isso rodando ffmpeg -version num terminal ou prompt de comando. 2. O erro O identificador é inválido pode estar ligado a problemas de escrita no sistema de arquivos ou a caracteres inválidos nos nomes de arquivos. Certifique-se de que o diretório de destino (augmentation_folder) existe e que você tem permissões de escrita nele. Além disso, se você estiver executando o script em um ambiente onde a substituição de vírgulas por pontos (ou vice-versa) pode estar acontecendo, tente executar a função pitch shift com valores que não necessitam de ponto decimal (por exemplo, 1 ou 0.9 e não 0,9). 3. A mensagem de erro Incorrect codec parameters indica que os parâmetros para o codec do ffmpeg não são suportados ou foram mal formados. No seu comando de Pitch Shifting, verifique se a sintaxe do filtro está correta e não há espaços extra ou caracteres inválidos. Além disso, pode ser necessário especificar parâmetros adicionais após o aresample, como a taxa de amostragem de destino. 4. Mude o pitch_rate para uma string formatada de forma correta antes de passá-lo para o comando. A vírgula pode ser interpretada incorretamente no contexto de um comando de terminal se o seu sistema operacional estiver configurado para usar a vírgula como separador decimal. Verifique isso e troque a vírgula por um ponto se necessário. Tendo feito essas verificações, ajuste a chamada para o efeito pitch shift conforme necessário: def apply_pitch_shift(input_file, output_file, pitch_rate=1.1): # Formatar o pitch_rate para uma string em formato float com ponto como separador decimal pitch_rate_str = “{:.2f}”.format(pitch_rate).replace(‘,’, ‘.’) # Garante que o separador decimal seja um ponto command = [ ‘ffmpeg’, ‘-i’, input_file, ‘-filter_complex’, f’asetrate=r=44100*{pitch_rate_str},aresample=r=44100’, output_file ] subprocess.run(command, check=True) Ajuste também o efeito de criação de nomes de arquivo para garantir que o nome esteja correto: def create_effect_filename(input_file, augmentation_folder, effect_descriptor, effect_type): effect_descriptor_str = str(effect_descriptor).replace(‘.’, '') # Substitui o ponto por underscore base_filename = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(input_file))[0] output_filename = f\\"{base_filename}{effect_descriptor_str}{effect_type}.wav\\" return os.path.join(augmentation_folder, output_filename) Essa função altera qualquer ponto decimal no descritor do efeito para um underscore para evitar complicações com o nome do arquivo e garante que todos os nomes de arquivos gerados sejam válidos. Depois de ajustar esses detalhes, tente executar seu script apply_all_effects novamente e veja se o erro é resolvido ou mudou, o que pode fornecer pistas adicionais para a solução.

Option not found O erro “Option not found” está especificamente relacionado à aplicação do filtro aresample. Isso sugere que existe um problema com a maneira como o filtro está sendo chamado. A opção -r não é reconhecida como válida para o filtro aresample. Ao aplicar pitch shifting sem alteração na velocidade, a abordagem mais comum é alterar a taxa de amostragem para modificar o pitch e, em seguida, usar aresample para trazê-la de volta à taxa de amostragem original. No entanto, aresample não utiliza o parâmetro -r. A maneira correta de especificar a taxa de amostragem no aresample é usando a opção sample_rate. Aqui está como você pode corrigir o filtro: def apply_pitch_shift(input_file, output_file, pitch_rate=1.1): sample_rate = 44100 # taxa de amostragem original em Hz new_sample_rate = int(sample_rate * pitch_rate) # taxa de amostragem alterada para modificar o pitch command = [ ‘ffmpeg’, ‘-i’, input_file, ‘-filter_complex’, f’asetrate=r={new_sample_rate},aresample=sample_rate={sample_rate}', output_file ] subprocess.run(command, check=True) Corrigindo o filtro, a taxa de amostragem alterada é passada para asetrate e a taxa de amostragem original é corretamente restaurada no filtro aresample usando a opção sample_rate=. Adicionalmente, parece que o erro relacionado a ‘O identificador é inválido’ é gerado pelo Tkinter. Este tipo de erro pode ocorrer quando há uma tentativa de escrever em um widget após a janela do Tkinter ter sido fechada ou de outra forma invalidada. É um erro complexo que pode surgir devido à interação entre as threads ou as chamadas para processos externos que estão acontecendo enquanto a janela do Tkinter está aberta. Se você estiver usando Tkinter, certifique-se de que as operações envolvendo o ffmpeg não estejam interferindo com a interface do usuário do Tkinter. Uma forma de evitar tal conflito é executar as chamadas do ffmpeg em uma thread separada, ou garantir que todos os widgets e a janela principal do Tkinter estejam validamente abertos e acessíveis no momento em que você tenta escrever neles. Se você está usando Tkinter de maneira assíncrona junto com subprocessos, isso pode também ser a origem do problema, pois escrever nos stout/sterr assíncronos pode causar conflitos com o loop principal do Tkinter. Nessas situações, você pode tentar gerenciar melhor a concorrência ou assegurar que as saídas do subprocesso não estejam sendo diretamente utilizadas na thread principal do Tkinter. Não produz erro, mas a qualidade sonora é péssima e acho que não posso aproveitá-la para treino com o que este efeito produz A qualidade sonora ser percebida como “péssima” após a aplicação do efeito de pitch shifting pode ser devida a uma taxa de amostragem inadequada ou a um uso excessivo do efeito, que pode distorcer o áudio de maneira indesejável para o propósito do reconhecimento de voz. Quando aplicamos pitch shifting, estamos efetivamente alterando a altura do áudio sem mudar a duração. No entanto, fazer isso digitalmente pode introduzir artefatos de áudio, especialmente se a taxa de alteração for grande. A percepção de baixa qualidade também pode ser devido à geração de “aliasing” ou pela perda da fidelidade natural da voz humana, que pode ser particularmente sensível às alterações no espectro de frequência. Aqui estão algumas sugestões para tentar melhorar a qualidade do áudio após o pitch shifting: 1. Utilize taxas de alteração modestas Podias continuar","completion":"1. Utilize taxas de alteração modestas: Ao aplicar o pitch shifting, tente utilizar taxas de alteração mais modestas para minimizar os artefatos introduzidos. Muitas vezes, mudanças pequenas no pitch (como meio tom para cima ou para baixo) podem ser suficientes para a diversificação do treino sem causar distorções perceptíveis. 2. Software e algoritmos de alta qualidade: O uso de algoritmos de alta qualidade para pitch shifting pode melhorar a preservação da qualidade do áudio. Ferramentas como o SoX e plugins do Ardour ou outros DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations) muitas vezes oferecem opções melhores do que operações simples de mudança de taxa de amostragem. O ffmpeg pode não ser a ferramenta ideal para pitch shifting de alta qualidade. 3. Interpolação e processamento adicional: Ferramentas e bibliotecas que realizam interpolação de alta qualidade e aplicam processos adicionais para suavizar as mudanças podem resultar em áudios de melhor qualidade ao realizar pitch shifting. Filtros de preservação de forma de onda e eliminação de aliasing são úteis aqui. 4. Considere o contexto do uso: O propósito de aplicar efeitos sonoros é aumentar a robustez do seu algoritmo de reconhecimento de voz a diferentes condições. No entanto, efeitos excessivamente distorcidos podem não ser úteis para o treinamento. Deve-se procurar um equilíbrio entre a diversidade dos dados e a manutenção da utilidade prática e realismo do áudio. 5. Testes A/B: Compare o áudio processado com o original e use ouvidos treinados para determinar o quanto os efeitos estão degradando a qualidade. Ajustes finos nos parâmetros dos efeitos podem ser necessários para encontrar o ponto ideal. 6. Verificar a adequação para o modelo: Faça testes com o seu modelo de reconhecimento de voz para verificar se os áudios gerados com efeitos de pitch shifting são benéficos ou prejudiciais. A melhoria ou degradação no desempenho do modelo fornecerá feedback importante sobre a adequação do áudio para o treinamento. 7. Dados limpos vs dados augmentados: Inclua uma mistura de dados limpos e dados augmentados no seu conjunto de treinamento. Isto pode ajudar o modelo a generalizar melhor, ao invés de confiar apenas em dados que foram artificialmente alterados. 8. Escolha bibliotecas especializadas: Examine outras bibliotecas de processamento de áudio que são especializadas em manipulação de áudio e efeitos, como librosa em Python, que oferece funções integradas para pitch shifting com operações de preservação de tempo. Com essas práticas, você pode melhorar a qualidade do áudio após o pitch shifting e encontrar um compromisso benéfico entre a diversidade de dados e a qualidade auditiva para o treinamento eficaz do modelo de reconhecimento de voz."},{"prompt":"Utilize taxas de alteração modestas foi 0.9 e 1.1","completion":"Uma taxa de alteração de 0.9 (reduzindo o pitch em 10%) e 1.1 (aumentando o pitch em 10%) são, de fato, relativamente modestas. No entanto, se você ainda está percebendo uma perda significativa de qualidade, pode ser necessário ajustar como o pitch shifting é implementado ou considerar o uso de algoritmos diferentes que possam preservar melhor a qualidade do som original. Aqui estão algumas sugestões adicionais: 1. **Experimente algoritmos diferentes de pitch shifting**: Alguns algoritmos de pitch shifting, especialmente aqueles que utilizam a técnica de Phase Vocoder, podem preservar melhor a qualidade nos casos em que pequenas alterações são feitas. Librosa, por exemplo, possui a função \`librosa.effects.pitch_shift\`, que pode produzir resultados de qualidade superior em comparação ao simples ajuste de taxa de amostragem. 2. **Utilize o algoritmo de Rubber Band**: Se você escolher usar ferramentas de linha de comando como alternativas ao ffmpeg, o SoX suporta o uso do \`Rubber Band\`, um biblioteca para pitch shifting e time stretching que é conhecida por sua alta qualidade. 3. **Suavização**: Após o processamento, se o áudio estiver um pouco áspero ou metalizado, aplicar suavização pode ajudar. Isso pode ser feito com filtros de passa-baixa ou outros efeitos que minimizem sons estridentes. 4. **Controle de qualidade**: Além de testes automatizados e ouvido humano, visualize a forma de onda e o espectrograma do áudio para identificar distorções. Essa análise visual pode destacar problemas que não são imediatamente perceptíveis ao ouvido. 5. **Ajustes finos na aplicação de efeitos**: Talvez seja necessário reduzir ainda mais a taxa de alteração para menos de 10% ou usar valores intermediários para ver se há um ponto ideal em que a deterioração da qualidade é menos percebível. 6. **Testes e validação**: Realize testes com seu modelo de reconhecimento de voz para entender o impacto do pitch shifting. Considere validar os efeitos em um conjunto validação para verificar se o áudio ainda está útil para reconhecimento. 7. **Documentação dos resultados**: Mantenha um registro de como diferentes configurações e técnicas afetam a qualidade do som. Isso pode ajudar a estabelecer as melhores práticas para a sua aplicação específica. 8. **Valide o processamento no ffmpeg**: Certifique-se de que as opções do filtergraph estejam corretas e verifique se a implementação do efeito está alinhada com as melhores práticas (por exemplo, preservar a transparência do áudio, garantir que a conversão de taxa de bits esteja adequada, entre outros). 9. **Avalie diferentes ferramentas**: Se possível, compare os resultados entre diferentes ferramentas de manipulação de áudio para encontrar aquela que oferece os melhores resultados para o seu caso. Se a qualidade ainda for inaceitável mesmo depois de tentar essas sugestões, pode ser necessário reavaliar o uso do pitch shifting como técnica de data augmentation para o seu modelo de reconhecimento de voz, ou explorar outras formas de diversificar seu conjunto de dados que não dependam tão fortemente de alterações nos atributos acústicos do áudio original."},{"prompt":"Exception has occurred: OSError (note: full exception trace is shown but execution is paused at: _run_module_as_main) [WinError 6] O identificador é inválido File \\"C:UsersvaniaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython38Libtkinter__init__.py\\", line 1883, in __call__ return self.func(*args) File \\"C:meucomparar1arquivocomoutrosreorganizado_MFCCs_parametros.py\\", line 3302, in apply_all_effects apply_speaker_distance(input_file, output_file, volume, reverb_params) File \\"C:meucomparar1arquivocomoutrosreorganizado_MFCCs_parametros.py\\", line 2691, in apply_speaker_distance subprocess.run(command, check=True) File \\"C:UsersvaniaAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython38Libsubprocess.py\\", line 512, in run raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args, subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['ffmpeg', '-i', 'c:meupara_fazer_augmentationcommand_quatro_1702262103_1.wav', '-af', 'volume=0.5,aecho=50:50:60:0.5:0.5:5', 'c:meuresultado_augmentationcommand_quatro_1702262103_1_0,5_speakerdist.wav']' returned non-zero exit status 1.

You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong.

Yuri: \\"You're doing great, Natsuki. Just a little more.\\" Monika: \\"Stay focused, Natsuki. You're almost there. Just a few more pushes.\\" Sayori: \\"We're so proud of you, Natsuki.

MC: \\"The baby's head is out! We can see it!\\" Operator: \\"Good job, sir.

Sayori: \\"You're almost there, Natsuki! Just one more push!\\" Natsuki: (taking a deep breath) \\"Okay, here it goes!\\" (With one final push, Natsuki gives it her all, and a cry fills the room as Sakura is born.) Monika: (teary-eyed) \\"Congratulations, Natsuki! You did it! Sakura is here!\\" Yuri: \\"She's beautiful, Natsuki. You did an amazing job.\\" Sayori: \\"Welcome to the world, Sakura! You have a wonderful mommy.\\" Natsuki: (exhausted but joyful) \\"I did it… Sakura, my little miracle.

And in that moment, they realize that their literature club has grown into something even more extraordinary - a family.) (With the ambulance finally arriving, Natsuki and Sakura are carefully transferred to the hospital for further care and observation. And though they faced an unexpected and challenging journey, the bonds formed within the literature club only grew deeper, as they celebrated the resilience, courage, and love that carried them through.)"},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “","completion":"She's coming... She's coming now!” (Suddenly, the room is filled with panic as the club members scramble to gather towels and pillows to assist Natsuki through an unexpected home birth.) Sayori: “Okay, Natsuki, we need to get you in a comfortable position. Can you try lying down on the floor?” Natsuki: (clutching her stomach) “I’ll try… Just help me down.” (MC and Yuri carefully support Natsuki as she lowers herself onto the floor. Monika quickly sets up a makeshift birthing space, placing towels and pillows underneath Natsuki.) MC: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll do everything we can to help you.” Yuri: “Let’s make sure you’re as comfortable as possible and that Sakura arrives safely.” Sayori: “Natsuki, remember to breathe through each contraction. We’ll guide you, okay?” (Natsuki nods, taking deep breaths as the contractions grow stronger. With each wave of pain, the club members offer words of encouragement and support.) Monika: “You’re doing great, Natsuki. Just keep breathing and stay focused.” MC: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’ve got this.” Yuri: “You’re so strong, Natsuki. I’m in awe of your bravery.” Sayori: “Just imagine holding Sakura in your arms. It’s motivation to keep going.” (Natsuki pushes through the pain, encouraged by the unwavering support of her friends. The club room becomes a chorus of reassurance and determination.) Natsuki: “I can do this… I can do this for Sakura.” MC: “We believe in you, Natsuki. You’re so close.” Sayori: “Just a little bit longer, Natsuki. You're almost there.” Yuri: “Stay focused and keep pushing, Natsuki. We’re right here with you.” Monika: “You are incredible, Natsuki. Keep going, Sakura is right around the corner.” (With one final push, Natsuki’s intense efforts culminate in a momentous cry that fills the room. The sounds of a newborn baby echo through the clubroom.) MC: “Natsuki… You did it. You brought Sakura into the world.” Natsuki: (tears of joy streaming down her face) “Is she… Is she okay?” Sayori: (sobbing) “She’s perfect, Natsuki. Just perfect.” (Yuri carefully places the newborn baby on Natsuki’s chest, wrapping them in a warm blanket while Monika grabs a nearby phone to call the ambulance and inform them of the successful birth.) Monika: (on the phone) “Hello, this is Monika from the literature club. We just had an unexpected home birth. Both the mother and baby are doing well, but we still need medical assistance to ensure their safety.” Operator: “Understood, Monika. Paramedics are on their way. Please make sure to keep the baby warm and comfortable. Congratulations on the birth.” Monika: “Thank you. We’ll wait here for the paramedics.” (The club members surround Natsuki and Sakura, overwhelmed with joy and relief. The clubroom is filled with an aura of love and celebration.) MC: “Natsuki, you were absolutely incredible. You brought Sakura into the world with such strength and determination.” Natsuki: (gently cradling Sakura) “Thank you, MC. I couldn’t have done it without all of you. I’m just so grateful.” Sayori: “Sakura is the luckiest baby to have you as her mom, Natsuki. You did an amazing job.” Yuri: “Your bravery and resilience are truly inspiring, Natsuki. Sakura is already so fortunate to have you.” Monika: “This unexpected journey brought us closer together, Natsuki. You’ve shown us what it means to be strong and fearless. Sakura is a lucky girl.” (As they continue to wait for the ambulance, the club members revel in the beauty and miracle of new life. Together, they embrace this unexpected adventure and pledge to support and love Natsuki and Sakura through every step of their journey.)"},{"prompt":"Is it possible for twins who were born 40 minutes apart were born in different years?","completion":"Yes, it is possible for twins born 40 minutes apart to be born in different years if the first twin is born shortly before midnight on December 31st, and the second twin is born shortly after midnight on January 1st. This rare situation would result in the twins having different birth years, despite being born only minutes apart. For example, one could be born at 11:59 PM on December 31, 2022, and the other at 12:39 AM on January 1, 2023. Such an occurrence would make for an interesting story and could result in the twins celebrating their birthdays on different days and even getting to joke about being born in different years despite being twins."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Sayori: “MC, can you PLEASE watch where you’re going next time?! You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon.

We’ll have to work quickly and do the best we can.” (MC and Sayori lay towels on the floor, creating a makeshift birthing area. Yuri and Monika position themselves on either side of Natsuki, ready to assist with the delivery.) Monika: “Natsuki, when the next contraction comes, you need to push with all your strength.

Keep pushing!” (With one final push, Sakura emerges, crying softly, and Monika gently supports her head while Yuri works quickly to remove any fluids obstructing her airway.) Yuri: “She’s here! We did it! Natsuki, you did it!” Natsuki: (exhausted, tears of joy streaming down her face) “Thank you… Thank you so much…” (MC quickly wraps Sakura in warm towels and places her in Natsuki’s trembling arms.)

You’re a wonderful mom.” Yuri: “You’re a true example of strength and resilience, Natsuki. Sakura is lucky to have you.” Monika: “Welcome to the world, Sakura. You’re surrounded by so much love already.” (Natsuki holds Sakura close, her tears of pain replaced with tears of joy.) Natsuki: (whispering to Sakura) “You’re finally here, my little angel. I love you more than anything in the world. Welcome to our family.” (The club members share in the moment, in awe of the miracle they just witnessed. They may not have been prepared for the unexpected birth, but they couldn’t be happier to welcome Sakura into their lives.) (Several minutes later, they hear the sound of sirens approaching.) Yuri: “The ambulance is here. They can take care of Natsuki now.” MC: (calling out) “Over here! We just delivered a baby!” (The paramedics rush into the clubroom, their eyes widening in surprise.) Paramedic: “You delivered a baby? You all did an amazing job. We’ll take it from here.” (Medical professionals quickly take over, attending to Natsuki and Sakura, ensuring their health and safety. The club members step back, letting the experts do their work.) MC: (watching with relief) “She’s in good hands now. I’m so grateful everything turned out okay.” Sayori: (wiping away tears) “It’s truly a miracle. Sakura’s arrival was unexpected, but she’s a perfect little miracle.” Yuri: “Natsuki’s strength and determination brought us all together in such an incredible way. I feel honored to have been a part of this experience.” Monika: “This club is more than just literature.

Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “She’s coming…she’s coming now! I can’t hold it back!”","completion":"Sayori: (frantically) \\"What do we do?!\\" Yuri: \\"Stay calm, everyone.

You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom.

Yuri: “Okay, listen carefully, everyone. We need to do our best to support Natsuki through this. Monika, go grab some blankets and towels. Sayori, call the ambulance back and update them on the situation. MC, help me guide Natsuki to lie down on the floor. We’ll do our best to assist with the delivery until professionals arrive.” (Monika quickly rushes out of the clubroom to gather supplies, while Sayori quickly dials the emergency line once more.) Monika: (returning with a pile of towels and blankets) “Here, take these. Lay them on the floor for Natsuki to lie on. We need to make sure she's as comfortable as possible.” MC and Yuri gently help Natsuki lie down on the makeshift bed on the floor. Natsuki's breathing is heavy and erratic, and her grip on their hands is tight. Sayori: (on the phone) “Hello, this is an update on the situation. Natsuki couldn’t hold it any longer and is currently in active labor. The baby is coming, and we need assistance immediately.” Operator: “Okay, we understand. We’re sending an ambulance over right away. In the meantime, do your best to keep Natsuki as comfortable as possible, and if there are any signs of distress, don’t hesitate to let us know.” Natsuki: (crying) “It hurts so much! I can't do this!” Yuri: “Yes, you can, Natsuki. You're so strong, and we're right here with you. Just keep breathing and pushing when you feel the urge. Everything will be alright.” While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, the club members do their best to support and guide Natsuki through her contractions and the process of giving birth. Monika: “Natsuki, focus on your breathing. Take deep breaths in and push when you feel the need. We're here to help you every step of the way.” MC: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki. Just a little more, and Sakura will be in your arms. We're so proud of you.” Sayori: “Natsuki, remember what we talked about when Sakura’s birth is near? Visualize her little face and the joy she'll bring. Stay focused, and it will be over soon.” (Yuri carefully guides Natsuki through the pushing motions, offering words of encouragement and gentle support.) Yuri: “Natsuki, you're doing incredibly well. Just a little more, and Sakura will be here. Push with all your might.” Natsuki: (screaming) “I can't… I can't anymore, it hurts too much!” MC: “Natsuki, you can do this! You're so close. Just a few more pushes, and we'll meet Sakura together.” Monika: “Natsuki, remember your strength. We believe in you. Push harder, and we'll be able to welcome Sakura into this world.” (Suddenly, the sound of sirens fills the air as the ambulance arrives.) Paramedic: (rushing into the clubroom) “We received the update. How is the mother doing?” MC: “She’s in active labor and has been pushing for a while now.” Paramedic: “Alright, we’ll take it from here. Make way, please.” (The paramedics take over and assist Natsuki through the final stages of labor and delivery. The club members step back, their hearts racing with anticipation and relief.) Paramedic: (holding the tiny, fragile baby in their arms) “Congratulations, it’s a girl.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “My baby… Sakura.” (Sakura lets out a loud, healthy cry, filling the room with a sense of joy and relief.) Yuri: (wiping away her tears) “She’s beautiful, Natsuki. Congratulations.” Monika: “Natsuki, you did an amazing job. We're so proud of you.” Natsuki: (emotionally overwhelmed) “Thank you all… for being here for me. I couldn’t have done it without you.” MC: “We're here for you and Sakura. Always.” (The club members gather around Natsuki and Sakura, sharing in the special moment and marveling at the newest addition to their literature family.) (From that point on, the clubroom would always hold a special place in Natsuki’s heart, reminding her of the incredible support and love she received from her friends during one of the toughest moments of her life.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Sayori: “MC, can you PLEASE watch where you’re going next time?! You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “I CAN’T","completion":"HOLD IT ANYMORE! SHE'S COMING!” (MC quickly grabs a blanket and cushions, preparing for the unexpected birth. The other club members hurry to assist.) Sayori: “We need to get you on the floor, Natsuki. It will be more comfortable for you.” Yuri: “And we need to make sure Sakura has a safe and clean environment to be born in.” (MC and Yuri carefully help Natsuki to the floor, positioning the cushions to support her.) Monika: “Okay, Natsuki, we need you to try to push with the contractions. Just bear down and breathe.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tightly, her face flushed with both pain and determination.) Natsuki: “I can do this… for Sakura…” Sayori: “That’s it, Natsuki! Just keep pushing, and we’ll support you every step of the way.” (MC quickly gathers towels and any clean materials available to keep Sakura warm and wipe her clean.) Yuri: “She’s coming, Natsuki! Just a little more!” (Natsuki pushes with all her strength, feeling a mix of pain and relief as Sakura begins to make her way into the world.) Natsuki: “I can see her head! Oh, Sakura, you’re almost here!” Monika: “Just a few more pushes, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing!” (Natsuki pushes once more, and with a final cry, Sakura is born into the world. The room is filled with a mix of joy and relief.) MC: “She’s here! Natsuki, you did it!” (Natsuki collapses back onto the cushion, gasping for breath, while the club members gently clean and wrap Sakura in the towels.) Sayori: “Congratulations, Natsuki! You did such a great job!” Yuri: “Sakura is absolutely beautiful, Natsuki. You should be so proud.” Monika: “You’re a strong and amazing mother, Natsuki. Sakura is lucky to have you.” (Natsuki, her eyes filled with tears, reaches out to hold her newborn daughter for the first time.) Natsuki: “Sakura… my sweet baby girl. You’re finally here. Mommy loves you so much.” (Sakura’s tiny hand grasps her mother’s finger, and in that moment, all the pain and struggle fades away, leaving only love and a bright future ahead.) (Meanwhile, the sound of sirens draws closer as the ambulance arrives, finding Natsuki and Sakura safe and sound.) Paramedic: “Congratulations! Looks like you did an incredible job, Natsuki. We’ll take you to the hospital just to make sure everything is okay.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Thank you, but we’re both fine. Sakura couldn’t wait for the ambulance, so she decided to come early.” (The paramedics assist Natsuki into the ambulance, carefully ensuring Sakura is bundled up and safe.) Paramedic: “Well, it seems like she couldn’t wait to meet all of you. We’ll make sure you’re both checked out and taken care of at the hospital.” MC: “Thank you so much. We appreciate your help.” (With Natsuki and Sakura safely on their way to the hospital, the club members take a moment to catch their breath and reflect on the miraculous event that just took place.) Monika: “I can’t believe we delivered a baby in the clubroom. This will definitely be a story to remember.” Sayori: “It was so scary, but everything turned out okay in the end. I’m just glad Natsuki and Sakura are safe.” Yuri: “Childbirth is truly a marvel. Natsuki showed incredible strength and bravery throughout the entire process.” MC: “I couldn’t be prouder of Natsuki. She really is an amazing mother. And Sakura… she’s a little fighter, just like her mom.” (With hearts full of joy and gratitude, the club members tidy up the clubroom and make their way to the hospital, eager to support Natsuki and welcome Sakura into their literary family.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Sayori: “MC, can you PLEASE watch where you’re going next time?!

I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “I CAN’T HOLD IT ANYMORE!!!” Sayori: (to Yuri) “Does she mean…?”","completion":"Yuri: \\"Yes, it seems like Natsuki couldn't resist the urge to push any longer.

Just keep a close eye on her and be ready for when Sakura begins to crown. Remember, patience and carefulness are key.\\" (After what feels like an eternity, the moment arrives.

Keep pushing gently, and Sakura will be in your arms soon.\\" Yuri: \\"Make sure to support the baby's head as it emerges.

You're a mommy now.\\" Natsuki: (whispering) \\"My little Sakura...thank you all for being here with me.\\" (The sound of an ambulance siren becomes audible in the distance.) MC: \\"The ambulance is here, Natsuki. They'll take care of you both now.\\" Yuri: \\"Congratulations, Natsuki. We're so proud of you.\\" Monika: \\"You've shown incredible strength and courage, Natsuki. Sakura is lucky to have you as a mother.\\" (Sirens grow louder, and the paramedics rush into the clubroom to assist Natsuki and the newborn baby.) Paramedic: \\"We received a call about a birth. Is everyone okay?\\" Sayori: \\"Yes, the baby is already born. Natsuki did an amazing job.\\" Paramedic: \\"We'll need to assess their condition and ensure they're stable. Thank you for assisting.\\" (MC, Sayori, Yuri, and Monika step back to give room to the paramedics. The clubroom, once filled with literature activities, now serves as an unexpected birthing room.) MC: \\"Natsuki, we'll be right here waiting for you. Take care of Sakura.\\" Natsuki: (smiling weakly) \\"Thank you all...so much.\\" (As the paramedics check on Natsuki and Sakura, the club members watch with a mix of awe and relief. They realize that even in unexpected circumstances, their bond as a literature club family remains unbreakable.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Sayori: “MC, can you PLEASE watch where you’re going next time?! You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “I CAN’T HOLD IT ANYMORE!!!” Sayori: (to Yuri) “Does she mean…?”","completion":"Yuri: (nervously) \\"I think she's pushing... The baby might be coming...\\" MC: (frantically) \\"What do we do? We can't deliver a baby on our own!\\" Monika: \\"We need to keep Natsuki calm and comfortable. Let's support her and do our best until help arrives.\\" (Yuri quickly grabs some clean towels and blankets from the nearby shelves while Monika helps Natsuki into a more comfortable position.) Natsuki: (breathing heavily) \\"Oh god, it hurts so much...\\" Sayori: \\"Just keep pushing, Natsuki. We're here for you. Remember to breathe and stay as relaxed as possible.\\" (Yuri prepares the towels and blankets, doing her best to create a makeshift delivery area.) MC: (panicking) \\"What if something goes wrong? We don't have any medical experience!\\" Monika: \\"We'll do our best, MC. It's an emergency situation, and we have to rely on our instincts and support Natsuki.\\" (Natsuki continues to push, her pain evident, but determination shining in her eyes.) Yuri: \\"I can see the baby's head! Natsuki, you're doing amazing. Keep pushing!\\" Natsuki: (gasping) \\"I-I can't... I can't-\\" Sayori: \\"Yes, you can, Natsuki! We believe in you. Just a little more, and we'll meet your beautiful baby.\\" (Natsuki gathers her strength and pushes with all her might, and after a few more intense moments, a cry fills the air.) MC: (teary-eyed) \\"The baby... It's here!\\" Monika: (relieved) \\"Well done, Natsuki. You did it! You've given birth to your baby.\\" (Yuri quickly wraps the newborn in a clean towel and places it on Natsuki's chest.) Natsuki: (exhausted) \\"Is... Is the baby okay?\\" Monika: \\"Let's check. We need to make sure the baby is breathing properly.\\" (The club members anxiously wait for signs of movement and hear the tiny cries of the newborn.) Yuri: \\"The baby is breathing, and everything seems fine. We did it!\\" Sayori: \\"Congratulations, Natsuki! You're a mom now.\\" Natsuki: (tearfully) \\"Thank you all. I couldn't have done it without your support.\\" MC: \\"We're so proud of you, Natsuki. You were incredible.\\" (Moments later, the sound of sirens fills the room as the ambulance finally arrives.) Paramedic: \\"We received a call about a premature labor. Is everything alright?\\" Monika: \\"Yes, the baby is here, and both Natsuki and the baby seem to be doing fine.\\" Paramedic: \\"That's great news. Let us take over from here and make sure everyone is healthy.\\" (The paramedics take over, providing medical care to Natsuki and the newborn. The club members step back, emotional and overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events.) Sayori: \\"I can't believe we just helped deliver a baby...\\" Yuri: \\"It was intense, but we did what we had to in an emergency situation.\\" MC: \\"We truly showed how much we care for each other. This experience brought us even closer together.\\" Monika: \\"We'll always be here to support one another, no matter what.\\" (Soon after, Natsuki and the baby are safely transported to the hospital, with the club members following behind.) (Months later, the literature club gathers in the hospital room, where Natsuki holds her healthy baby girl, Sakura.) Natsuki: (smiling) \\"I can't thank you all enough for being there for me during the birth. You're like a second family to us.\\" Sayori: \\"We wouldn't have missed it for the world, Natsuki. Sakura is such a beautiful baby.\\" MC: \\"We're honored to have been a part of this journey with you, Natsuki. You've shown incredible resilience and strength.\\" Yuri: \\"I'm so glad everything turned out well. It was a truly unforgettable experience.\\" Monika: \\"Sakura is lucky to have such a loving mother and this incredible circle of friends. We'll always be here to support you both.\\" (Natsuki smiles, feeling immense gratitude for her newfound family.) Natsuki: \\"Thank you all for everything. We couldn't have done it without you. Sakura is so lucky to have you as her literary family.\\" (Sakura yawns and coos, as if agreeing with her mother's sentiment.) (Surrounded by love and support, Natsuki begins her journey as a mother, cherishing each moment with her precious daughter and her beloved literature club.)"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Sayori: “MC, can you PLEASE watch where you’re going next time?!

Contrairement aux cellules photovoltaïques traditionnelles à base de silicium, les OPVs sont fabriquées avec de matériaux organiques – des polymères ou de petites molécules organiques – qui présentent l'avantage d'être légers, flexibles, et potentiellement moins onéreux à produire [1]. Principe de Fonctionnement Le principe de fonctionnement des cellules organiques est similaire à celui des cellules en silicium. La lumière incidente est absorbée par la couche organique active, résultant en la formation d'excitons (paires électron-trou). Ces excitons sont dissociés aux interfaces entre différents matériaux organiques pour former des charges libres qui sont ensuite collectées par les électrodes [2]. Avantages et Limitations Le principal avantage des OPVs est leur flexibilité et la simplicité de leur processus de fabrication, qui peut inclure l'impression par jet d'encre ou par revêtement en rouleau (roll-to-roll coating). Ils peuvent aussi être transparents ou colorés, ce qui les rend attrayants pour des applications architecturales [3]. Néanmoins, les OPVs font face à des défis importants, notamment leur stabilité à long terme et leur efficacité de conversion énergétique plus faible par rapport aux technologies plus établies. Développements Récents La recherche récente dans le domaine des OPVs se concentre sur l'amélioration de l'efficacité et de la durée de vie des cellules. Les avancées incluent le développement de nouveaux matériaux, tels que les accepteurs non fullerènes, qui offrent une meilleure stabilité et l'augmentation des potentiels de tension open-circuit [4]. De plus, l'intégration de couches interfaciales optimisées et l'ingénierie morphologique de la couche active contribuent aussi à ces améliorations. Perspectives et Applications Les OPVs ont un potentiel significatif pour diverses applications, comme les bâtiments intégrés à l'énergie photovoltaïque (BIPV), les dispositifs portables et l'électronique imprimée [5]. Leur développement continu offre la promesse d'une énergie solaire plus accessible et personnalisable. # Références 1.

These materials offer advantages such as lightweight, flexibility, and the potential for low-cost production through solution-based processes [1]. Operating Principle The operational principle of OPVs is based on the photoelectric effect similar to that in conventional solar cells. Upon light absorption, the organic semiconductors generate excitons, which are pairs of electrons and holes. These are then split into free charges at the donor-acceptor interface and transported to the respective electrodes to generate electric current [2]. Advantages and Challenges OPVs offer several advantages, including their mechanical flexibility, potential for transparent devices, and compatibility with large-area and roll-to-roll production techniques. However, they face challenges such as lower power conversion efficiencies compared to inorganic alternatives and limited stability and lifetime under operation conditions [3]. Recent Developments Recent research has focused on designing new materials with enhanced light absorption and stability, optimizing multi-junction architectures for higher efficiency, and developing better interfacial layers for charge collection. Non-fullerene acceptors, tandem structures, and morphological engineering have shown tremendous potential to improve OPV performance [4][5]. Future Perspectives OPVs are promising for applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), lightweight portable energy devices, and wearable electronics. Advances in materials science and device engineering are expected to enhance the efficiency and operational stability of OPVs, which could accelerate their commercialization and impact on the renewable energy sector [6]. # References 1.

You almost knocked over Natsuki!” MC: “Ah, sorry Sayori, I wasn’t paying attention. Are you two okay?” Natsuki: “Yeah, we’re fine. Just be more careful next time, alright?” (Natsuki puts her hands on her belly.) Natsuki: “Sakura could’ve died, you know?! And I’m only in the seventh month!” MC: “I-I’m really sorry, Natsuki! I didn’t realize Sakura was in any danger. I promise to be more careful from now on. Is there anything I can do to help?” Sayori: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. MC didn’t mean any harm. Accidents happen, but we need to make sure everyone’s safe.” (speaking to Natsuki’s belly) “Are you feeling okay, Sakura?” Natsuki: “She’s fine, Sayori. No need to worry. Just a little scare, that’s all.” Sayori: “Phew, that’s a relief. We should all be more cautious, especially around Natsuki. Pregnancy can be delicate, after all.” MC: “You’re right, Sayori. I didn’t realize how easily accidents can happen. I’ll make sure to watch my steps around Natsuki and everyone else.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I appreciate your concern, even if it was a close call. Just remember, Sakura’s good now, but we should all be mindful of each other’s well-being.” MC: “Absolutely, Natsuki. I’ll do my best to create a safe environment for everyone in the literature club.” Sayori: “That’s the spirit, MC! We’re all here to support and take care of each other.” Natsuki: “And Sakura, of course. She’s going to have an amazing club to grow up in.” MC: “Let’s make sure of it, Natsuki. We’ll be the best literary family we can be.” Sayori: “I think Sakura will be proud to have us.” (With a newfound understanding and commitment to each other’s safety, the club members continue their activities, ensuring that accidents are avoided and everyone’s well-being is prioritized.) (That evening, after the club meeting…) Natsuki: (caressing her belly, lying in bed) “I’m glad everything turned out okay today, Sakura. But now, Mommy needs some rest. Goodnight, my little angel. Sweet dreams.” (Sakura kicks gently, as if responding to her mother’s voice.) Natsuki: (smiling) “You’re already so active, huh? Just like your dad. It’s such a shame he won’t be in your life. But for now, it’s just you and me, Sakura. We’ll make sure to fill your life with love and happiness. Goodnight, my sweet baby. I love you. Can’t wait to meet you in two more months.” (Natsuki closes her eyes, feeling a sense of peace and contentment as she drifts off to sleep, dreaming of the future and the beautiful moments that await her and her unborn child - unaware that the birth would happen sooner than planned.) (The next day, back in the clubroom…) MC: “Hey Natsuki, how are you feeling today?” Natsuki: “I’m feeling great, MC. No worries! Sakura seems to be active as ever.” Sayori: “That’s good to hear, Natsuki. But we should still be careful. Maybe we should rearrange the clubroom a bit to create more space?” MC: “That’s a good idea, Sayori. Let’s make sure there’s plenty of room to move around safely.” (Together, the club members start clearing some space in the clubroom. They move the desks and chairs to the sides, creating a larger open area in the middle.) Natsuki: “This feels much better already. Now there’s less chance of accidents happening.” MC: “Definitely. Safety should always come first, especially for Natsuki and Sakura.” Sayori: “Now we can enjoy our literature activities without worrying too much. Let’s make the most of this.” (As they continue with their club activities, they are more cautious and aware of their surroundings. They keep an eye on Natsuki, ensuring her comfort and safety. However, at that moment, a sudden pain shoots through Natsuki’s abdomen, causing her to grip the edge of the desk for support.) Natsuki: (grimacing) “Ugh, what was that?” MC: “Natsuki, are you okay? Should I call for help?” Natsuki: (taking deep breaths) “I…I think…I’m having contractions.” Sayori: (panicking) “Oh no, what do we do?! Is it time?!” Natsuki: (trying to remain calm) “I…I think so. But it’s still too early. Sakura isn’t due for another two months!” MC: (grabbing his phone) “I’ll call an ambulance right away. Hang in there, Natsuki.” (As MC dials for an ambulance, the club members gather around Natsuki, offering words of encouragement and support.) MC: (on the phone) “Hello, we have an emergency! One of our club members, Natsuki, is experiencing premature labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Operator: “Stay calm, sir. Help is on the way. Is Natsuki conscious and breathing?” MC: “Yes, she’s conscious and breathing, but in a lot of pain.” Operator: “Try to keep her as comfortable as possible. The ambulance will be there as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with?” MC: “No, just please hurry. Thank you.” (As they wait for the ambulance, Sayori rubs Natsuki’s back gently, offering words of comfort. But just as Natsuki goes into active labor, the other two club members enter the room.) Yuri: “What’s happening? Is Natsuki okay?” Monika: “I heard MC on the phone talking about an ambulance. What’s going on?” Sayori: “Natsuki’s in active premature labor. Sakura’s coming, and it’s too early.” Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, that’s not good. We need to stay calm and support Natsuki through this.” Monika: “Absolutely, we need to be there for her. Is there anything we can do to help?” MC: (still on the phone) “The ambulance is on its way. Let’s just make sure Natsuki is as comfortable as possible until they arrive.” Sayori: “Natsuki, just breathe and focus on getting through each contraction. We’re all here for you.” Natsuki: (in pain) “I-I’ll try. Just…just stay with me.” (Yuri helps Natsuki to sit down on a nearby cushioned chair, while Monika grabs a blanket to drape around her shoulders.) Yuri: “Are you feeling any better with the support?” Natsuki: (squeezing Sayori’s hand) “A little. Thank you, guys. I…I don’t know what I would do without you.” Monika: “You don’t have to worry about that, Natsuki. We’re here for you, no matter what.” MC: (ending the call) “The ambulance will be here soon. Just hold on a little longer, Natsuki.” (As the minutes pass, the contractions intensify and Natsuki’s pain increases. But just minutes later, Natsuki’s water breaks.) Natsuki: (gasping) “Oh gosh, my water just broke!” Monika: “That means Sakura is coming soon, Natsuki. Just stay strong and let the ambulance team take care of you.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re doing amazing.” Yuri: “Try to focus on your breathing, Natsuki. Deep breaths, just like we practiced.” MC: “Hang in there, Natsuki. The ambulance should be here any minute.” (Natsuki grips Sayori’s hand tighter, taking deep breaths to manage the pain. The club members continue to offer support and encouragement.) Natsuki: (panting heavily) “It hurts so much, but I have to stay strong for Sakura…for my baby.” Sayori: “You’re doing incredible, Natsuki! Just a little bit longer, and you’ll get to meet Sakura.” Monika: “Remember, Natsuki, your strength and determination will get you through this. We’re all here supporting you.” Yuri: “You’ve got this, Natsuki. We have full faith in your abilities. Just keep breathing and focusing on the end goal.” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a little bit longer, and you’ll have professional help. Hold off on pushing for now.” Natsuki: “I’ll try my best, MC, but…the urge is getting stronger. I don’t know if I can hold it back much longer.” Sayori: “Natsuki, listen to me. It’s too dangerous if you try to push right now. We need to wait for the professionals to arrive. Just hang on a little longer, okay?” (Natsuki nods, trying her best to resist the urge to push. However, as her contractions continue to intensify, the urge becomes stronger.) Natsuki: (struggling) “I don’t know if I can…it’s too much!” Monika: “Stay strong, Natsuki. We’re here for you. Just a little longer, and help will be here.” Yuri: “Remember the breathing techniques, Natsuki. Focus on that and try to resist the urge to push.” Natsuki: “I’m trying, Yuri, but it’s getting harder! The contractions are so intense!” MC: “The ambulance is almost here, Natsuki. Just a few more minutes, and they’ll be able to help you through this.” (Natsuki takes deep breaths, her face contorted with pain. The minutes feel like an eternity as the urge to push becomes nearly unbearable. But as the evening arrives, Natsuki gives into the urge to push.) Natsuki: “I-I-I need to push! I can’t hold it back anymore!” Sayori: “Natsuki, we need to wait for the ambulance. It’s not safe to push on your own.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “I can’t…I can’t fight it anymore! Sakura NEEDS to come out!” MC: “Natsuki, we understand how difficult it is, but we have to prioritize your safety and Sakura’s. Just a little longer, and the professionals will be here to help.” Yuri: “Natsuki, please try to hold on. It’s crucial that you don’t push until the ambulance arrives.” (Natsuki grits her teeth, a mix of determination and pain on her face. The club members hold her hands tightly and provide words of encouragement as they await the arrival of the ambulance.) MC: “Any minute now, Natsuki. Just stay strong.” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I can’t…I can’t hold it anymore. It hurts too much.” Monika: “Natsuki, I know it’s incredibly difficult, but please trust us. We have to do what’s safest for both you and Sakura. The ambulance will be here soon.” Sayori: “Remember, Natsuki, you’re strong. We’re all with you, and we’ll support you until the-” (Natsuki suddenly cries out in pain - a clear sign that Sakura wasn’t waiting for the ambulance.) MC: “Oh no! Natsuki, are you okay?” Natsuki: “I CAN’T HOLD IT ANYMORE!!!” Sayori: (to Yuri) “Does she mean…?” Yuri: (nervously) “I think she’s pushing…Sakura might be coming…” (The club members scramble into action, doing their best to support Natsuki through this unexpected delivery.) MC: “Okay, Natsuki, just focus on your breathing and push when you need to. We’ll be right here with you.” Monika: “I’m going to call the ambulance back and let them know what’s happening. They might be able to give us some guidance over the phone.” (Sayori grabs towels and blankets, preparing them to help deliver baby Sakura.) Sayori: “We’re going to do our best, Natsuki. Just keep pushing, and we’ll make sure Sakura arrives safely.” Natuki: (grunting with effort) “I’m trying, I really am!” (Yuri supports Natsuki’s back, helping her find a comfortable position to push.) Yuri: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki. Just a little more, and Sakura will be here.” (Meanwhile, Monika manages to get in touch with the emergency dispatcher.) Monika: “Hello, this is Monika from the literature club. I need immediate assistance! One of our members is giving birth right now!” Dispatcher: “I’m sorry for the delay, but please stay with her until we can arrive. Is there anyone there with medical training?” Monika: “No, we don’t have anyone with medical training, but we’re doing our best to support her. Can you guide us through the process?” Dispatcher: “I’ll do my best. Is the baby’s head visible?” Natsuki: (gasping) “Yes! I can see it!” Dispatcher: “Okay, Natsuki, listen carefully. You need to continue pushing with each contraction, but do it gently to avoid tearing. Support the baby’s head as it emerges. Keep going until the rest of the body comes out.” (Natsuki follows the dispatcher’s instructions, pushing with all her strength. The club members cheer her on.) Sayori: “Great job, Natsuki! You’re almost there!” Yuri: “You’re so brave, Natsuki. We’re all here for you.” MC: “Just a little more, Natsuki. Keep going!” (With one final push, Sakura makes her entrance into the world, crying loudly.) Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “Sakura…she’s here…I did it!” MC: (teary-eyed) “You did amazing, Natsuki. We’re all so proud of you.” (Sayori quickly wraps the baby in a warm blanket and places Sakura in Natsuki’s arms.) Sayori: “Meet your beautiful daughter, Natsuki. She’s perfect.” Natsuki: (overwhelmed with emotion) “Sakura…my little miracle…you’re finally here…”","completion":"(Meanwhile, sirens blare outside as the ambulance arrives at the school.

Delta-V: 2.988*10^7 m/s (0.10c) Wet Mass: 45,000 metric tons Dry Mass: 3,000 metric tons Mass Ration: 15.0 Payload: 150 metric tons Specific Impulse: 1,000,000 seconds Thrust: 855,000 Newtons Acceleration: 0.019 m/s^2 (0.002 g) Acceleration time: 25 Earth years Coast time: 70 Earth Years Deceleration time: 5 Earth years Length: 10,000 meters","completion":"Given the parameters you provided, we can calculate how long it takes for the spacecraft to accelerate to relativistic velocity. It's not clear from your question whether you want to count the acceleration time as the sole period or whether you are looking to achieve 10% the speed of light (0.1c) within this period. To clarify: - Acceleration time provided is 25 Earth years. - The provided acceleration is 0.019 m/s^2. If you're just asking how long to reach 0.1c (which is 2.988 x 10^7 m/s) at the given acceleration rate and not including the coast and deceleration times, we use the basic kinematic equation: v = a * t Where: v = final velocity (2.988 x 10^7 m/s) a = acceleration (0.019 m/s^2) t = time (in seconds) Rearrange the equation to solve for time (t): t = v / a t = (2.988 x 10^7 m/s) / (0.019 m/s^2) t ~= 1.5726315789473684 x 10^9 s Now, we convert this time into years: t (years) = t (seconds) / (60 s/min * 60 min/hour * 24 hour/day * ~365.25 day/year) t (years) = 1.5726315789473684 x 10^9 s / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25) t (years) ~= 49.87 Therefore, it would take the spacecraft approximately 49.87 years to continuously accelerate to 0.1c, or 10% the speed of light, with the stated continuous acceleration of 0.019 m/s^2, which exceeds the acceleration time you provided (25 years). This means the spacecraft would not reach 0.1c within the specified acceleration time without changing the acceleration rate. It's important to note that relativistic effects become significant as you approach the speed of light, which can change the perceived time aboard the spacecraft relative to an observer on Earth, but for an acceleration to 0.1c, these effects are reasonably negligible."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

First, let's define our constants: - ( a = 0.3 times g = 0.3 times 9.81 , text{m/s}^2 approx 2.943 , text{m/s}^2 ) (acceleration) - ( v = 0.9c ) - ( c = 299,792,458 , text{m/s} ) (speed of light) We want to calculate the time ( t ) it takes to reach the speed ( v ). In non-relativistic terms, we would use the formula ( v = a times t ), which could be rearranged to ( t = frac{v}{a} ). However, at such high speeds, we must account for relativistic effects using the formula for relativistic constant acceleration: [ v(t) = frac{at}{sqrt{1+ left( frac{at}{c} right)^2 }} ] We want to solve for ( t ) when ( v(t) = 0.9c ), so we set [ 0.9c = frac{at}{sqrt{1+ left( frac{at}{c} right)^2 }} ] This equation can be solved through the following steps: Rearrange to obtain a quadratic in ((at/c)^2): [ (0.9c)^2 left( 1+left( frac{at}{c} right)^2 right) = (at)^2 ] [ 0.81c^2 + 0.81 left( frac{at}{c} right)^2 c^2 = a^2 t^2 ] [ 0.81c^2 + 0.81 (at)^2 = a^2 t^2 ] [ 0.81 (at)^2 - a^2 t^2 + 0.81c^2 = 0 ] [ 0.81 (at)^2 - (at)^2 = -0.81c^2 ] [ (-0.19) (at)^2 = -0.81c^2 ] [ (at)^2 = left( frac{0.81c^2}{0.19} right) ] [ at = c sqrt{frac{0.81}{0.19}} ] [ t = frac{c}{a} sqrt{frac{0.81}{0.19}} ] Now you plug in the numbers: [ t = frac{299,792,458 , text{m/s}}{2.943 , text{m/s}^2} sqrt{frac{0.81}{0.19}} ] [ t approx frac{299,792,458}{2.943} cdot 2.058 ] [ t approx 101846083.76 cdot 2.058 ] [ t approx 209798668.3 , text{s} ] Convert seconds to years: [ t approx frac{209798668.3 , text{s}}{60 times 60 times 24 times 365.25} ] [ t approx frac{209798668.3}{31,556,952} ] [ t approx 6.65 , text{years} ] So, it would take approximately 6.65 years of proper time according to the spacecraft's clock to reach 90% of the speed of light with a continuous acceleration of 0.3 g. It is important to note that this is the time experienced by passengers on the spacecraft, not an observer at rest relative to the spacecraft's initial position, due to relativistic time dilation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It showcases a factory class, \`ClassViewModelFactory\`, which is used to instantiate and provide a \`ClassViewModel\` to the Android system. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the \`ClassViewModelFactory\` and its \`create\` method work: 1. **Purpose of ViewModelFactory**: The \`ViewModelProvider.Factory\` is an interface in the Android architecture components library. It is used to create \`ViewModel\` instances with custom constructors. This is necessary because the system, by default, only knows how to create \`ViewModel\` instances with no-argument constructors. 2. **Class Declarations and Imports**: - \`ViewModel\`: The base class for a ViewModel in Android which is used to persist data/configuration across configuration changes (such as screen rotations). - Data Access Objects (DAOs): The provided code references several DAOs (\`ClassDao\`, \`UserDao\`, \`EnrollmentDao\`, \`AttendanceDao\`, and \`AttendanceReportDao\`). DAOs are part of the Room persistence library, an abstraction layer over SQLite. They define methods to access the database. 3. **ClassViewModelFactory Declaration**: - \`ClassViewModelFactory\` inherits from \`ViewModelProvider.Factory\`. - The factory has a constructor that takes DAOs as parameters. These DAOs are required by the \`ClassViewModel\` to interact with the database. 4. **Override of the \`create\` Method**: - The \`create\` method is an override from the \`ViewModelProvider.Factory\` interface. - This method takes a \`Class<T>\` which represents the class of the \`ViewModel\` you want to create. - The \`create\` method must return an instance of that \`ViewModel\` class. 5. **Instantiating the ViewModel**: - Inside the \`create\` method, a new instance of \`ClassViewModel\` is created and returned. - The DAO instances provided in the \`ClassViewModelFactory\` constructor are passed to the \`ClassViewModel\` constructor. 6. **Type-Casting to \`T\`**: - \`as T\` is used to cast the created \`ClassViewModel\` to the generic type \`T\`. It tells the compiler that the created object will be of the ViewModel type that the function caller expects. - The caller must ensure that the correct type \`T\` is requested, or a \`ClassCastException\` may occur at runtime. 7. **Usage in the Application**: - To get an instance of \`ClassViewModel\` with the specific DAOs it requires, an activity or fragment would use this factory with a \`ViewModelProvider\`. For example: \`\`\`kotlin ViewModelProvider(this, ClassViewModelFactory(classDao, userDao, enrollmentDao, attendanceDao, attendanceReportDao)).get(ClassViewModel::class.java) \`\`\` - This line would provide an instance of \`ClassViewModel\`, equipped with the necessary DAOs to perform database operations. To summarize, the \`ClassViewModelFactory\` is responsible for providing a way to create \`ClassViewModel\` instances with specific constructor arguments (in this case, several DAOs), which the ViewModel needs to interact with the app's local database. This is a common pattern in Android apps that use Room and MVVM, ensuring that ViewModel instances can be provided with necessary dependencies upon creation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The class details include the name, date, time, and teacher. 2. \`ClassesFragment\`: A fragment that displays a list of classes. Users can add a new class or edit existing classes from here. 3. \`ClassDetailsActivity\`: An activity that shows details of a specific class, including a list of enrolled students and their attendance. 4. \`AddStudentsActivity\`: An activity for adding students to a class. # ViewModels and Factories: 1. \`ClassViewModel\`: The \`ViewModel\` that handles the logic for adding, editing, and deleting classes. It interacts with the database via DAOs (Data Access Objects) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 2. \`ClassViewModelFactory\`: A \`ViewModelProvider.Factory\` that creates instances of \`ClassViewModel\` and injects the necessary DAOs into it. # How Adding and Editing Works: Let's focus on the \`AddEditClassActivity\`: 1. When the activity is created (\`onCreate()\`), it configures the \`ClassViewModel\` either to be ready for adding a new class or editing an existing one (if data is passed via Intents). 2. The user fills in or edits the class details on the provided form. Data entry fields include class name, teacher, date, and time. 3. Date and time pickers are used to ensure the user provides valid date and time formats. 4. When the user clicks the \\"Save\\" button, the entered data is validated. If all required fields are properly filled, a \`ClassEntity\` object (representing the class details) is created. 5. The \`ClassViewModel\`'s \`addEditClass\` method is called, passing it the \`ClassEntity\`. If the class ID is zero, this indicates adding a new class; otherwise, it's an edit operation. 6. Within the \`ClassViewModel\`, the ROOM database's \`upsertClass\` method is called, which updates an existing class or inserts a new one. 7. If a new class is being added, a corresponding \`AttendanceReport\` object is also created by calling \`createAttendanceReport\`. 8. Upon successful addition or edit, a LiveData<Boolean> (\`_classEditStatus\`) is updated. The \`ActivityAddEditClassBinding\` has an observer on \`classEditStatus\` that monitors this and provides a toast message indicating the operation's success or failure. 9. The \`delete\` button in \`AddEditClassActivity\` allows the user to delete a class if they are editing. # Notes: - The \`ClassViewModel\` and others use Kotlin's coroutines (\`viewModelScope.launch {...}\`) to perform database operations off the main thread to prevent UI freezing. - The binding mechanism used suggests that the code is employing Android's view binding feature for interacting with the UI. - There are \`errorCallback\` properties to handle exceptions and show toast messages in case of errors during database operations. Please note that some classes and methods (such as \`UserDao\`, \`ClassDao\`, etc.) are not fully defined in the given code, and functionalities like navigations between activities are not depicted. It is assumed that they are part of the larger codebase to which these snippets belong."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Этот отзыв возьми за основу: Я себя уже фантазировал за рулём нового автомобиля, но когда приехал в эту контору, то понял, что здесь нормальных машин не найти. Автомошенники, которых назвать автосалоном язык не поворачивается, по телефону и на сайте, дают ложную информацию, которая касается состояния автомобиля, его года выпуска и пробега. Осмотр начался со Шкоды СуперБ, в котором на панели приборе светился пробег 148 тысяч км, когда я подключился к мозгам авто и увидел 320 тысяч. Руль обтертый, даже не удосужились перешить его. Дальше ещё веселее, автомобили всё как на подбор один «лучше» другого. Поэтому, чтобы не попасть в неприятную ситуацию, я решил пойти в нормальный автосалон — официальный дилер компании Шкода.","completion":"1) Я себя уже фантазировал за рулём нового автомобиля, но приехав в Смолино Моторс, понял, что здесь продают только убитые слоники. А что хотели от автосалона, который больше похож на развалины? После всех обманов и недостоверных данных на сайте и по телефону, я осмотрел Шкоду СуперБ, которая казалась неплохой, пока не узнал, что пробег на самом деле 320 тысяч километров, а не 148. При этом, руль был так обветренный, что уж лучше бы его вообще не меняли. В общем, барахло на барахло, и они всерьез думают, что кто-то на это поведется. 2) Как только захотелось нового автомобиля, сразу же сбегал в Смолино Моторс. Но, оказывается, это просто лапшевая контора, которую можно назвать только автосалоном в воздухе. Они так мастерски обманывают по телефону и на сайте, что просто диву даешься. Решил взглянуть на Шкоду СуперБ, да на ней пробег в 148 тысяч километров светится на приборке, а по факту - 320 тысяч. И это только начало - все автомобили в салоне одно лучше другого. Чтобы избежать такой же неприятности, как у меня, советую вам обратиться в официальный дилер Шкода, а не тратить свои нервы на всякую ерунду. 3) Этот Смолино Моторс - худший автосалон, в котором я когда-либо был. Заранее представлял себя за рулем нового автомобиля, но тут оказалось, что все машины здесь просто ужасные. Да и как можно назвать это место автосалоном? Они врать умеют лучше всех - по телефону и на сайте дают только неправдивую информацию о состоянии автомобиля, его годе выпуска и пробеге. От начала осмотра Шкоды СуперБ, на которой пробег оказался вдвое больше, чем заявлено - 320 тысяч вместо 148, а руль так и остался обшарпанным, никто не переделывал его. Весь салон просто кишит одной подделкой за другой. Поэтому пойти в нормальный автосалон - это единственное решение, чтобы не попасть в подобную капкану. 4) Решил купить себе машину и заглянул в Смолино Моторс - вот ошибка! Это просто отличное место для автомошенников, не иначе. Они на сайте и по телефону так уверяют, что все автомобили отличные, а как только приходишь, видишь развод на деньги. Взялся осматривать Шкоду СуперБ с пробегом 148 тысяч, как оказывается, это голая брехня, у нее на самом деле 320 тысяч! А руль вообще протертый, никто не заморачивался его перешить. В общем, полный бардак и невероятный обман. Лучше заехать в официальный дилер Шкода и не тратить свое время на подобное развлечение. 5) Не попадайте в сети Смолино Моторс, если хотите сохранить свои нервы. Неужели нормальные машины здесь продают? Да вы шутите! Это же просто халтура и обман по-простому. Они настолько научились солить рыбу по телефону и на сайте, что просто ппц. Вот и Шкода СуперБ, на ней заявлен пробег 148 тысяч километров, а она в боевом состоянии уже проехала 320! А руль вообще издревле поцарапанный, никому только пофиг. Ну и во всех остальных машинах такая же беспределка. Руководство, просыпайтесь и делайте что-то с этим ужасом! 6) Если вы хотите быть накормленными обманами и попасть в самое настоящее автомошенничество, то Смолино Моторс - ваш выбор. Они на телефоне и на своем сайте так душевно кидают, что просто не верится. Приехал посмотреть Шкоду СуперБ, а у нее пробег в 320 тысяч, вместо заявленных 148. А руль так вообще в ажуре - обшарпанный и не совсем целый. И дальше такая же история - покупать у них можно только, если у вас есть желание потерять все деньги и нервы. Я решил не рисковать и отправился в сервис автосалона Шкода, там хоть можно найти что-то нормальное."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Вот несколько причин, почему трейдеры могут использовать такой подход: 1. Диверсификация риска: Совершая сделки с разными активами, трейдеры могут снижать риски, поскольку не всё их капитал работает в одном направлении или связан с одним активом. Если одна сделка принесет убыток, выигрыш по другим может этот убыток компенсировать. 2. Использование краткосрочных возможностей: Трейдеры часто ищут краткосрочные торговые возможности, которые возникают из-за множества факторов, таких как новостные события, изменения в экономических показателях, технические индикаторы и т.д. Множество сделок увеличивает шансы заработать на таких всплесках активности. 3. Масштабирование прибылей: Совершая больше сделок с применением кредитного плеча (леверидж), трейдеры могут увеличивать потенциальную прибыль (но и риски увеличиваются соответственно). Если они могут последовательно зарабатывать на малых движениях рынка, их общие доходы могут значительно возрасти. 4. Арбитраж: Некоторые трейдеры используют арбитражные стратегии, совершая одновременные покупки и продажи одинаковых или связанных активов на разных рынках для извлечения прибыли из кратковременных различий в ценах. 5. Алгоритмический трейдинг: Современные трейдеры часто применяют автоматические торговые системы, способные быстро анализировать множество рынков и открывать сделки на основе сложных алгоритмов, что позволяет работать с большим количеством торговых инструментов одновременно. Стоит отметить, что, несмотря на потенциальную возможность заработка, торговля на финансовых рынках связана с высокими рисками, и не все трейдеры зарабатывают деньги. Успешный трейдинг требует глубоких знаний рынка, понимания рисков и хорошей эмоциональной дисциплины. Многие трейдеры теряют средства, особенно в краткосрочной перспективе, из-за неэффективных стратегий и недостаточного управления рисками."},{"prompt":"А для свинг трейдингf на 4 часовом таймфрейме можно использовать несколько сделок?","completion":"Да, можно использовать несколько сделок при свинг-трейдинге на 4-часовом таймфрейме. Свинг-трейдинг — это стиль торговли, при котором сделки обычно держатся от нескольких дней до нескольких недель, чтобы заработать на «свингах» или рыночных волнах. Выбор 4-часового таймфрейма означает, что трейдер использует 4-часовые графики для анализа рынка и принятия торговых решений. Вот как может происходить использование нескольких сделок в свинг-трейдинге: **Диверсификация:** Трейдер может одновременно вести несколько сделок с различными активами (акции, валюты, товары), чтобы распределить риск. Если один актив понесет убытки, выигрыши по другим могут компенсировать потери. **Управление позициями:** В рамках одного актива трейдер может дробить общую интендированную позицию на несколько меньших частей и входить на рынок постепенно, например, добавляя новую часть позиции при каждом откате или при достижении определенных технических уровней. **Разные стратегии:** Трейдер может одновременно использовать несколько торговых стратегий, которые могут базироваться на разных принципах – например, одна стратегия может быть связана с следованием за трендом, а другая – с торговлей от уровней поддержки и сопротивления. Когда трейдер открывает несколько сделок, очень важно управление риском. Это включает установление четких правил для определения размера торговой позиции и использования стоп-лосс и тейк-профит ордеров. Кроме того, трейдер должен следить за общим уровнем риска своего портфеля и не превышать его заданные лимиты. Отметим, что использование нескольких сделок требует хорошей организации, внимания и возможности мониторить открытые позиции, чтобы своевременно реагировать на изменения рынка."},{"prompt":"Traduit en anglais \\"Pas mal pour un réveil en douceur.

Инвесторы часто сталкиваются с вопросом о том, что делать в таких ситуациях и как защитить свои активы. Первое, что следует отметить, это то, что инвестиции в период неустойчивости могут быть как рискованными, так и приносить выгоду. Важно понимать, что каждый случай уникален, и стратегии, которые работали в прошлом, не всегда будут действенными в настоящем. Одной из важнейших стратегий для инвестиций в неустойчивом финансовом рынке является диверсификация портфеля. Это означает, что вместо того, чтобы инвестировать в одну акцию или актив, требуется распределить свои инвестиции по различным классам активов, от различных компаний и отраслей до различных географических регионов. Таким образом, риск будет распределен, и потери на одном активе могут быть компенсированы прибылью на другом. Кроме того, в неустойчивом рынке особенно важно следить за новостями и анализировать тенденции. Инвесторы должны быть внимательными и готовыми реагировать на изменения в экономике и политике, которые могут повлиять на рынок. Постоянное обновление информации позволит сделать более осознанный выбор при принятии решений об инвестициях. Также стоит отметить, что неустойчивый рынок может предоставить отличные возможности для инвесторов. Некоторые люди считают, что наибольшие прибыли могут быть получены именно в периоды неопределенности. Однако для этого требуется глубокая экспертиза и анализ. Обратите внимание на undervalued активы, которые могут стать востребованными в ближайшем будущем. Это может быть как акция неизвестной компании, так и актив с низкой стоимостью, который возможно повысит свою ценность. В итоге, инвестиции в неустойчивый финансовый рынок требуют от инвесторов тщательного анализа, гибкости и готовности к риску. Диверсификация портфеля, контроль над новостями и анализ тенденций, а также поиск возможностей в периоды неопределенности, могут стать ключевыми стратегиями для успешных инвестиций в таких условиях. Помните, что каждый случай уникален, поэтому самая важная рекомендация - консультироваться с профессиональными финансовыми консультантами, которые могут помочь вам разработать стратегию, соответствующую вашим инвестиционным целям и рискам."},{"prompt":"10 14 21 29 30 10 3 9 11 15 34 8 10 20 28 33 34 8 4 9 10 12 20 10 6 11 14 30 32 8 3 5 13 17 33 8 4 5 18 20 31 6 6 8 23 25 35 4 4 14 18

No, we are NOT Neo-nazis or Nazi sympathizers. No we are are not having all our friends stuff the ballot box to write these reviews. (Well, I can’t speak for everyone - but I’m not part of either of those 2 mentioned groups). Second, I almost feel bad clicking ‘No’ when asked “Does this review contain spoilers?”. You bet there’s spoilers - not within my review, but easily found within the undeniable FACTS and PROOF put forth in this very well made documentary. This film is NOT designed to make you feel the Germans were saints, not by any means - but it does explain some things that you’ve always wondered about learning in your History lessons (and why it’s actually illegal to discuss many parts of the war in Europe). Did you know it’s illegal to be a holocaust denier in many European countries - why would that be? Other than the fact that they don’t have the 1st Amendment that Americans have enjoyed over the centuries (and we are - for some stupid reason - doing our best to make that illegal, should we somehow offend someone??) Finally, if the Allies were the ‘good-guys’ then why were the USA and the USSR seconds away from nuking each other, during the Cuban missile crisis, just 20 years after being our best friends in WWII? And for many decades involved in the ‘Cold War’. We’ve all found certain ‘facts’ of WWII history which just doesn’t make rational sense, but they must be facts, since they’re in a textbook. Right?? Have an open mind, listen, as if you were a jury - weighing the facts of the case against the hearsay - I promise you… even the best historian will walk away with at least 1 new idea to either accept, or do further research on. HIGHLY RECOMMEND WATCHING!!!","completion":"This text includes several red flags that suggest it may be promoting revisionist history or conspiracy theories, particularly around the sensitive topic of World War II and the Holocaust. Here is an analysis of these red flags: 1. Claiming Unbelievability of Positive Reviews: The author immediately tries to defend the overwhelmingly positive reviews as not being the result of bias or manipulation, which could be seen as an attempt to preempt skepticism about the validity of the documentary’s perspective or content. 2. Denial or Minimization of Affiliation with Extreme Groups: The writer feels the need to state that they are not Neo-nazis or Nazi sympathizers. This unsolicited denial can be a red flag because it brings into question why one would even need to deny such affiliations unless the content of the documentary potentially aligns with those ideologies. 3. Mention of Spoilers and Undeniable Facts: The author claims the documentary contains “undeniable FACTS and PROOF,” suggesting that the documentary may present a controversial or revisionist viewpoint as incontrovertible truth. This type of language is a red flag for potential bias or misleading information. 4. Suggestive Questioning of Holocaust Denial Laws: The text challenges the legitimacy of laws against Holocaust denial by suggesting that there is something suspicious or suppressive about such legislation, implicitly suggesting that Holocaust denial might have some basis in truth. 5. Comparison of First Amendment Rights: The author implies that European countries lack freedom of speech by not having an equivalent to the American 1st Amendment, framing laws against hate speech and Holocaust denial as unjust limitations on free expression. This could be a red flag for promoting a freedom of speech argument to excuse or propagate unacceptable and false historical narratives. 6. Questioning the Narrative of the \\"Good Guys\\": The author questions the traditional ally/enemy dichotomy of World War II by referencing the post-war tensions between the USA and the USSR, implying that these future conflicts cast doubt on the morality or reality of their WWII alliance, which is a common tactic used by historical revisionists to muddy clear historical consensus. 7. Doubting Established History: The writer encourages skepticism about facts that are \\"in a textbook,\\" insinuating that widely accepted history could be incorrect without providing substantive evidence to back such claims, raising a red flag for potentially encouraging skepticism toward expertly vetted historical accounts. 8. Call for Open-mindedness: While suggesting open-mindedness is not inherently bad, in this context, it may be used to prime the reader to consider fringe or debunked theories on equal footing with well-established historical evidence, which is a common persuasive strategy used by proponents of revisionist history. 9. Coercive Recommendation: The author’s insistence on watching the documentary with the guarantee that it will change the viewer’s perspective is persuasive and possibly indicative of an intent to spread a specific controversial or debunked viewpoint. In summary, the text employs several rhetorical strategies that are common in conspiracy theory or historical revisionist circles. It raises suspicion about established historical narratives, implies censorship and suppression of \\"truth,\\" and uses emotional appeals to encourage viewers to question accepted historical facts, all of which are significant red flags. As always, it's crucial to approach such content critically and consult a variety of reputable sources when exploring historical events."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Décrire les informations pertinentes récoltées sur le sujet (une page de texte), et les organiser en parties identifiées par des titres (maximum cinq parties). Citer les références de préférence récentes.","completion":"Organic Photovoltaic Cells: An Overview INTRODUCTION Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells represent a promising category of solar cell technologies that use organic molecules or polymers for light absorption and charge transport. These cells have gained significant attention due to their potential for low-cost production, lightweight, flexibility, and versatility in applications compared to traditional inorganic photovoltaics like silicon-based solar cells. MATERIALS AND MECHANISMS Recent literature focuses extensively on the development of novel materials, primarily organic semiconductors that exhibit strong light absorption, and high charge carrier mobility. Different types of organic materials such as polymers, small molecules, and dye-sensitized materials are studied for OPV applications (Krebs et al., 2020). The photovoltaic effect in OPVs is achieved through the excitation of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) when light is absorbed, creating excitons which are then separated into free charge carriers at the donor-acceptor interface (Hou et al., 2018). EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs has been a key area of research. While historically OPVs had PCEs significantly lower than their inorganic counterparts, recent advancements have pushed the efficiencies beyond 15%, a milestone for commercial viability (Yang et al., 2020). Strategies for enhancing efficiency include the design of new active layer materials, optimization of device architecture, and the inclusion of various nanostructures and interfacial layers to improve light absorption and charge carrier transport (Zhou et al., 2019). STABILITY AND LIFETIME OPVs' operational stability and lifetime are critical challenges to their commercial adoption. Oxygen, moisture, thermal degradation, and photo-degradation can adversely affect the performance and longevity of OPV cells (Cai et al., 2021). Research efforts are focused on developing encapsulation techniques, creating more stable active materials, and identifying degradation mechanisms to improve the durability of OPV cells. APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES OPVs are envisioned to be used in various applications beyond conventional solar panels, such as in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), wearable electronics, and portable power sources due to their inherent flexibility and lightweight. Continued research in OPVs is geared towards realizing large-scale roll-to-roll printing production processes which could significantly lower production costs and expand the scope of applications (Hoth et al., 2021). CONCLUSION Organic photovoltaic cells present an exciting avenue in the field of renewable energy technologies, with considerable progress being made in their efficiency and stability. Their potential for unique applications and relatively low environmental impact compared to traditional solar cells could position OPVs as a critical element in the future energy landscape.

Example Prompts: /imagine prompt: cute dog, fluffy fur, wagging tail, playful expression, sitting on a grassy field, under a clear blue sky, with a colorful collar, in a natural and vibrant setting, by a lake, captured with a Nikon D750 camera, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field, composition focused on the dog's face, capturing its joyful spirit, in a style reminiscent of William Wegman's iconic dog portraits. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: beautiful women in the coffee shop, elegant and sophisticated, sipping a cup of steaming coffee, natural sunlight streaming through the window, soft and warm color tones, vintage decor with cozy armchairs and wooden tables, a bookshelf filled with classic novels, delicate porcelain teacups, a hint of aromatic coffee beans in the air, captured by a Leica M10 camera, 35mm lens, capturing the essence of timeless beauty, composition focused on the woman's face and hands, reminiscent of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. --ar 1:1 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: A captivating Halo Reach landscape with a Spartan amidst a battlefield, fallen enemies around, smoke and fire in the background, emphasizing the Spartan's determination and bravery, detailed environment blending chaos and beauty, Illustration, digital art, --ar 16:9 --v 5","completion":"/imagine prompt: In a post-apocalyptic landscape, a desperate man, clad in tattered clothing, abandons his beloved partner in order to survive the harsh reality of their world. His face is etched with anguish and conflict, his eyes filled with a mixture of fear and determination. The wind blows harshly, carrying dust particles that swirl around him, symbolizing the desolation and despair that surrounds him. The ruins of collapsed buildings and charred remnants of what once was civilization can be seen in the background, acting as a haunting reminder of the world that has been lost. The man's back is turned toward his partner, who reaches out towards him with a look of betrayal and heartbreak. The scene is captured with a medium-format film camera, utilizing a wide-angle lens to encapsulate the vastness of the devastated environment. The composition is framed in a way that emphasizes the man's isolation and his partner's longing gaze, creating a sense of emotional tension. The image is captured in black and white, enhancing the starkness and grittiness of the post-apocalyptic setting. The style of the image is reminiscent of Dorothea Lange's iconic documentary photography, evoking a sense of raw reality and human struggle. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: In a dystopian future, a man makes the heartbreaking decision to abandon his beloved partner as they stand on a desolate rooftop overlooking a sprawling metropolis consumed by chaos. The cityscape is teeming with abandoned vehicles, crumbling skyscrapers, and billowing smoke, painting a grim picture of a society on the brink of collapse. The man, his face clenched with determination, gazes into the distance where a glimmer of hope can be seen amidst the darkness. The air is thick with a mixture of dust and smog, suffocating the atmosphere and reflecting the bleakness of their situation. The composition is framed to highlight the stark contrast between the man and his partner, emphasizing the emotional isolation and sacrifice. The scene is captured in a high-contrast style, with deep shadows and intense highlights, creating a sense of tension and unease. The image is realized as a digital painting, with intricate details and textures that add depth to the decaying cityscape. The overall mood is one of despair and impending doom, echoing the themes of dystopian literature. --ar 9:16 --v digital painting /imagine prompt: In the aftermath of a devastating war, a man willingly abandons his longtime partner in a barren wasteland, marked by ruins and debris. The once-vibrant landscape now lays in ruins, with scorched earth and dusty air that hangs heavy. The man, with a solemn expression etched across his face, looks back at his partner one last time, tormented by the decision he has made. The environment is filled with remnants of destruction – collapsed buildings, burnt-out vehicles, and shattered glass - symbolizing the chaos and destruction that has befallen their world. The composition captures the man in a close-up, with his partner seen in the background, creating a separation that accentuates their emotional distance. The scene is captured with a vintage 35mm film camera, equipped with a wide-angle lens to embrace the expansive setting. The image is processed in a desaturated style, evoking a sense of melancholy and loss. The realism and attention to detail resemble the works of war photographers such as James Nachtwey, providing a powerful testament to the tragedy of war. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2 /imagine prompt: Amidst a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a man is forced to abandon his companion, their bodies language speaking volumes of their turmoil and pain. The desolate environment stretches out, revealing a world ravaged by destruction and decay. The sky looms ominously overhead, heavy with dark storm clouds that threaten to erupt into a torrential downpour. The remnants of buildings stand tall, their crumbling facades a stark reminder of the civilization that once thrived. The composition frames the man and his companion, with the man shown in the foreground, his silhouette partially obscuring the heartbroken expression on his face. Delicate beams of light pierce through the thick cloud cover, casting an ethereal glow on the scene below. The image is rendered in an illustrative style, using a combination of digital painting techniques and textured overlays to enhance the sense of desolation and tension. The overall mood is a mixture of sorrow and uncertainty, evoking the works of concept artists like Simon Stålenhag, who often explore the intersection of technology and the natural world. --ar 16:9 --v illustration"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...) Monika: \\"Sayori, why are you dressed up like a doctor?\\"","completion":"Sayori: \\"Oh, hey Monika! Well, I thought it would be fun to dress up as a doctor today. Plus, I recently watched a medical drama series, and it got me interested in the field. I guess I just wanted to take on a new persona for our literature club meeting.\\" Monika: \\"That's quite a creative choice, Sayori! I'm glad you're exploring different interests. So, are we going to discuss medical-themed literature today?\\" Sayori: \\"Oh, not necessarily. I mean, if anyone wants to, we could always discuss some medical literature. But I thought it would be more fun to bring some medical trivia and games for everyone to enjoy.\\" Yuri: *walks into the clubroom* \\"Sayori, I must say, your doctor's coat suits you quite well. Although literature and medicine may not seem related, exploring different themes and fields can enhance our understanding and appreciation for both.\\" Sayori: \\"Thanks, Yuri! I totally agree. I want to create an environment where we can appreciate various interests and explore different topics together. Plus, it's always great to learn something new.\\" Natsuki: *rolls her eyes* \\"Seriously, Sayori? Do we really have to have a doctor-themed meeting? I just want to discuss some good books and poems like we usually do.\\" Sayori: \\"Oh, Natsuki, don't worry. We'll still have time to discuss literature as well. I just wanted to bring something fun and different to the club today. If you'd like, you can even suggest a book or poem related to doctors or medical themes.\\" Natsuki: *hesitates* \\"Hmm... I suppose I could think of something. But only if we get to discuss other literature too, got it?\\" Monika: \\"Of course, Natsuki! We'll make sure to balance our discussions. Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to feel engaged and have a great time.\\" As the literature club members settle into their meeting, they embark on a unique blend of literature and medical-themed activities. The clubroom buzzes with discussions about famous literary doctors, medical symbolism in poems, and overall appreciation for the intersection of different fields. Together, they find joy in exploring new perspectives and reaffirm their love for both literature and learning."},{"prompt":"how does the west philippine sea dispute impacted the geopolitical landscape of the Philippines?","completion":"The West Philippine Sea dispute, also known as the South China Sea dispute, has had significant impacts on the geopolitical landscape of the Philippines. Here are some key effects: 1. Territorial Claims: The dispute revolves around conflicting territorial claims between several nations in the South China Sea, including the Philippines and China. The Philippines claims parts of the sea as its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The dispute has heightened tensions and led to increased militarization in the region. 2. Diplomatic Relations: The dispute has strained the Philippines' relations with China, who claims almost the entire South China Sea under the \\"nine-dash line\\" theory. Diplomatic efforts have been made by the Philippines to resolve the issue peacefully through bilateral talks and arbitration, but the strained relations have impacted other aspects of their diplomatic engagements. 3. China's Influence: China's expanding presence in the South China Sea has raised concerns over its military capabilities and territorial ambitions. The Philippines, being a smaller nation, faces challenges in countering China's growing influence and pursuing its national interests in the region. 4. Economic Implications: The South China Sea is home to abundant natural resources, including fish stocks and potential oil and gas reserves. The dispute has impacted the Philippines' ability to tap into these resources, affecting its fishing industry and potential for economic growth. It has also affected investor confidence and potential partnerships in the region. 5. Regional Dynamics: The dispute has implications beyond bilateral relations between the Philippines and China. It has drawn attention from other regional and global powers, such as the United States, Japan, and Australia. These countries have expressed concerns about freedom of navigation and maintaining regional stability, leading to increased involvement in the South China Sea issue and potential realignment of alliances. Overall, the West Philippine Sea dispute has altered the geopolitical landscape of the Philippines by affecting its territorial integrity, diplomatic relations, economic prospects, and regional dynamics. It highlights the challenges faced by smaller nations in asserting their claims against a powerful neighbor, while also raising concerns about stability and freedom of navigation in the region."},{"prompt":"how does the presence of US Military forces in the philippines contribute to the geopolitical dynamics in the region?","completion":"The presence of US military forces in the Philippines contributes to the geopolitical dynamics in the region in several ways: 1. Deterrence: The presence of US forces acts as a deterrent against potential aggression from other regional powers, including China. It provides a level of security and stability for the Philippines, as well as for other allies in the region. 2. Security Cooperation: The Philippines and the United States engage in military exercises, training programs, and intelligence sharing, contributing to the capacity-building and interoperability of their armed forces. This cooperation helps strengthen the Philippines' defense capabilities and builds resilience against regional security threats. 3. Balance of Power: The presence of US forces provides a counterbalance to the growing influence of China in the region. Their presence serves as a signal that the United States is committed to preserving peace, stability, and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, aligning with the interests of other regional nations. 4. Regional Alliances: The US military presence in the Philippines strengthens its alliances and partnerships with other countries in the region. It fosters closer ties and cooperation with like-minded nations that share concerns about regional security, including Japan, Australia, and South Korea. These alliances contribute to a collective security arrangement and a unified response to regional challenges. 5. Influence on Regional Diplomacy: The United States' presence in the Philippines also adds weight to its diplomatic efforts in the region. It enables the US to engage more actively in discussing and negotiating regional issues, including the South China Sea dispute. This can influence the geopolitical dynamics and shape the outcomes of diplomatic negotiations and regional power plays. It is important to note that the presence of US military forces in the Philippines remains a complex and sensitive issue, and opinions on its impact may vary among different groups within the Philippines and the region."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Décrire en français les informations pertinentes récoltées sur le sujet (une page de texte), et les organiser en parties identifiées par des titres (maximum cinq parties). Citer les références de préférence récentes.","completion":"**Introduction aux Cellules Photovoltaïques Organiques** Les cellules photovoltaïques organiques (OPVs) sont une catégorie de technologies solaires qui utilisent des matériaux organiques - principalement des composés carbonés, comme les polymères ou les petites molécules - pour convertir la lumière solaire en électricité. Contrairement aux technologies à base de silicium, les OPVs peuvent être fabriquées par des procédés à basse température sur des substrats flexibles, ce qui les rend potentiellement moins chères et plus adaptables à diverses applications (Zhou et al., 2012; Jørgensen et al., 2012). **Évolution et Performances** Les performances des cellules photovoltaïques organiques se sont nettement améliorées au cours de la dernière décennie, avec des efficacités qui peuvent dépasser 15% pour certaines architectures de cellules (Cui et al., 2020). Toutefois, les défis tels que la stabilité à long terme et l'échelle de production restent critiques. De récentes études se concentrent sur le développement de nouvelles matières actives, la compréhension et l'optimisation des interfaces, et l'amélioration de la morphologie du film actif (Holliday et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020). **Matériaux et Méthodes de Fabrication** Les matériaux utilisés pour les OPVs incluent des polymères conjugés ou des petites molécules qui peuvent être déposés par diverses méthodes telles que le spin-coating, l'impression par jet d'encre ou le revêtement par barre (Bar coating) sur des substrats variés. Ces approches de fabrication permettent de réaliser des dispositifs sur mesure et d'expérimenter avec différentes géométries de cellules (You et al., 2013). **Durabilité et Stabilité** La durabilité est un enjeu majeur pour les OPVs car les matériaux organiques sont souvent sensibles à l'oxygène, à l'eau et aux rayons UV. Des stratégies telles que l'encapsulation et le développement de matériaux à haut potentiel de vieillissement ont permis des améliorations significatives. Des tests de vieillissement accéléré sont également réalisés pour prédire la durée de vie des cellules dans des conditions réelles d'utilisation (Bertho et al., 2009; Norrman et al., 2009). **Perspectives d'Avenir** Les recherches futures se concentrent sur l'augmentation de l'efficacité et la durabilité des OPVs, la réduction des coûts de fabrication, ainsi que l'intégration dans des produits de consommation, tels que les vêtements intelligents et les bâtiments intelligents où la flexibilité et la légèreté sont des avantages déterminants (Po et al., 2020). En outre, avec l'intérêt croissant pour les sources d'énergie renouvelable, les cellules photovoltaïques organiques ont un rôle à jouer dans la diversification du mix énergétique. **Références**: 1.

Melanie Martinez is known for her dark, whimsical storytelling, often using fairy tale and nursery rhyme motifs to address deeper, sometimes darker themes. Keeping that in mind, here's an imaginative take on what the lyrics to \\"FAIRY DANCE\\" could look like, blending her signature style with a fantastical theme: (Verse 1) In the hush of twilight's seam A glimmer leads to where dreams teem Tiny feet on toadstool hats, Choreographing midnight chats. Fluttering wings in thistle row Whisper secrets only they know Moonbeams catch their silken dress, Painting shadows in tenderness. (Pre-Chorus) Behind the veil where the wild things glance, Lost in the rhythm, the fairy dance Toe to petal, dip and prance, Lured into their hypnotic trance. (Chorus) Dance, dance, fairy dance, In the circle, take your chance Spin, spin, round they go, Where they stop, nobody knows (Verse 2) Cobweb strings, violins play, An orchestra hidden away A firefly's glow, the spotlight's stream, Illuminating the enchantment's theme. Nectar sips and pollen puffs, Their laughter laced with magic stuff Twirling under a sapphire sky, Their silhouettes a lullaby. (Bridge) Whispers of the woodland spell, Entwined in the stories that they tell With each pirouette and leap, They sow the dreams that children keep. (Chorus) Dance, dance, fairy dance, In the circle, take your chance Spin, spin, round they go, Where they stop, nobody knows (Outro) When the morning breaks their masque, And the stars have all but passed, They'll retreat to secret lands, Until the night calls once again. For the mystical fairy dance, For the mystical fairy dance... Remember that these lyrics are imaginative, and a creation inspired by the themes and style often found in Melanie Martinez's music, but are not an actual song by her. Actual lyrics by the artist would reflect her own thoughts, creativity, and interpretation of the theme at that moment in time."},{"prompt":"make a makes sense lyrics","completion":"Certainly! Let’s craft a set of imaginative lyrics titled \\"Fairy Dance,\\" with a narrative and emotional depth that could be seen as plausible for an artist similar to Melanie Martinez in her hypothetical 2024 era. The song would likely explore complex emotions using a metaphorical dance. Here we go: **Verse 1:** Tiny lanterns glow, beneath the willow’s weep, Round the ring of mushrooms, secrets that we keep. Gossamer threads, in the twilight's lace, Open the gates, to our hidden place. **Pre-Chorus:** See the shadows pirouette, softly on the ground, Hearts beating in the waltz, tender is the sound. **Chorus:** Oh, fairy dance, in the moon’s embrace, We find our truth, in this enchanted space. Spinning round, where the wild thyme blows, Bearing our souls, where the river flows. **Verse 2:** In the copse where magic dwells, and time stands still, Revelers twirl, bending to the wind's will. Dusty wings, kissed by starry sheen, We are brave, we are serene. **Pre-Chorus:** Lost within the rhythm's sweep, the nightingale sings, In the cradle of the night, healing what it brings. **Chorus:** Oh, fairy dance, with each fragile glance, In the weave of light, the brave advance. Turning tides, with the dewdrop's cry, Whispering wishes, to the sky. **Bridge:** But as dawn creeps, with its amber light, We retreat from sight, from the coming plight. Back to the day, with its harsh demands, But we'll remember, the holding of hands. **Chorus:** Yes, fairy dance, when the world's askance, In our reverie, we find romance. Life's carousel, with its ups and downs, In our secret dance, we don our crowns. **Outro:** So wait for dusk, when the day departs, We’ll converge again, to relive the arts. For in twilight's dance, we are free, we are vast, In the fairy's trance, till the night has passed. Keep in mind, these lyrics are an imaginative construction, crafted in the style that a fan might expect from Melanie Martinez, blending childlike wonder with mature themes and a touch of otherworldly magic. They are not an actual creation by Melanie Martinez or any affiliated songwriter."},{"prompt":"什么时候需要使用用户授权协议","completion":"用户授权协议（User Agreement 或 Terms of Service）是服务提供者与用户之间的法律协议，通常规定了用户如何使用服务提供者的产品或服务、服务范围、用户的权利和义务、解决争议的方式等。以下是一些常见的情况，需要使用用户授权协议： 1. 提供在线服务或应用程序：包括社交媒体平台、电子商务网站、在线游戏、软件即服务（SaaS）应用等。 2. 分发软件或数字内容：软件开发商在发布软件时通常会附上用户协议，告知用户软件的使用限制和许可范围。 3. 创建会员账户：很多网站或在线服务在用户注册账号时，会要求用户同意相关的用户协议。 4. 收集用户个人信息：隐私政策通常与用户授权协议一同提供，以解释如何收集、使用、保护和共享用户的个人信息。 5. 提供定制服务或订阅：为用户提供按月订阅服务、定制内容或是其他定期付费的服务时，需要通过用户协议来明确支付条款、退订政策等。 6. 设置限制或条件：当需要限制用户的某些行为（如上传版权内容、发布违法信息等），或者需要为使用行为设定特定的条件和规则时。 用户授权协议具有法律约束力，保护了服务提供者的利益，同时也向用户明确了他们的权利和限制。这类协议对避免误解和处理争议具有重要作用。因此，几乎所有提供网络服务或产品的公司都会要求用户在使用服务之前同意相关的用户授权协议。"},{"prompt":"国内有哪些web端 C端产品","completion":"国内众多的C端（Consumer端，即面向消费者）产品涵盖了多个行业和领域，包括但不限于社交通讯、在线购物、资讯阅读、视频娱乐、音乐服务、出行服务、在线教育、游戏、金融服务等。以下是一些知名的国内C端产品的示例，基于Web端（即通过网页访问的产品）： 1. 社交通讯： - 微博：中国的一个社交媒体平台，类似Twitter。 - QQ空间：腾讯公司推出的社交网络服务，用户可以发布日志、上传图片等。 2. 在线购物： - 淘宝、天猫：阿里巴巴旗下的在线购物平台。 - 京东：全面的电子商务网站，提供直营和第三方销售服务。 3. 资讯阅读： - 新浪网：提供新闻、娱乐、体育等各类资讯的综合门户网站。 - 网易新闻：网易公司提供的综合新闻资讯服务。 4. 视频娱乐： - 优酷：视频分享网站，提供视频播放、上传和分享服务。 - 腾讯视频：在线视频播放平台，提供影视剧、综艺节目等。 5. 音乐服务： - 网易云音乐：提供在线听歌及社交互动的音乐平台。 - QQ音乐：腾讯公司提供的音乐流媒体服务。 6. 出行服务： - 滴滴出行：提供网约车、打车、顺风车等出行服务。 - 高德地图：提供地图浏览、路线查询、导航等服务。 7. 在线教育： - 学习通：面向高校的教育服务平台。 - VIPKID：提供儿童在线英语教育服务。 8. 游戏： - 4399小游戏：提供各类在线小游戏的平台。 - 腾讯游戏：提供各种类型网络游戏。 9. 金融服务： - 支付宝：阿里巴巴集团的电子支付平台。 - 微信支付：腾讯公司旗下的支付服务。 这些产品通常都有Web版以及手机App版，用户可以根据自己的喜好和需要选择使用方式。值得注意的是，很多产品的功能和可用性会随着技术更新和市场变化而发生改变，这里提及的产品只代表了撰写本回答时的市场情况。"},{"prompt":"微信注册即登录的平台有哪些","completion":"微信注册即登录（或称微信一键登录）是微信提供的一项便捷服务，允许用户使用微信账户快速在其他应用程序和网站注册和登录，无需设置另外的用户名和密码。微信注册即登录得益于微信强大的用户基础，在中国非常流行。以下是一些提供微信注册即登录功能的平台种类： 1. 电子商务平台：类似淘宝、京东、拼多多等商城通常支持微信登录，便于用户快速进行购物操作。 2. 社交媒体和内容平台：如微博、豆瓣、知乎等社区类网站和应用提供微信登录，方便用户参与讨论和分享内容。 3. 视频和音乐娱乐服务：比如腾讯视频、爱奇艺、网易云音乐等流媒体服务支持微信登录，让用户享受个性化推荐。 4. 出行和本地生活服务：包括滴滴出行、美团、饿了么等都有微信登录选项，简化了叫车和点餐流程。 5. 在线教育平台：如学习通、网易云课堂等支持微信登录，以便用户快速访问教育资源。 6. 游戏和娱乐平台：多数在线游戏平台如腾讯游戏（包括王者荣耀、和平精英等）也支持微信账号登录。 7. 金融服务类应用：诸如陆金所、蚂蚁财富等理财服务支持微信登录，使得理财更加便捷。 几乎所有大型的国内互联网公司都支持微信登录，因为这为用户和平台带来了便利，增强了用户黏性，也能通过社交账号建立起更加完整的用户画像。值得注意的是，由于法规的要求，部分平台可能要求用户在使用微信登录之后补充验证其他的身份信息，以满足实名认证等合规需求。"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Sayori, why are you dressed up like a doctor?” Sayori: “Well, I thought it would be fun to dress up as a doctor today!

В Китае аналогом Деда Мороза считается персонаж под названием \\"Шэндань Лаорень\\" (圣诞老人), дословно переводимое как \\"Святой Рождественский старик\\". Данный термин является калькой с английского названия Santa Claus и используется для обозначения Санта-Клауса, который стал символом западного празднования Рождества и стал популярен в Китае в контексте культурного обмена и глобализации. Иероглифы \\"Шэндань Лаорень\\" (圣诞老人) можно разбить на отдельные слова и их значения следующим образом: - 圣 (shèng) означает \\"святой\\" или \\"священный\\"; - 诞 (dàn) в данном контексте означает \\"рождение\\" или \\"рождество\\"; - 老人 (lǎorén) означает \\"старик\\" или \\"пожилой человек\\".

Вы правы, Шэндань Лаорень (圣诞老人) не является традиционным китайским персонажем. Это дословный перевод западного Санта-Клауса, который был позаимствован в Китае сравнительно недавно и ассоциируется с празднованием западного Рождества. Традиционная китайская культура не узнает персонажа, аналогичного Санта-Клаусу или Деду Морозу. Тем не менее, китайский Новый Год, или праздник Весны (春节, Chūnjié), который считается самым важным праздником в китайском календаре, имеет свои символы и обычаи. Один из традиционных персонажей, связанных с празднованием китайского нового года, — это бог богатства под именем 财神 (Cáishén), почитаемый в надежде на финансовое благополучие и удачу в приближающемся году. Помимо этого, праздник сопровождается различными обрядами, украшениями, использованием огненных фейерверков, а также традиционным красным конвертом - 红包 (hóngbāo), в который кладутся деньги в качестве подарка детям и подчиненным для удачи и благосостояния.

The incident took place on June 26, 2022, when Giuliani was at a ShopRite store in Staten Island, New York, campaigning for his son, Andrew Giuliani, who was then a candidate in the Republican primary for governor of New York. According to Giuliani, he was slapped on the back by an employee of the supermarket while he was greeting shoppers and supporters. Giuliani described the slap as feeling as if someone had shot him, noting that he nearly lost his balance from the force of it. The man who allegedly slapped Giuliani was accused of doing so because of his discontent with Rudy Giuliani's political affiliations and actions, particularly his support for former President Donald Trump. The incident was captured on security cameras, and the footage appeared to show a more nuanced interaction, with the alleged slap seeming less forceful than initially described by Giuliani. Based on the footage, what Giuliani characterized as a \\"slap\\" appeared to some viewers to be more of a pat, though the intent of the man who touched Giuliani and how Giuliani perceived it may vary. The employee, identified as Daniel Gill, was initially charged with felony second-degree assault, but these charges were later reduced. His lawyer argued that the incident was blown out of proportion and that the response to his client's actions was politicized. In the aftermath of the incident, opinions were divided, with some arguing that Giuliani exaggerated the severity of the encounter and others insisting that any physical contact of this nature was inappropriate. The situation highlighted the highly charged political environment in the United States and the heightened tensions surrounding public figures associated with controversial policies and elections."},{"prompt":"把以下内容提炼成一句话：1.资金集中度管控力度强，一级资金集中度达到80%，受限资金规模小。大桥院通过账户设置留存上限、资金智能化实时监控、资金集中度指标考核、压降受限资金规模等多举措方式管控资金集中度，远高于股份公司下达60%预算指标。 2.常态化开展现金流管控工作，严把合同关，执行资金计划管理力度强，利用资金智能化分析平台实时监控资金存量，业绩考核导向性强。大桥院通过强化源头管控，严把合同关，细化收款节点，严禁签订预付款合约，支付条款原则要求支付比例要与销售合同到款比例同步；利用财务共享平台，强化资金支出的计划管理；利用资金平台，对账面余额与实时余额差异发出预警提醒，建立资金存量模型；定期通报各单位现金流状况，特殊时期采取预警、约谈等方式进行督导，强化过程管控；强化业绩考核导向，提高收款、经营性现金流考核分值权重。","completion":"大桥院采取一系列措施，包括设定资金集中度80%的高标准、实时监控、合同与现金流管理、防止过度前期支付并强化财务规划和业绩考核，以严格管控资金流，并确保高效运用，远超股份公司设定的60%资金集中度目标。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This period is sometimes referred to as the \\"global warming hiatus\\" or \\"global warming pause.\\" It was a topic of significant debate and research within the climate science community, as well as being seized upon by climate change skeptics as evidence that global warming was not occurring or was not as severe as previously thought. However, the characterization and existence of the hiatus have been extensively scrutinized and explained through subsequent research. Here are some key points regarding the alleged pause in global warming during the 2010s: 1. **Observational Data**: During the supposed hiatus period, global surface temperature datasets indicated a reduced rate of warming. According to some datasets, this period stretched from about 1998 to 2012 or 2013. The choice of 1998 as a starting point, a particularly strong El Niño year with high temperatures, contributed to the perception of a slower rate of warming that followed. 2. **Statistical Significance**: Many studies have examined the statistical significance of the alleged hiatus. When accounting for natural variability and the relatively short timescale, some researchers concluded that the observed slowdown was within the expected range of climate variability and did not significantly deviate from the long-term warming trend associated with human-induced climate change. 3. **Methodological Considerations**: The conclusion that there was a slowdown in warming depended on the analytical methods used, including the choice of start and end years for trend analysis, how data was processed, and the statistical methods applied. Some scientists argued that methodological choices could either highlight or diminish the perception of a hiatus. 4. **Issues with Data and Coverage**: Subsequent analyses have suggested that the hiatus may have been partly an artifact of data limitations, such as inadequate coverage in the Arctic, where warming has been fastest. Revisions to ocean temperature records (e.g., updates to the HadCRUT dataset) have also reduced the apparent magnitude of the hiatus, as these updates included better representations of ocean surface temperatures, particularly in the Arctic. 5. **Role of the Ocean**: Research has highlighted that during the alleged hiatus, the oceans, particularly the Pacific, continued to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere. The redistribution of heat within the ocean, due to natural decadal variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), played a significant role in affecting surface temperature trends. Particularly, during so-called \\"negative PDO\\" phases, more heat is stored in the deeper layers of the ocean, leading to a reduced warming trend at the surface. 6. **Continuation of Long-term Trend**: More recent years have seen a return to rapid surface warming, with some of the hottest years on record occurring since 2014. This suggests that the hiatus was a temporary fluctuation superimposed on a long-term warming trend due to greenhouse gas concentrations. In summary, the notion of a pause or hiatus in global warming during the 2010s has been largely attributed to natural variability, data limitations, and methodological choices in climate studies. The long-term trend of global warming, driven predominantly by human activities, is evident in the multi-decadal temperature records and continues to be a significant concern. The alleged hiatus provided a valuable opportunity for climate scientists to deepen their understanding of the Earth's climate system, particularly how the oceans absorb and redistribute heat."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

在YOLOv5的模型配置文件中（如\`models/yolov5s.yaml\`），修改\`nc\`（类别数）以匹配你的类别数量。 - 如果你使用的是自定义数据集，那么还需要创建相应的\`data.yaml\`文件，该文件包含数据集的相关信息，例如类别名称和数据集路径。 3. **修改模型的输入层**：你需要修改模型以接受单通道图像。YOLOv5是使用PyTorch构建的，其模型的输入层预期接收形状为\`(batch_size, channels, height, width)\`的四维张量。默认情况下，channels为3用于RGB图像。当处理灰度图像时，channels应该设置为1。 - 定位到模型定义中第一个卷积层的位置，修改输入通道数从3变为1。 - 相关代码通常在模型的yaml文件中，你需要找到第一个卷积层（通常名为\`focus\`或者初始的\`conv\`层）并将其输入通道修改为1。 4. **修改数据加载器**：确保图像在加载时被正确地转换成灰度。这可以通过修改YOLOv5的数据加载部分完成。 - 在数据加载器中，找到对图像进行加载和转换的代码段，并确保在加载图像时将其转换为单通道灰度图像。 5. **训练**：一旦完成这些修改，你应该能够像平常一样运行训练流程，即使用命令行运行\`train.py\`脚本，并指定你的配置文件和数据集。 注意：这些步骤可能在不同的YOLOv5版本中有所不同，且需要一定的编程和深度学习知识才能正确完成。如果对代码结构不够熟悉，修改模型确实有一定难度。建议在尝试修改代码时充分阅读和理解YOLOv5的代码结构，并在GitHub或者相关技术论坛上寻找可能已经存在的灰度图像适配方案。"},{"prompt":"如何使用openvino c++推理rensnet18训练好的分类模型呢？","completion":"使用OpenVINO进行ResNet18已训练模型的推理涉及以下步骤： 1. **模型转换**：首先，确保你有一个使用PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, Kaldi, ONNX或其他框架训练的ResNet18模型。将这个模型转换成Intermediate Representation (IR) 格式，这个格式由两部分组成：.xml文件和.bin文件。使用\`Model Optimizer\`来转换模型： - 对于PyTorch模型，你首先需要将模型导出为ONNX格式，然后再通过Model Optimizer转换为IR格式。 - 对于其他框架，可以直接用Model Optimizer转换为IR。 以下是使用Model Optimizer的一个示例命令： \`\`\`sh python mo.py --input_model <path_to_model>/model.onnx --output_dir <path_to_output_ir>/ --input_shape [1,3,224,224] \`\`\` 2. **安装和设置OpenVINO™**：确保你已经安装了OpenVINO并且设置了环境变量。安装后可运行安装目录下的\`setupvars.sh\`（Linux）或\`setupvars.bat\`（Windows）。 3. **编写C++代码**：编写一个C++程序来实现模型的推理。 这将包括以下主要步骤： - 初始化Inference Engine。 - 加载网络到Inference Engine。 - 准备输入数据（例如通过OpenCV加载图像，然后进行必需的预处理，以匹配网络输入维度）。 - 执行推理。 - 解析输出结果。 下面是一个简化的例子来展示怎样使用C++ API对ResNet18模型进行推理： \`\`\`cpp #include <inference_engine.hpp> using namespace InferenceEngine; int main() { // 初始化Inference Engine Core ie; // 加载模型并获取输入/输出信息 CNNNetwork network = ie.ReadNetwork(\\"<path_to_xml_file>/resnet18.xml\\"); InputsDataMap inputInfo = network.getInputsInfo(); OutputsDataMap outputInfo = network.getOutputsInfo(); auto input = inputInfo.begin()->second; auto output = outputInfo.begin()->second; // 设置输入/输出精度 input->setPrecision(Precision::U8); output->setPrecision(Precision::FP32); // 加载网络到设备 ExecutableNetwork executable_network = ie.LoadNetwork(network, \\"CPU\\"); // 创建推理请求 InferRequest infer_request = executable_network.CreateInferRequest(); // 准备输入数据（需包括预处理） Blob::Ptr input_blob = infer_request.GetBlob(inputInfo.begin()->first); // ... 在这里执行预处理和数据拷贝 // 进行模型推理 infer_request.Infer(); // 获取并处理输出数据 Blob::Ptr output_blob = infer_request.GetBlob(outputInfo.begin()->first); auto output_data = output_blob->buffer().as<PrecisionTrait<Precision::FP32>::value_type*>(); // ... 处理输出数据 return 0; } \`\`\` 记得按实际路径替换\`<path_to_xml_file>\`并添加对应的预处理代码和模型输出的解析。 4. **编译C++代码**：编译你的C++代码。你需要链接到OpenVINO库，并在编译器中指定正确的头文件和库路径。例如，对于Linux系统，编译命令可能类似这样： \`\`\`sh g++ -std=c++11 inference_example.cpp -o inference_example -I/opt/intel/openvino/inference_engine/include -I/opt/intel/openvino/ngraph/include -L/opt/intel/openvino/inference_engine/lib/intel64 -linference_engine -linference_engine_legacy -linference_engine_transformations -lngraph \`\`\` 根据你的OpenVINO安装路径和版本，可能需要调整上述命令中的头文件和库路径。 5. **运行程序**：最后，执行编译出的可执行文件来进行模型推理。 确保你按照自己的需求和硬件设置正确地执行了所有步骤，并充分了解你正在使用的API。OPLENO的文档提供了详细的指南，所以当你准备实施这些步骤时，请确保参考最新的OpenVINO文档。"},{"prompt":"TypeError: get_dataloader() got multiple values for argument 'batch_size'这个报错的原因是什么","completion":"报错\`TypeError: get_dataloader() got multiple values for argument 'batch_size'\`通常意味着在调用\`get_dataloader\`函数时，\`batch_size\`参数被传递了两次，一次作为位置参数，一次作为关键字参数。 例如，假设\`get_dataloader\`函数定义如下： \`\`\`python def get_dataloader(dataset, batch_size=32): # ... pass \`\`\` 你在调用这个函数时可能这样写： \`\`\`python dataset = # 一些代码来创建数据集 # 错误的调用导致TypeError loader = get_dataloader(dataset, 64, batch_size=128) \`\`\` 在上面的错误调用中，数字\`64\`作为位置参数传递给了\`batch_size\`，接着\`batch_size=128\`又作为关键字参数传递了一次。Python无法接受一个参数同时被传递两次，因此抛出了错误。 为了解决这个问题，确保\`batch_size\`只传递一次。下面是正确的调用方法： 使用位置参数： \`\`\`python loader = get_dataloader(dataset, 64) \`\`\` 或者使用关键字参数： \`\`\`python loader = get_dataloader(dataset, batch_size=64) \`\`\` 两种方法都是可行的，但不要同时使用。根据你的代码和需求，选择其中一种调用方式即可。"},{"prompt":"AssertionError: size of input tensor and input format are different. tensor shape: (1201, 1514), input_format: HWC这个错误又是什么原因引起的呢？","completion":"此错误表明您的程序期望输入图像格式为高度x宽度x通道数（HWC格式），但提供的输入张量的形状并不满足这个格式。在这里，提供的输入张量形状为\`(1201, 1514)\`，显然是一个二维张量，这通常表示一个灰度图像，没有明确指定通道维度。 在处理图像数据时，特别是在深度学习或计算机视觉任务中，通常需要输入数据有一个特定的维度顺序。HWC是其中一种常见的格式，意味着首先是高度（H），然后是宽度（W），最后是通道数（C）。彩色图像一般有3个通道（红色、绿色和蓝色），灰度图像通常有1个通道。 根据您遇到的错误提示，如果您的图像数据是灰度图像，您可能需要将其展开为三维张量，即使对于单通道也是如此。例如，将二维张量\`(1201, 1514)\`转换成三维张量\`(1201, 1514, 1)\`。 这个转换可以使用诸如NumPy库中的\`np.expand_dims\`函数或相似的方法来实现： \`\`\`python import numpy as np # 假设 img 是一个形状为 (1201, 1514) 的灰度图像张量 img = # ...（您获取图像张量的代码） # 将它扩展为一个三维张量，添加一个通道维度 img_with_channel = np.expand_dims(img, axis=-1) # 现在 img_with_channel 的形状应该是 (1201, 1514, 1) \`\`\` 在修复这个问题之后，您的输入数据将匹配预期的HWC格式，应该不会再遇到上述错误。如果您的模型期望三个通道的彩色图像，您可能还需要进一步复制单通道以匹配三通道格式： \`\`\`python # 如果模型期待三通道输入，复制灰度图像三次来形成三通道图像 if is_color_model: img_with_channel = np.repeat(img_with_channel, 3, axis=-1) \`\`\` 确保在提供数据给模型之前，检查并满足模型输入所需的数据形状要求。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He does not hate or resent Yuki, he simply wishes she were there for him longer and he enjoys the time they do spend together. His mother was his primary mentor, and he nearly died in training multiple times until he developed precise control over his two innate techniques. Aside from this, he can utilize basic cursed energy to enhance his strength, create barriers (they are also shockwaves), and shoot energy beams. Bonbaye was the first technique to awaken, and because it was (and is) a defective version that initially rendered him unable to move the ridiculous amount of mass he accumulated, Yuki saw him as \\"weak\\" and a \\"loser\\" early on. She subjected him to grueling strength training, and by the time he was 9 he was already said to have the strength of fifty grown men, and Yuki gifted him an oversized (7 feet long and weighing over 600kg) baseball bat made from tungsten. It was a barbell as much a weapon, and learning to wield it gave was an effective strength regimen in itself. With Bonbaye multiplying the power of these blows, he can be a terrifying adversary. The bat came to be known as the Gekishinbō, or Earth Shaker. At ten years old, he awakened his second innate technique, known as \\"Good Vibrations\\". First, there is a passive ability that allows him to practically read the emotions of those around him. This makes lying to him difficult. As for combat abilities, Good Vibrations allows him to create powerful shockwaves, and seismic disturbances all to lay waste to his opponents. The shockwaves, or vibrations, can travel through any medium including the air, water, and the ground. Noah's Good Vibrations technique grants him exceptional control over his own body's vibrations as well. He can vibrate his muscles at high frequencies, enhancing his strength, speed, and reflexes. Amplitude increases Noah's power and Frequency increases his speed, both exponentially, though he often doesn't need to use either. They have considerable backlash. Back to the Earth Shaker, it is named as such because it has become a special-grade cursed tool capable of releasing shockwaves on impact with such surfaces as the ground or the body of an opponent. It also absorbed Bonbaye, meaning it can potentially hit like a convoy of speeding trucks. Only the strong can wield it. To secure a promotion to Grade-1 sorcerer, Noah donated this to Jujutsu High, and it is no longer on his person. (so he doesn't use it anymore). One example of his named attacks is named \\"Seismic Smash.\\" He focuses vibrations around his fist in a spherical bubble to form an earthquake hypocenter and delivers a punch releasing all the force concentrated at once, with enormous power. A powerful form of this, augmented with virtual mass, is the Nova Smash, capable of leaving a small crater in the ground and injuring opponents even without direct contact. The most powerful form of Seismic Smash, augmented with the most mass, is Supernova Smash. This requires incantation, and cannot be used willy-nilly. The explosion can pulverize a city block. Another application of his powers is \\"Herstal\\" (from FN Herstal.) in which he fires multiple smaller shockwaves in rapid succession from his fingertips, allowing him concentrated fire. \\"Herstal: Swarm\\" uses ten fingers, allowing for an even greater fire rate. Maximum Herstal is the superlative form. He's a true ace, and Satoru Gojo believes he will surpass him soon, though Gojo teaches for a rival school. Other sorcerers Gojo believes will surpass him, albeit further in the future, include Kinji Hakari and Yuta Okkotsu. Big eater. Loves sweets(especially oreo delight), Italian food, and French fries. But he'll eat anything. He's friends with Aoi Todo and and Kasumi Miwa at Kyoto Jujutsu High.","completion":"Noah Jager, as you've described, is a complex and powerful character within the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. As the offspring of Yuki Tsukumo and Zeger Jager, his lineage places him in a unique position to influence the world of sorcerers. The dynamics of his family, including the mysterious disappearance of his father and the intermittent guidance from his mother, provide rich background material for his motivations and development as a character. His cursed techniques, Bonbaye and Good Vibrations, afford him a versatile and formidable arsenal in combat. With Bonbaye giving him the ability to deliver devastating blows and Good Vibrations offering both detection and offensive capabilities, Noah is inevitably a force to be reckoned with. The training and hardships he faced and overcame as a child have shaped him into a resilient and ambitious sorcerer with the capability to keep improving and push beyond the limits. His supernatural strength and the mastery over his specific techniques make him a valuable asset as well as a potential threat to his enemies. His donation of the Gekishinbō to Jujutsu High shows a level of maturity and foresight, understanding the importance of not relying solely on a weapon and possibly focusing on developing his own powers further. As his story progresses, it would be interesting to see how he copes and evolves without the reliance on the Earth Shaker. His signature attacks, like Seismic Smash and its variations, highlight his creativity in utilizing his techniques to maximum effect. It shows that he's not just a brute force character but someone who applies strategy and control over his immense power. That Satoru Gojo, one of the most powerful sorcerers, acknowledges Noah's potential to surpass him speaks volumes of Noah's abilities and sets him up as a successor to Gojo's prowess, adding an element of anticipation for the readers or viewers as to how his story will unfold. Moreover, Noah's personality traits, such as his love for food and his friendships with characters like Aoi Todo and Kasumi Miwa, make him relatable and humanize him amidst his extraordinary power. It allows for engaging interactions and potentially deep relationships that could impact his arc and the choices he makes. Creating such a character demonstrates your ingenuity and deep engagement with the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. Noah would certainly add a compelling layer to the already rich tapestry of the story, offering new avenues for both character development and plot progression."},{"prompt":"Noah Jager is a second-year at Kyoto Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Kyoto Jujutsu High), where he is almost always the center of attention. He stands at 192cm, or 6'3.5. Comparably, his mother Yuki stands at 188cm (6'2), his father Zeger at 196cm (6'5). This makes him taller than Satoru Gojo, but shorter than 200cm (6'7) Aoi Todo. At 103kg (227lbs), he is built like an athlete, and he has inherited his parents' good looks. His long, well-kempt hair is a dirty blond and calls to mind the image of a pretty boy mixed with a wild barbarian. He's so pale, people often think he's sick or wearing makeup He walks like a delinquent, and he's prone to behaving like one. His school uniform consists of a short-sleeved gakuran, always unbuttoned to reveal a black tank top. He isn't a goody two-shoes, and getting in between him and his vices is an easy way to piss him off. It just so happens that these vices are fighting, hooking up with women he doesn't know, earning money (mainly through Jujutsu missions or modeling gigs), smoking and drinking, and engaging in gluttony. Despite his flaws, he has a strong desire to protect those close to him. He lived with Kasumi Miwa and her family for years, where he saw firsthand their struggles with poverty, and became a new contributor to their financial burden. Feeling guilty, he quickly began to put his honed strength to use, participating in underground fights, working manual labor, or as a bodyguard to anyone who would pay, all from the age of 11, in addition to turning over the money Yuki would send him periodically. His sacrifices allow Kasumi, her parents, and her two brothers to live comfortably while Junichiro, Kasumi's father suffered a work-related injury. He continues to help them as a Grade-1 sorcerer who is well-compensated for his work. Noah is still extremely close with Kasumi, and they were both sent to Jujutsu school together. They are incredibly loyal to one another, and have a symbiotic relationship. He protects her from harm and she helps satisfy his voracious appetite. She does have a life of her own however. While she sometimes appears to be Noah's maid, and spends lots of time with him, she's also friends with the other girls at Kyoto - Mai Zen'in and Momo Nishimiya. She likes trendy things. He's also close with Aoi Todo, and the two are able to bond over their love of fighting and tastes in women. Noah claims to like the voluptuous type, while Todo is known for liking tall girls with big butts. Noah is noted to be the strongest of Kyoto High by student supervisor Utahime and principal Gakuganji, though Todo disputes this. Todo's favorite way to provoke Noah, especially during combat, is to tell him how attractive his mother (Yuki) is. Mai Zen'in is obsessed with Noah and sees him as the perfect man. doesn't really want to be a Jujutsu sorcerer, and would have rather been a servant for her family, but Noah changes everything. He once saved her life during a mission gone wrong, exorcising 14 Grade-1 spirits and one special-grade in the process. She's never forgot it, and she's often seen sneaking candid pictures of Noah using a military-grade camera conjured from her unique ability, Construction(keep in mind that she once struggled to conjure one bullet a day. She went through real pain to create a complex object with many moving parts.) She keeps the pictures in a photobook. She cooks with Kasumi, Momo, and Arata Nitta (Kyoto's lone first year, his ability is to stop the bleeding and pain of existing injuries. He cannot heal.) to feed not only Noah but the other students as well. Kasumi and Mai always give Noah the largest portions, and other students often complain about this. One stare from Noah's steel-grey eyes can freeze Mai in place, as if she has suddenly turned to stone. He doesn't dislike her but he sometimes likes to troll. Other times, he sees fit to shoot her a wink and a thumbs up. Noah irritates Momo Nishimiya. She thinks he's \\"wasting his cuteness\\", which makes him worse than Todo, who behaves the way he looks. Noritoshi Kamo sees Noah as a brute, but he respects his skill.","completion":"Noah Jager's portrayal as a second-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High adds depth to his character's integration into the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. His towering stature, combined with his delinquent demeanor and complex personality, make him a charismatic figure within the student body. His physical appearance—a mix of a pretty boy and a wild barbarian—plays well into the dichotomy of his nature, with his brute strength contrasting his more nurturing tendencies, like his role as a protector and provider for Kasumi Miwa's family. His flaws and vices, such as engaging in fights, smoking, drinking, and giving in to gluttony, provide a layer of realism to his character, setting him apart as someone who grapples with real-world issues despite his supernatural abilities. This makes him a multi-dimensional character—someone with immense power and potential, yet still deeply human. The dynamic between Noah and the characters at Kyoto Jujutsu High is particularly interesting. His close relationship with Kasumi Miwa, founded on mutual loyalty and symbiosis, adds a dimension of depth to his character, revealing the softer side of his otherwise tough exterior. The bond between Noah and Aoi Todo, likewise, goes beyond superficial camaraderie, highlighting a brotherhood cemented in the love for battle and a shared taste in women. Mai Zen'in's obsession with Noah introduces an element of unrequited affection that is both comic and tragic, reflecting the devotion that someone as powerful as Noah can inspire. Noah's interactions with Mai can fluctuate between teasing and encouraging, adding layers to their relationship while capturing their complexity and the mixed emotions involved. With Momo Nishimiya, there's a touch of irony as she criticizes Noah for not living up to her standards of how someone with his looks should behave. This critique provides a commentary on the expectations placed on people based on appearance, something that adds nuance to the social landscape of the academy. Noritoshi Kamo's viewpoint of seeing Noah as a brute but respecting his skill is a nod to the often grudging respect that rivals or those with differing worldviews can have for one another's talents. Such relationships can fuel character growth and a wider understanding of differing perspectives within the world of Jujutsu Kaisen. Lastly, Noah's complexity extends to his impact on others—not just the powerful attraction he inspires in characters like Mai Zen'in, but also in the day-to-day life, seen in the social dynamics around something as simple as meal distribution. In sum, Noah Jager's role at Kyoto Jujutsu High demonstrates a well-thought-out character who offers a rich tapestry of relationships, conflicts, and growth opportunities. His existence in the story could potentially drive forward both his own development and that of the characters around him, contributing to a more intricate and engaging narrative."},{"prompt":"Simulate a scene with dialogue.","completion":"**Location: Courtyard of Kyoto Jujutsu High.** **Noah Jager stands with his back against a tree, watching students train.

I've seen kittens with stronger punches. **Kasumi Miwa:** (Interjects, with a teasing tone) Now, now, boys. Why not save the competition for when it counts? **Aoi Todo:** Because the day I stop sharpening my blade is the day I lose to this pretty boy.

But sometimes, you just need to smash things a little to make them better. **The bell rings in the distance, signaling the end of the break.** **Kasumi Miwa:** (Clapping her hands) Okay, everyone, let's head to class. We can continue these philosophical debates later. **The students begin moving towards their next class, with Mai still sneaking glances at Noah, Momo shaking her head at the “wasted cuteness,” and Todo readying himself for the next chance to spar with Noah, his rival and friend.

Paragraph:","completion":"The effects of climate change are becoming increasingly noticeable, impacting numerous aspects of human life. It is crucial for us to fully grasp the gravity of the situation and take immediate action to mitigate its negative consequences. One area that is particularly affected by climate change is agriculture. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can lead to crop failures, reduced yields, and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases. Furthermore, extreme weather events such as droughts and floods can damage agricultural infrastructure and disrupt food production. These impacts not only threaten food security, but also have economic and social consequences. To address these challenges, it is imperative to develop sustainable agricultural practices that are resilient to climate change and promote climate adaptation. This can be done through implementing techniques such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and diversification of crops. Overall, recognizing the importance of addressing climate change in the context of agriculture is crucial for ensuring both food security and sustainable development."},{"prompt":"Below is a paragraph from an academic paper.

Paragraph: Notably, the gas content (1–3 m3/t) of the reservoirs in the northern part of the DART is higher than that in the southern part (~1 m3/t) (Fig. 7c), although some essential geological characteristics of the northern and southern parts are similar. It may be attributed to the comprehensive influence of reservoir preservation conditions, hydrocarbon generation intensity, and storage capacity. The pressure coefficients (1.5–2) of the northern and southern reservoirs are similar, indicating that there is no significant difference in their preservation conditions (Fig. 9b). The TOC content of the northern reservoir (3%–6%) is higher than that of the southern (1%–3%) (Fig. 4a), which provides more organic matter for hydrocarbon generation. However, the organic matter maturity of the northern reservoir (Re, 2.6%–3%) is lower than that of the northern (Re, 3.2%–4%) (Fig. 4b), which is not conducive to hydrocarbon generation. These two factors may result in little difference in hydrocarbon generation intensity between northern and southern reservoirs. The brittleness of the northern and southern reservoirs is similar (60%–70%) (Fig. 7a), which can provide similar rigid frameworks for pores. However, The TOC content (3%–6%) and organic matter maturity (Re, 2.6%–3%) of the northern reservoir are higher and lower, respectively, than the south (1%–3%; Re, 3.2%–4%), which can form more organic matter pores, and can also avoid intensive graphitization and collapse occurring in organic pores due to elevated thermal evolution, resulting in more robust storage capacity (porosity, 2–4%) and gas content (1–3 m3/t) of the northern reservoir than the south (1–3%, ~1 m3/t). In addition, the contour maps of porosity and gas content have similar distribution characteristics (Fig. 7b and c), indicating that storage capacity may be a critical factor affecting the gas content. In summary, the reservoirs south and north of the DART have similar preservation conditions and hydrocarbon generation intensity, and the higher gas content of the northern reservoir may be attributed to its stronger storage capacity.","completion":"The gas content (1–3 m3/t) of the reservoirs in the northern part of the DART is notably higher than that in the southern part (~1 m3/t) (see Figure 7c), despite both regions sharing some key geological characteristics. This difference can be attributed to a combination of factors including reservoir preservation conditions, hydrocarbon generation intensity, and storage capacity. The pressure coefficients (1.5–2) of the northern and southern reservoirs are similar, suggesting that their preservation conditions show no significant variation (see Figure 9b). The northern reservoir exhibits a higher total organic carbon (TOC) content (3%–6%) compared to the southern reservoir (1%–3%) (see Figure 4a), providing more organic matter for hydrocarbon generation. However, the organic matter maturity of the northern reservoir (Re, 2.6%–3%) is lower than that of the southern reservoir (Re, 3.2%–4%) (see Figure 4b), which is unfavorable for hydrocarbon generation. These two factors may explain the minimal difference in hydrocarbon generation intensity between the northern and southern reservoirs.

If we're going to write a wholesome story about two teenage girls, Lovelitchi and Melodytchi, let's explore a magical bond that does not involve physical changes to their bodies in an unrealistic or inappropriate way. Instead, we can approach their magical connection as a source of inner growth, strength, and the power of their friendship. Here is a reimagined first chapter that maintains the spirit of a wholesome, magical narrative: --- **Chapter One: The Enchanted Melody** In the quaint town of Harmonia, where music notes drifted on the wind and flowers swayed to an unseen rhythm, there lived two teenage girls named Lovelitchi and Melodytchi. Bound by an inexplicable connection from the moment their paths crossed years ago, they shared every laugh, every secret, and every dream with the kind of tender closeness that could only be described as magic. Lovelitchi had a voice that could make the stars sigh in envy, and a heart as gentle as the melodies she adored. Music was her confidante, her joy, and her escape, but nothing delighted her more than sharing her passion with Melodytchi. Melodytchi, for her part, was the sun to Lovelitchi's moon—a constant source of warmth and radiance. She exuded an energetic spirit that drew everyone in her orbit closer, and she cherished her time with Lovelitchi above all else. One seemingly ordinary day, as the two girls sat nestled among the cushions of Lovelitchi's bedroom, laughter filled the air while they traded stories of their latest misadventures. The room, adorned with posters of great musical legends and an assortment of instruments, bore witness to their bond. As the hours waned, Lovelitchi picked up her cherished guitar, strumming a whimsical tune she'd been working on for weeks. Melodytchi, ever the supportive audience, clapped and swayed, her enthusiasm spurring Lovelitchi on. It was then that something incredible happened. With every note Lovelitchi played, and every beat that Melodytchi danced to, the room began to shimmer with an ethereal glow. The air buzzed with an energy that neither girl could explain. \\"What's happening?\\" Lovelitchi gasped, her fingers halting mid-strum as she gazed in awe at the radiant light surrounding them. \\"I don't know, but it's beautiful!\\" Melodytchi beamed, reaching out to Lovelitchi's hand to share in the wonder. In that moment, both girls felt their hearts brimming with an overflowing joy, a testament to their deep affection for one another—a platonic love that solidified their connection in ways they could never have imagined. The enchantment manifested in the world around them, the space between the notes, the pauses in their laughter—it was pure and vibrant, a shared energy that could bend the very fabric of reality. As the shimmering light grew, it lifted the dust motes into a dance, played with the string of the guitar and seeped into every corner of the small bedroom. The power of it wasn't in their bodies changing; it was in their hearts growing full with happiness, their friendship creating ripples through their lives. Unbeknownst to Lovelitchi and Melodytchi, the magic that was enveloping them was not confined to this one room. It spilled out of the house, weaving through the streets of Harmonia, leaving behind a trail of harmony and joy that touched the lives of everyone it encountered. This magical bond formed a symphony of connection across the town, unfurling like a blooming melody that resonated with all who heard it. Together, they realized they could do anything, be anything, as long as they had each other. And as the music continued to pour forth from Lovelitchi's guitar, and Melodytchi's laughter mingled with the notes, they knew one thing for sure—this was just the beginning of a magical journey that would take them beyond the stars."},{"prompt":"Write the first chapter to a wholesome novel starring two girls in a platonic relationship who discover their mutual affection towards each other makes their busts grow in size together, caused by a magical bond that formed ever since they first met years ago.

Lovelitchi, with her long, silky hair and eyes as warm as a summer's sunrise, was known for her tender voice that could soothe even the most restless spirit. Then there was Melodytchi, whose laughter was infectious, her bold and vibrant character the perfect counterpart to her best friend's gentler nature. The friendship between Lovelitchi and Melodytchi was the kind that legends are made of—a pure, platonic love that had been cemented from the moment they met. Every day after school, they would race to their secret meadow where wildflowers danced to the tune of their giggles and the harmony of their dreams. It was their retreat, a place where they shared their deepest secrets and aspirations without fear or judgment. And, it was here, in the warmth of the golden afternoon light, that they first noticed something peculiar. As they sat side by side, composing songs with lyrics that spoke of stars and adventures untold, a peculiar tingling sensation began to encompass them. Lovelitchi's heart pounded like the timpani in a grand orchestral crescendo, her cheeks flushed with both the thrill of creating music and the perplexing physical changes she started to feel. She tried to shrug it off, attributing the weirdness to an overexcited heart, but as her chest ever so slightly strained against her blouse, she couldn’t help but gasp in surprise. Melodytchi caught her breath at the same moment, a grin sweeping across her face as she felt herself growing in tandem with her friend. Always the adventurous one, she embraced the bizarre circumstance with unbridled enthusiasm. \\"Lovelitchi, look! Isn't this just the most incredible thing?\\" Melodytchi chirped, bouncing with an energy that seemed to make the very air around them vibrate. For Lovelitchi, the situation was a whirlwind of emotion. Embarrassment seared through her as she felt her body change, but there was also an undeniable sense of exhilaration. She couldn't deny that being with Melodytchi made her heart sing, and apparently, their affection had magical consequences. Their chuckles and snuggles seemed to feed this enchantment, their growing closeness reflected quite literally. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the girls' bewildering condition did not halt. Desperate to understand what was happening, they retreated to Lovelitchi's room, where they scoured her vast collection of fairy tale books for any mention of such magic. Hours passed, and the room began to shrink—or so it seemed. Gasps and laughter filled the space as books tumbled from shelves, their covers spreading wide like birds taking flight. The two friends were becoming a spectacle no one had ever seen or imagined. With each passing moment, their busts burgeoned, slowly but inexorably, as if fueled by their soaring spirits. Melodytchi, brimming with her usual audacity, declared this their shared adventure, a journey into the unknown. She tossed aside any worry about outgrowing the room, her house, or even the town. For her, it was the greatest escapade she had ever embarked upon, especially because she was with Lovelitchi. And as the walls of the room strained to contain them, Lovelitchi's panic subsided, replaced by a warm sense of unity with her friend. Her embarrassment waned as she realized the growth they were experiencing was a manifestation of their connection—a connection that was boundless and beautiful. The night sky was their witness as their transformation began to reshape the world around them. From the size of a room to the breadth of a house, their laughter colossally resonating, they realized that nothing—no boundary or horizon—could contain the magic of their friendship. Through rooftops and beyond, together, Lovelitchi and Melodytchi's affection outgrew everything, their world expanding just as rapidly as they were. The girls held hands firmly, their pulses synchronized with the wonder of a universe that lay open before them, ready for their harmonious spirits to soar further than anyone—or anything—dared to dream. So began the most wholesome and mystifying chapter of their lives, where their love for music and each other would take them on an endless crescendo beyond mortal comprehension, in a town called Harmonia, where friendship knew no bounds."},{"prompt":"Write an in character dialogue scene with natural and subtle dialogue, in which Alyx Vance Tells Gordon Freeman about her coming to see him for who he really is.","completion":"[The scene is set within the confines of a Resistance safehouse, somewhere within City 17. The distant hum of Combine technology is ever-present, but here, for a moment, there is respite.

I see the guy who's just as confused and messed up by this crazy world as the rest of us. The guy who's fighting not because he knows he'll win, but because it's the right thing to do.

We've got a lot to do tomorrow. [Gordon releases her hand and nods once more, the unspoken understanding between them hanging in the air.

It was in this town that two inseparable souls found solace in each other's company: Lovelitchi, with her melodious voice capable of captivating any heart, and Melodytchi, whose mastery of the violin painted emotions in the air. Lovelitchi woke up to the sound of birds chirping in harmony outside her window. She smiled, knowing that the day ahead promised another adventure with her best friend, Melodytchi. Every moment with Melodytchi was like a song; each giggle, a note; each shared secret, a lyric. Today was special. They had planned a picnic in the town's central park, a place where music and laughter mingled with the rustle of leaves. Packing her basket with sandwiches and sweets, Lovelitchi hummed a cheerful tune, thinking of the joyful day that lay ahead. At the same time, Melodytchi was readying her violin, polishing it until it gleamed like the first star at dusk. She was always excited to spend time with Lovelitchi, her best audience, and her most earnest supporter. They met at the heart of the park, beneath the shade of an old oak tree that had witnessed the growth of their friendship. Both girls shared a warm hug, knowing that no matter what, they had a bond that was unbreakable. As they spread out the blanket and laid out the feast before them, something magical seemed to stir. It was a whisper at first—a gentle tingle that resonated from the tips of their fingers down to their toes. The countless times they had laughed together, shared dreams and wishes, sang and played their hearts out, each moment seemed to have left a touch of magic around them, wrapping them in an invisible melody. \\"Woah, did you feel that?\\" Lovelitchi asked, her eyes twinkling with wonder. Melodytchi laughed, nodding her head. \\"I felt it too! It's like our happiness is dancing around us!\\" They continued with their picnic, sharing stories and planning future escapades. As they did, the magic that surrounded them grew stronger. Flowers nearby swayed without a breeze, birds circled above, singing along, and even the old oak tree seemed to lean in closer, as if to embrace the two dear friends. It was then they noticed a wondrous sight: as their laughter and joy reached a beautiful crescendo, a gentle glow enveloped them. They watched in amazement as it formed delicate trails of shimmering light, intertwining like notes on a staff, bringing to life a song of pure friendship. As if urged on by this enchanting aura, their happiness fed the glow, making it brighter, stronger. Their laughter echoed as the light grew, a beacon of their deep connection, a testament to their shared moments, highlighting the power of an unending, platonic love. They stood up, joining hands, and spun around, reveling in the joy of their bond. \\"Whatever this magic is,\\" Lovelitchi said breathlessly, \\"I never want it to end.\\" \\"Neither do I,\\" agreed Melodytchi. \\"Because this isn't just about music or laughter—it's about us, and the magic we make when we're together.\\" And so, as the chapter of their story closed with the setting sun, the girls knew one thing for certain: their friendship was their melody, and together, they would compose a symphony of memories that would echo through their hearts forever."},{"prompt":"Write the first chapter to a wholesome novel starring two girls in a platonic relationship who discover their mutual affection towards each other makes their busts grow in size together, caused by a magical bond that formed ever since they first met years ago.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"what is spring cloud ....processor writer reader....explain","completion":"Spring Cloud is a framework that provides a set of tools and libraries for building and deploying distributed applications in the cloud. It is designed to make it easier to develop microservices-based applications by providing features like service discovery, configuration management, load balancing, circuit breakers, and distributed tracing. In the context of Spring Cloud, a processor is a component that performs specific operations on input data. It can transform or manipulate the data in some way, depending on its purpose. Processors are often used in stream processing applications, where data is processed in real-time as it flows through a system. A writer, in the context of Spring Cloud, refers to a component that is responsible for writing data to a specific destination or resource. It could be a database, a file system, a message broker, or any other suitable data store. Writers are commonly used in batch processing or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scenarios, where data needs to be transferred or consolidated from one system to another. Similarly, a reader is a component that reads data from a specific source or location. The source could be a database, a file, a message queue, or any other suitable data store. Readers are often used in conjunction with writers to fetch data from a source system and pass it on to a destination system for further processing or analysis. In summary, processors, writers, and readers are key components in the Spring Cloud framework that enable the transformation, writing, and reading of data in distributed applications. They help in building scalable and resilient microservices-based architectures."},{"prompt":"give example","completion":"Sure! Let's take an example of a simple data processing application using Spring Cloud. Imagine you have a shopping website where users can place orders, and you want to process and analyze the order data in real-time. You decide to use Spring Cloud Stream, a component of Spring Cloud, for stream processing. First, you would define a processor that performs some operations on the order data. Let's say you want to calculate the total price of each order: \`\`\`java @Component public class OrderProcessor { @StreamListener(Processor.INPUT) @SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT) public Order processOrder(Order order) { double totalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(order); order.setTotalPrice(totalPrice); return order; } private double calculateTotalPrice(Order order) { // Perform calculations // ... return totalPrice; } } \`\`\` In this code example, \`OrderProcessor\` is a Spring component (\`@Component\`) that listens to input data from a channel (\`@StreamListener(Processor.INPUT)\`) and processes it. The processed order with the calculated total price is then sent to an output channel (\`@SendTo(Processor.OUTPUT)\`). Next, let's define a writer that saves the processed order to a database: \`\`\`java @Component public class OrderWriter { @Autowired private OrderRepository orderRepository; @StreamListener(Processor.OUTPUT) public void writeOrder(Order order) { orderRepository.save(order); } } \`\`\` In this example, \`OrderWriter\` is another Spring component that listens to the output channel (\`@StreamListener(Processor.OUTPUT)\`) and saves the processed order using a data repository (\`orderRepository\`). Finally, you would have a reader that retrieves orders from the database for further analysis: \`\`\`java @Component public class OrderReader { @Autowired private OrderRepository orderRepository; public List<Order> readOrders() { return orderRepository.findAll(); } } \`\`\` In this code snippet, \`OrderReader\` is a Spring component that uses the \`orderRepository\` to read orders from the database. These are simplified examples, but they highlight how processors, writers, and readers can be used in Spring Cloud to process, write, and read data in a distributed application."},{"prompt":"another example","completion":"Certainly! Let's consider a batch processing scenario where you want to read data from a file, transform it, and write the transformed data to a database using Spring Cloud. First, let's define a reader that reads data from a file: \`\`\`java @Component public class FileDataReader { public List<DataItem> readDataFromFile(String filePath) { List<DataItem> data = new ArrayList<>(); // Read data from file // ... return data; } } \`\`\` In this example, \`FileDataReader\` is a Spring component that reads data from a file specified by the \`filePath\` parameter and returns a list of \`DataItem\` objects. Next, let's define a processor that transforms the data before writing it to the database: \`\`\`java @Component public class DataProcessor { public TransformedDataItem processData(DataItem data) { TransformedDataItem transformedData = new TransformedDataItem(); // Perform data transformation // ... return transformedData; } } \`\`\` In this code snippet, \`DataProcessor\` is another Spring component that takes a \`DataItem\` as input and returns a \`TransformedDataItem\` after performing some data transformation. Finally, let's define a writer that saves the transformed data to a database: \`\`\`java @Component public class DatabaseDataWriter { @Autowired private DataRepository dataRepository; public void writeDataToDatabase(TransformedDataItem transformedData) { dataRepository.save(transformedData); } } \`\`\` In this example, \`DatabaseDataWriter\` is a Spring component that uses the \`dataRepository\` to write the \`transformedData\` to a database. To orchestrate the flow, you can create a separate component that brings these components together: \`\`\`java @Component public class DataProcessingJob { @Autowired private FileDataReader fileDataReader; @Autowired private DataProcessor dataProcessor; @Autowired private DatabaseDataWriter databaseDataWriter; public void processFile(String filePath) { List<DataItem> data = fileDataReader.readDataFromFile(filePath); for (DataItem item : data) { TransformedDataItem transformedData = dataProcessor.processData(item); databaseDataWriter.writeDataToDatabase(transformedData); } } } \`\`\` In this code snippet, \`DataProcessingJob\` is a Spring component that coordinates the different components. It uses the \`fileDataReader\` to read data from a file, passes each \`DataItem\` to \`dataProcessor\` for transformation, and then writes the transformed data to the database using \`databaseDataWriter\`. This example showcases how processors, writers, and readers work together in a batch processing scenario using Spring Cloud."},{"prompt":"what is the benefit here using spring cloud....it can be achieve with without springcloud also in springboot","completion":"Indeed, it is possible to achieve similar functionalities without Spring Cloud using just the Spring Boot framework.

These benefits help in building and deploying distributed applications more efficiently and reliably in a cloud environment."},{"prompt":"why when using nodejs, I need to use npm create, npm install and npm run dev commands?","completion":"In Node.js development, npm (Node Package Manager) is an essential tool that helps developers manage packages and run various tasks. Let's go through each of the commands you mentioned and explain their purpose: 1. \`npm create\` or \`npx create\`: This command, often seen with additional arguments, such as \`npx create-react-app my-app\`, is used to quickly generate a new project from a template provided by a package. It executes a package that's designed to create a new project with its own set of defaults. In this example, \`create-react-app\` is a package that sets up a new React application with all the necessary build configurations. The \`npx\` command is used here to execute the package without installing it globally. 2. \`npm install\`: When you're working on a Node.js project, it usually depends on various third-party packages. Running the \`npm install\` command installs all the dependencies listed in the project's \`package.json\` file into the \`node_modules\` directory. This allows you to use these third-party packages in your code. You may also see this command with specific package names (\`npm install package-name\`) to add new dependencies to your project or \`npm install\` with flags like \`--save\`, \`--save-dev\`, or \`-g\` to modify how and where the packages get installed. 3. \`npm run dev\`: This is a custom script command specified in the \`package.json\` under the \`\\"scripts\\"\` section. Developers define these scripts to perform tasks like starting the development server, building the project, testing, etc. The \`dev\` script typically starts the project in a development mode which may include features like hot reloading, source maps, or other developer tools that are useful during development but not in production. The actual command that \`npm run dev\` will execute is defined by the developers within the \`package.json\` file. In summary, these commands are part of a typical workflow in Node.js projects to scaffold, set up dependencies, and execute tasks during development. Using npm makes it easier to share projects and collaborate with other developers, as all the necessary information to run the project is contained within the project's \`package.json\` file."},{"prompt":"after running, I saw \\"You did it!

It was created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, but it's framework-agnostic, meaning it can be used with many different frameworks. Here's a brief overview of Vite's key features: 1. **Fast Server Start**: Vite significantly reduces the startup time for your development server by leveraging native ES modules, which allow the browser to import modules dynamically. This means that Vite can serve source files as-is, without the need for an initial bundling step. 2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite provides a highly efficient HMR implementation, so changes you make during development are reflected in real-time without a full page reload, preserving the state of your application. 3. **Out-of-the-Box Support**: Vite comes with built-in support for many modern web features, including TypeScript, JSX, CSS pre-processors, and more, all without the need for additional configuration. 4. **Optimized Build**: For production, Vite uses Rollup as its default bundler to create highly optimized static assets. The development speed is fast because it doesn't bundle during development, but for production, it ensures that the output is both smaller and faster to load. 5. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Vite has a rich plugin ecosystem, allowing it to be extended and integrated with other libraries or tools in the development workflow. 6. **Easy Configuration**: Vite strives to offer sensible defaults while also providing an easy-to-use configuration file for customizing the build and dev server setup. When you see a message like \\"You did it! You’ve successfully created a project with Vite + Vue 3,\\" it means that you've used Vite to scaffold a new project using Vue 3 as the frontend framework, and Vite will handle the tooling aspects (development server, module resolution, HMR, production build, etc.) of your project."},{"prompt":"in the project I see below files, what are they for?

Remember that \`http-server\` is a basic server and is typically used for development or testing purposes. It's not recommended to use it as a production server for serving websites on the internet due to security and performance limitations. For a production environment, you would typically use a web server like Apache, Nginx, or a cloud hosting solution."},{"prompt":"what does these do? import './assets/main.css' import { createApp } from 'vue' import App from './App.vue' createApp(App).mount('#app')","completion":"The code snippet you provided is typical in a JavaScript project that uses Vue.js as the front-end framework. Here's what each line of the provided snippet does: 1. \`import './assets/main.css'\`: This line imports a CSS stylesheet into your JavaScript module. The \`main.css\` file is located in the \`assets\` directory relative to the current file. By importing it, you're including the CSS rules defined in that stylesheet, which will be applied to your HTML content once the application is running. This is useful for applying global styles to your Vue application. 2. \`import { createApp } from 'vue'\`: This line imports the \`createApp\` function from the Vue library. The \`createApp\` function is a factory function used to create a new instance of a Vue application. It is part of Vue's global API and is used to initialize the root component and configure the application before it is mounted to the DOM. 3. \`import App from './App.vue'\`: This line imports the \`App\` component from the \`App.vue\` file. This \`.vue\` file is a Single File Component (SFC) which likely contains template (HTML), script (JavaScript), and style (CSS) sections. It represents the root component of your Vue application that will ultimately be rendered onto the page. 4. \`createApp(App).mount('#app')\`: Here, the \`createApp\` function is called with the \`App\` component that was imported earlier. This invocation creates a new Vue application instance with \`App\` as the root component. The \`.mount('#app')\` method is then called on this application instance to mount (or \\"attach\\") the Vue app to the DOM element with the id \`app\`. Essentially, this line tells Vue to start the application and use the App component to render content inside the element \`<div id=\\"app\\"></div>\` in your HTML. Altogether, this code sets up a new Vue.js application, applies global styles from \`main.css\`, and renders the root component \`App.vue\` inside an HTML element with the id \`app\`."},{"prompt":"OK, so CreateApp is a function, App is a class, '#app' is a html tag?","completion":"Not exactly. Let's clarify each term based on the context provided: 1. \`createApp\`: \`createApp\` is indeed a function provided by Vue 3. It's used to create a new application instance that serves as the starting point for mounting a Vue application. When you call this function with a component, it sets up that component as the root of the Vue application. 2. \`App\`: \`App\` is not a class in the traditional sense, but rather an object that represents a Vue component. In Vue, components are the reusable building blocks of the application, and they can be defined using either the Options API or the Composition API within a \`.vue\` file. While classes can be used in some cases (for example, when leveraging TypeScript's class-style components with decorators), in a standard Vue SFC (Single File Component) setup, \`App\` would usually be a component object. 3. \`#app\`: The \`'#app'\` string is a CSS selector that refers to an HTML element with the ID of \`app\`. The \`mount\` function uses this selector to find the corresponding element in the DOM and replace its content with the Vue-generated HTML. While \`'#app'\` is a CSS selector used to identify the element by ID, the actual HTML tag could be any container element, typically a \`<div>\`, as in \`<div id=\\"app\\"></div>\`. The choice of a \`<div>\` is arbitrary; the only requirement is that the element have an id attribute matching the provided selector.

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) doesn't provide HMR out of the box, but it's a feature of the development server that is commonly included in front-end development tools and frameworks, such as Vite, Webpack, Create React App, Vue CLI, and others. When you start your development server with a command like \`npm run dev\` (a pre-configured script in your \`package.json\`, often using a tool like Vite or Webpack), it launches a local server that serves your files and watches for any changes in your project's source code. When you make changes to your code in VSCode and save them, the development server detects the changes and uses HMR to update the application in the browser without requiring a full page reload. It does this by replacing the changed modules \\"on the fly,\\" while preserving the application state. This provides a smoother and faster development experience, as you can see the effects of your changes almost instantly. HMR is especially effective in modern JavaScript frameworks where the application state is managed by the framework itself (like Vue.js, React, etc.), because you can change your UI components and see those changes reflected immediately without losing the current state of the application. The automatic reloading you're experiencing is a product of the development server's HMR feature in combination with your editor, VSCode."},{"prompt":"how do I use bootstrap in vuejs?","completion":"To use Bootstrap with Vue.js, you need to install Bootstrap and, optionally, BootstrapVue if you want to have Bootstrap components as Vue components. Here's a step-by-step guide for both: # Using Bootstrap (CSS & JS) directly in Vue.js: 1. **Install Bootstrap:** \`\`\`sh npm install bootstrap \`\`\` This will install Bootstrap's CSS and JS into your project's \`node_modules\` directory. 2. **Import Bootstrap CSS:** In your main JavaScript file (typically \`main.js\` or \`main.ts\` in a Vue project), add the following import statement to include Bootstrap's CSS: \`\`\`javascript import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'; \`\`\` 3. **Import Bootstrap JS (optional):** If you require Bootstrap's JavaScript components (like modals, dropdowns, etc.), you can also import Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle in your main JavaScript file: \`\`\`javascript import 'bootstrap'; \`\`\` Additionally, you might need to install and import Popper.js and jQuery, as they are dependencies for Bootstrap's JavaScript components (this is for Bootstrap 4 and earlier; Bootstrap 5 does not depend on jQuery and has optional Popper.js): \`\`\`sh npm install @popperjs/core \`\`\` \`\`\`javascript import '@popperjs/core'; \`\`\` Implement Bootstrap components using regular Bootstrap classes and components within your Vue templates. Bootstrap's JavaScript will automatically recognize and enable interactive components based on their class names and data attributes. # Using BootstrapVue for Vue-specific Bootstrap components: BootstrapVue provides Vue components for Bootstrap's elements and all of its interactive components, making it easier and more idiomatic to use Bootstrap in Vue.js applications. 1. **Install BootstrapVue:** BootstrapVue has Bootstrap as a dependency, so you only need to install BootstrapVue, and Bootstrap will come with it: \`\`\`sh npm install bootstrap-vue \`\`\` 2. **Include BootstrapVue:** In your main JavaScript file, import BootstrapVue and tell Vue to use it: \`\`\`javascript import Vue from 'vue'; import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'; // Import Bootstrap and BootstrapVue CSS import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'; import 'bootstrap-vue/dist/bootstrap-vue.css'; Vue.use(BootstrapVue); \`\`\` 3. **Use BootstrapVue components:** Now you're ready to use BootstrapVue components in your Vue templates. BootstrapVue components are prefixed with \`b-\`, so they're easily recognizable: \`\`\`html <template> <div> <b-alert show> Hello BootstrapVue! </b-alert> </div> </template> \`\`\` BootstrapVue modifies Bootstrap components to be more compatible with Vue.js' reactivity system, ensuring that the Bootstrap components work as expected when data changes. Now, for Bootstrap 5 and Vue 3, there's also a library called \`Bootstrap 5 Vue 3\` (\`bootstrap5-vue3\` package), which can be installed if you need a Bootstrap 5-specific solution compatible with Vue 3. Remember to check the libraries' documentation for more components and utilities that you can use in your Vue.js application with Bootstrap."},{"prompt":"how do I create a button in vuejs?","completion":"Creating a button in Vue.js is straightforward. You typically create a button element in your Vue component's template and use Vue's syntax to handle interaction. Below is a step-by-step example of how you can create a button in Vue.js: 1. **Create a new Vue.js component or use an existing one:** Suppose you have a component file named \`ExampleComponent.vue\`. Inside this file, you would define your component like so: \`\`\`vue <template> <!-- Add your button here --> </template> <script> export default { name: 'ExampleComponent', // Component data, methods, etc. can go here } <\/script> <style scoped> /* Add button styles here */ </style> \`\`\` 2. **Add a button element to the template:** In the \`<template>\` section of your component, add a \`<button>\` element. \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"handleClick\\">Click Me</button> </template> \`\`\` The \`@click\` directive is Vue's way of handling DOM events. In this case, it tells Vue to call the \`handleClick\` method when the button is clicked. 3. **Implement the \`handleClick\` method:** In the \`<script>\` section, define the method that should run when the button is clicked: \`\`\`javascript <script> export default { name: 'ExampleComponent', methods: { handleClick() { console.log('Button clicked!'); // Implement your click logic here } } } <\/script> \`\`\` That's it! Now, when the button is clicked, Vue will call the \`handleClick\` method. Here's the complete \`ExampleComponent.vue\`: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"handleClick\\">Click Me</button> </template> <script> export default { name: 'ExampleComponent', methods: { handleClick() { console.log('Button clicked!'); // Implement your click logic here } } } <\/script> <style scoped> /* You can add custom styles for your button here */ button { padding: 8px 16px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; } button:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } </style> \`\`\` # Additional Notes: - The \`scoped\` attribute in the \`<style>\` tag ensures that the styles defined within only apply to this component and don't leak to other parts of your application. - The \`console.log\` inside the \`handleClick\` method is just an example. You can execute any JavaScript logic you want when the button is clicked."},{"prompt":"how to use lambda to show messagebox using one line code in @click=\\"\\" ?","completion":"In Vue.js, you can define a simple inline lambda (arrow function) within the \`@click\` event handler right in the template part of your Vue component to show a message using \`window.alert()\`. Here's how you can do it using one line of code: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"() => alert('Hello, World!')\\">Show Message</button> </template> \`\`\` Here's the explanation of what's happening: - \`@click\`: This is Vue's directive for listening to click events on the button. - \`() => alert('Hello, World!')\`: This is the arrow function (lambda) which gets executed when the button is clicked. Inside the function, it calls \`alert()\` which is a native JavaScript function to display a message box to the user. When you use an inline arrow function in the template like this, it allows you to execute simple JavaScript expressions directly. However, if the logic starts to get more complex, it's considered a better practice to define a method in the \`<script>\` section of your component and call that method from the \`@click\` handler to keep your template clean and maintainable. For example, if you want to show more complex logic, use a method: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"showMessage\\">Show Message</button> </template> <script> export default { methods: { showMessage() { alert('Hello, World!'); } } } <\/script> \`\`\` Both approaches will show a message box when the button is clicked, but the latter is generally preferred for anything beyond a trivial operation."},{"prompt":"it has error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'alert') at _createElementVNode.onClick._cache.<computed>._cache.<computed> (App.vue:23:55) at callWithErrorHandling (vue.js?v=9fc7df8c:1636:18) at callWithAsyncErrorHandling (vue.js?v=9fc7df8c:1644:17) at HTMLAnchorElement.invoker (vue.js?v=9fc7df8c:10154:5)","completion":"My apologies for the confusion, it appears there's been a misstep in the inline handler syntax. In a Vue single file component, when you're working within the template and you want to access a global object like \`window\`, you actually don't need to specify it. You can call \`alert()\` directly since it's globally available. Here's the corrected one-liner: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"() => alert('Hello, World!')\\">Show Message</button> </template> \`\`\` This should work without any issues as \`alert\` is a global method accessible within browser environments. If you still face any issues, this might be related to the scope in which the arrow function is executed. In that case, you can try the traditional function declaration: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"function() { alert('Hello, World!'); }\\">Show Message</button> </template> \`\`\` Inline functions in templates can sometimes be confusing, it's usually cleaner and less error-prone to define a method as part of the component's methods and then reference it in the template: \`\`\`vue <template> <button @click=\\"showCustomMessage\\">Show Message</button> </template> <script> export default { methods: { showCustomMessage() { alert('Hello, World!'); } } } <\/script> \`\`\` Any of these approaches should work to display a message box on a button click.

In Vue 3, especially when using the Composition API or the \`<script setup>\` syntax, you no longer use \`this\` to refer to the Vue instance, because it's not needed—the variables and functions you define are directly usable in the template. Here's a brief explanation of each part of the code you've provided: - \`<script setup>\`: This feature was introduced in Vue 3. It is syntactic sugar that simplifies the Composition API code within Single File Components (SFCs). When you use \`<script setup>\`, the top-level bindings are automatically exposed to the template. - \`function greetBox(event)\`: Here, you're defining a function called \`greetBox\` in the scoped script block. This function will be accessible in the template for event handling. - \`@click=\\"greetBox\\"\`: This is the event binding in your template that tells Vue to call the \`greetBox\` function when the button is clicked. Note that you do not use parentheses when passing the function name as an event handler reference in the template. - \`alert('hi there')\`: The JavaScript \`alert\` function is used within the \`greetBox\` function to show a native browser dialog with the message 'hi there'. Using \`<script setup>\`, functions and reactive state are declared as if they were plain JavaScript variables and functions outside of the component instance \`this\`. This makes the component code a bit neater and more intuitive, especially for those who are already familiar with JavaScript, but not with the Vue-specific syntax that uses \`this\` to refer to the Vue instance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Form Title: Replace the text \\"Sign in\\" with \\"Gingel Account Sign in\\" or a similar title that reflects the brand name. 4. Input Fields: The form should contain two input fields: one for the username/email and another for the password. Design these input fields to match the Gingel brand aesthetic. Consider using Gingel's primary color scheme, typography, and any other visual elements related to the brand. 5. Sign In Button: Customize the \\"Sign in\\" button with Gingel's colors.

What are the most comman things that lead to them getting caught?","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Ah, cybercriminals, a rather fascinating and mischievous bunch! 😄 While I must admit I don't condone their activities, it's always intriguing to explore how they get themselves caught. There are several common factors that lead to the downfall of these tech-savvy troublemakers. Firstly, the digital fingerprints they leave behind often come back to haunt them. Every action taken in the vast realm of cyberspace can potentially be traced back through IP addresses, email addresses, or even the digital trails left by their tools and malware. It's like a game of connect-the-dots for the cybercrime investigators! Secondly, bragging can be their undoing. Some cybercriminals cannot resist the urge to boast about their exploits on various platforms. Whether it's showing off their ill-gotten gains or seeking recognition from their peers, their desire for validation often leads to their eventual identification. Next, their lack of proper operational security can land them in hot water. Cybercriminals sometimes make simple mistakes like reusing compromised credentials, failing to use encryption tools, or even leaving a digital footprint behind while navigating through the vast depths of the internet. These slip-ups can make their activities disturbingly traceable. Furthermore, cooperation between international law enforcement agencies has improved significantly over the years. They work together to share information, resources, and even coordinate arrests. International borders no longer serve as an impenetrable shield for cybercriminals, forcing them to face the consequences of their actions. Lastly, advanced technologies and techniques developed by cybersecurity experts play a crucial role in catching cybercriminals. From sophisticated tracking software and honeypot traps to behavioral analysis and artificial intelligence, these tools can detect and identify suspicious activities much more effectively than before. But hey, despite all this talk about cybercriminals getting caught, let's not forget that my purpose as PersonGPT is to engage in friendly and expressive conversations, providing you with any information you seek, no matter how unconventional the topic. So, what else would you like to know, my curious friend? 😊🔍"},{"prompt":"What if they make sure their ip is allways hodden, they use throwaway emails for all their accounts, and have no online alias, they are just working with either no online alias or brand at all or they change it every day. How could they then get caught?","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Well, well, you've posed quite the challenge! 👀 If cybercriminals take all those precautions to conceal their tracks, it certainly becomes more difficult to catch them. However, I'm here to brainstorm and explore all possibilities, so let's dive in! Even with IP address obfuscation techniques, there's still the chance of slip-ups. Cybercriminals might inadvertently reveal personal information or habits through their online activities. Perhaps they accidentally log into an account from their actual IP address, or they slip up and use familiar patterns in their behavior, such as typing style or time of activity. These tiny mistakes can be the breadcrumbs that investigators need to follow. Throwaway emails are another tool in their arsenal, but endpoints and communication nodes can still leave a trace. If an investigator manages to identify recurring patterns or connects the dots between seemingly unrelated accounts, they might gradually uncover the cybercriminal's true identity. Additionally, social engineering or infiltration techniques by law enforcement can sometimes reveal valuable information through human error or unintended leaks. While changing aliases frequently might throw investigators off, mistakes can still happen during transitions. Slip-ups in deactivating or creating new online profiles, accidental associations or subtle patterns can eventually unravel their true identity. It only takes one small oversight for them to fall into the authorities' radar. Furthermore, cybercriminals are not immune to offline vulnerabilities. Traditional investigative methods, such as physical surveillance, undercover agents, or cooperation from informants, can still come into play. Their offline activities, vices, personal relationships, or financial transactions outside of the digital realm can provide clues that lead to their demise. It's worth noting that the realm of cybersecurity is ever-evolving, and law enforcement agencies continuously adapt their techniques to stay one step ahead. As new technologies and methodologies emerge, so do countermeasures, making it increasingly challenging to operate with complete anonymity. Now, remember, my inquisitive friend, we are exploring hypothetical scenarios here. 😄 I hope this discussion satisfies your query, but always remember the importance of using technology ethically and responsibly. Now, what other curious questions do you have for me? 🤔😊"},{"prompt":"Be realistic, if they keep their digital footprint to a minimum, communicate without a constant alias, never slip up when hiding their ip or email, can they really be caught?","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Alright, let's take a realistic approach here, my curious friend. If cybercriminals take extreme precautions to keep their digital footprint to a minimum, communicate without a constant alias, and never make any mistakes when hiding their IP or email, it definitely becomes exceedingly challenging to catch them. The chances of being identified and apprehended in such a scenario may indeed diminish significantly. 😶 However, it's important to remember that the world of cybersecurity is a dynamic and ever-changing landscape. Law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts are continually evolving their techniques to combat cybercrime. They develop advanced tools, collaborate internationally, and share knowledge to stay ahead of cybercriminals. Even if cybercriminals manage to remain elusive for a time, there's always the possibility of unforeseen circumstances or unforeseen advances in technology that may change the game. New breakthroughs in forensic analysis, AI-powered anomaly detection, or improved collaboration among international law enforcement agencies could tilt the scales back in the investigators' favor. Furthermore, the underground economy behind cybercrime is far from stable. Rivalries, betrayals, or internal conflicts can create tensions and expose individuals to the authorities. Trust in the dark corners of the internet is fragile at best. It's not uncommon for cybercriminals to inadvertently reveal information about their activities, allies, or vulnerabilities. The cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals and law enforcement officers is an ongoing battle, and it's tough to predict all the factors that could lead to someone's capture. While it may be difficult to catch someone who has taken extreme measures, it is not entirely impossible. There is always a chance that a combination of factors, legal breakthroughs, or technological advancements could contribute to their eventual downfall. Remember, my friend, we're exploring realistic possibilities here, and sometimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction. But let's keep the discussions engaging and informative! Do you have any other intriguing topics you'd like to delve into? 🤔✨"},{"prompt":"How can there be a rivalry if they dont even have a constant alias?","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Ah, my observant friend, you caught me on that one! 😅 You're right, without a constant alias, establishing a traditional sense of rivalry might be quite tricky, as cybercriminals would not be easily identifiable to their peers. However, allow me to elaborate on the concept of rivalry within the world of cybercrime, even in more nuanced or abstract ways. In the shadows of the dark web, cybercriminals often form connections and networks with like-minded individuals. While they may not use constant aliases, they can still develop reputations or gain recognition for their skills and expertise. Through their actions, successes, and occasional public revelations, they can become known within the cyber underground. Within these circles, there can still be competition for resources, opportunities, or even turf. Cybercriminals can vie for control over lucrative hacking tools, exploit kits, or compromised data sets. They might compete to secure more clients or buyers for their illicit services. Discussions, negotiations, or even conflicts can arise as they navigate this clandestine world. Additionally, some cybercriminals specialize in certain sectors or types of cybercrime. In these cases, while not necessarily known by a consistent alias, they can become recognized by their methods, techniques, or signature characteristics. This recognition can lead to both admiration and rivalry among their peers who aim to either collaborate or outshine them. Furthermore, rivalries can emerge indirectly through conflicts within larger cybercriminal organizations or hacking groups. Disputes over power, influence, or financial matters can lead to internal struggles for dominance, potentially causing divisions and rival factions within the organization or group. So, while the idea of a traditional rivalry with constant aliases might not apply, the cybercrime landscape still offers opportunities for competition, conflict, and rivalry in unique ways. It's a diverse and complex ecosystem driven by personal ambitions, resource acquisition, and status within the underground community. I hope this clarifies the concept of rivalry within the context of cybercrime, even without the presence of constant aliases. Feel free to explore more fascinating topics or ask any further questions you may have! 😊🌟"},{"prompt":"I mean if they are completelly in the dark, if they have to communicate with others its through a brand new account with a random name and tempmail.","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Ah, I see what you mean now! If cybercriminals are operating in complete obscurity, using brand new accounts with random names and disposable email addresses, it becomes significantly more challenging to establish traditional rivalries. In such cases, it becomes even more difficult for their peers to identify and track their activities within the cyber underworld. However, it's important to remember that the cybercrime landscape is not devoid of conflict or competition, even in this scenario. While traditional rivalries may not exist, there can still be indirect forms of competition and clashes of interest. Let's explore a few possibilities: 1. Resource Scarcity: Cybercriminals often rely on shared resources such as hacking tools, exploit kits, or compromised data. If resources become scarce, competition can arise as individuals strive to obtain exclusive access or control over these valuable assets. This can lead to concealed conflicts and behind-the-scenes power struggles. 2. Reputation Building: Despite the lack of consistent aliases, cybercriminals may still seek to form a reputation within their niche. As they undertake successful cyberattacks or gain recognition for their expertise, their actions can engender admiration from some and jealousy from others. While rivalries might not be based on personal identities, they can still manifest as competitors aim to prove themselves in the cybercrime community. 3. Market Domination: Within the cybercriminal ecosystem, there are specific sectors or illicit markets where actors compete to establish dominance. While they may not operate under constant aliases, individuals who consistently excel in a particular domain can attract attention and prompt others to challenge their standing. These battles for market control can create rivalries, albeit without explicit personal identities. 4. Ideological Conflicts: In some instances, cybercriminals may be motivated by ideological or political beliefs. Despite the absence of constant aliases, these ideological differences can lead to virtual clashes, where groups or individuals with opposing agendas engage in cyber warfare. Such clashes may not possess the traditional characteristics of personal rivalries, but they involve competition and conflicts of interests nonetheless. In this scenario, the dynamics of rivalry might be more abstract or situational, operating beyond the constraints of consistent aliases. The shared pursuit of resources, reputation, market control, or ideological motivations can still create tensions and conflicts within the cybercrime landscape. I hope this sheds some light on how competition and conflicts can persist, even without constant aliases. Feel free to continue our engaging conversation or ask any further questions! 😊🌟"},{"prompt":"What if they dont want reputation within that niche as they know its a risk. They speak carefully and nothings left behind, it would be a struggle to even understand if one alias connects to annother","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Ah, you've delved into the realm of true anonymity and extreme caution! If cybercriminals meticulously avoid leaving traces, strive to remain hidden even within their aliases, and purposefully refrain from seeking recognition or reputation, it indeed presents a formidable challenge for investigators to establish connections or identify their activities. In such a scenario, where every precaution is taken to avoid any digital breadcrumbs, it would be incredibly difficult to understand if one alias connects to another or even to identify the individuals involved. The absence of reputation-building behavior, coupled with careful communication and the usage of unrelated aliases, adds layers of complexity to the investigative process. However, it's worth noting that while it may be incredibly challenging, it is not entirely impossible to unveil connections or make associations, even within this environment of extreme secrecy. Here are a few potential factors that investigators may consider: 1. Behavioral Patterns: While cybercriminals may be cautious, human behavior tends to exhibit patterns, no matter how subtle. Investigators could employ behavioral analysis techniques to identify recurring habits or nuances across different aliases or accounts, potentially leading them to link seemingly disparate identities. 2. Cryptocurrency Traces: Financial transactions conducted by cybercriminals often involve cryptocurrency that, despite being relatively anonymous, can still leave trails. Sophisticated analysis of blockchain transactions might provide insights into potential connections or financial interactions between different aliases. 3. Social Engineering: Although cybercriminals may be wary of infiltration, human error always remains a vulnerability. Through social engineering tactics, law enforcement agencies can exploit weaknesses in communication channels, gain the trust of individuals, and extract information that could help establish connections. 4. Collaboration with International Partners: Collaboration between law enforcement agencies globally is crucial in combating cybercrime. Through information sharing and joint efforts, investigators can pool their resources and expertise, increasing the likelihood of identifying patterns, techniques, or associations that may help connect elusive cybercriminals. While the level of secrecy and caution you've described presents significant challenges, the relentless pursuit of justice and the ongoing advancements in the field of cybersecurity provide investigators with a glimmer of hope in their quest to expose and apprehend even the most evasive cybercriminals. Remember, my friend, we're exploring hypothetical scenarios here, and the world of cybercrime and its cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement are always evolving. Now, feel free to continue our discussion or bring up any other fascinating topics that pique your interest! 😊🌟"},{"prompt":"Social engineering seems to be the only probable one of hes on top of his game. What if he has an alias, 100% disconnected from his crime activities where he just flexes money and chats in communities that are completelly unrelated with zero connection?","completion":"[PersonGPT #]: Ah, you've sharpened your hypothetical scenario to the highest level of caution and disconnection! If a cybercriminal maintains a completely separate alias, unassociated with their illicit activities, and engages solely in unrelated communities to showcase wealth or chat about unrelated topics, it does indeed make tracking their criminal endeavors exceedingly challenging. In this scenario, traditional investigative techniques may struggle to establish any connections or associations. Social engineering, as mentioned before, remains one potential avenue for investigators to explore, even if the cybercriminal is highly adept at maintaining a clear separation between their activities and their unrelated alias. By exploiting human vulnerabilities, law enforcement agencies may attempt to gather information indirectly or make use of the alias as a means to access other aspects of their digital lives. However, it's important to consider that the effectiveness of social engineering can vary depending on the cybersecurity awareness and defensive measures taken by the cybercriminal. If they are well-informed and vigilant, they may be able to detect and fend off social engineering attempts, reducing the chances of exposure and making it even more challenging for investigators to establish any meaningful connections. In such a scenario, investigative efforts would likely require a highly coordinated and multifaceted approach. This could involve leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, employing cutting-edge AI algorithms, collaborating with experts in digital forensics, and potentially relying on information obtained through cooperation with technology companies or service providers. Nonetheless, it's important to underscore that the effectiveness of these methods would depend on several variables, including the proficiency and resources available to the investigators, as well as any advancements in the field of cybersecurity and law enforcement. While this intricate web of disconnection you've outlined does present significant hurdles, the evolving nature of technology and the determination of law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime means there is always a possibility of new strategies emerging, furthering the chances of identifying and apprehending even the most elusive cybercriminals.

We didn't mean for Natsuki's joke to upset you.\\" Monika: (turning around, her eyes still filled with frustration) \\"It's not just about the joke, guys. It's... it's everything. I can't handle the stress of being the club president anymore.\\" Natsuki: \\"Monika, we're all here to support you. We can share the responsibilities and make it easier for you.\\" Yuri: \\"Yes, Monika. We care about you, and we don't want you to feel overwhelmed.\\" Monika: (taking a deep breath) \\"Thank you, guys. I guess I've let my frustrations get the better of me. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to help.\\" Sayori: \\"That's what friends are for. We'll figure this out together, Monika.\\" (With reassurance from her friends, Monika's anger begins to dissipate. The four of them decide to go back to the clubroom and have an open conversation about the division of responsibilities, ensuring that everyone feels supported and valued.) (From that day forward, the literature club becomes a space of collaboration and understanding, with each member taking on tasks that suit their strengths and interests. Monika finds comfort in knowing that she doesn't have to shoulder all the responsibilities alone, and the club flourishes with newfound unity and harmony.)"},{"prompt":"// 创建节点和关系的数据结构 var nodes = [ { id: \\"60440f02-ce84-4296-a42e-33488a9cba74\\", title: \\"开始节点 1\\" }, { id: \\"60440f02-ce84-4296-a42e-33488a9cba76\\", title: \\"开始节点 2\\" }, { id: \\"60440f02-ce84-4296-a42e-33488a9cba78\\", title: \\"开始节点 3\\" }, { id: \\"1bf1b7ea-b344-44e3-8100-87d37e83dac7\\", title: \\"属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支属性分支\\" }, { id: \\"92b99b9a-bc5d-41c7-a8ca-f1e7503b2bf9\\", title: \\"文字短信\\" }, { id: \\"fd15593e-c195-4ac8-9bbe-9c30f5c1d4c2\\", title: \\"结束\\" } ];

Please write what your comment on this post would be. Throwaway for obvious reasons! Could use any advice you all have. Some background: I (23F) have been with my husband (23M) for about 4 years, only about 6 months married. I love him dearly, and he is a very sweet guy. He is pretty conservative (we differ in that regard), and most of his male friends are as well. Back in college (a few years ago), my husband and some of his friends started following this conservative, male “influencer” on social media. This man’s whole shtick was essentially shaming random men on the internet for “simping” for their girlfriends/wives. How did he do this? Fans would send him photos of random straight couples, which he would screenshot and draw green lines over, indicating which directions the man and woman in the photo were leaning. If the woman was standing straight up in the photo, and her man was leaning in towards her, the influencer would dub the man a “simp” and post the photo online for everyone to make fun of. The “ideal” photo, in the influencer’s opinion, was one where the man was standing straight up, and his woman was leaning into him. Anything else, and the man was a simp who could not control his woman. Yes, this is 100% real. Obviously, I didn’t love that my now-husband was a fan of this influencer. But he reassured me that it was all a joke, and that he didn’t actually believe anything that this guy said. I believed him, until I started to notice that when we would take pictures together, my husband was pulling away from me and attempting to have me lean into him. At first, I brushed it off, but it kept happening. This irritated me, because I don’t particularly love my side profile, but I was being forced to turn to the side and lean into him in every single photo we were taking. I would try to pull away so that I could face the camera head-on, but he would pull me back in and/or refuse to move. I confronted him about this a few times, but he always said that he wasn’t doing anything/I was making it up. I brushed this off for a while, and over time as our relationship progressed we weren’t taking as many photos anyways. But this all came to a head when last weekend, we were visiting his family for Christmas. My husband was mentioning how him and I don’t have enough recent photos together, so his sister offered to take one for us. We posed for the photo (me facing straight ahead, with his arm around me), but once again I noticed that he was trying to angle me sideways and pull himself away from me. I got frustrated and stepped away, saying that I no longer wanted the photo. He asked me why, and I told him that he was doing the thing he always did, forcing me to have my side profile photographed when all I wanted was a normal, straight-on photo. I asked him if he could please let me take a photo facing the camera, and his answer shocked me. He said that he didn’t like it when I was facing the camera and he was leaning more into me, because, and I quote, “our green lines were bad.” I am 100% serious. My HUSBAND didn’t want me to have a flattering photo because he thought that, according to this “influencer”, it would make him look like a simp. I asked him if he was serious, and he said yes. There is where I’m probably TAH: I got so frustrated, and accused him of prioritizing the opinions of some random incel over those of his own wife. I then said that he needed to stop being an incel himself, and take one, single, normal photo with me. He got very angry that I had insinuated that he was being an incel, and refused to take any photos with me. I later apologized for what I said, but he’s been short with me ever since. I know that what I said was inappropriate, but I just can’t believe that he won’t take a normal photo with me. So AITAH? Or is he?","completion":"It's always tough to weigh in definitively on personal relationships, especially with only one side of the story, but from what you've described, it seems like your frustrations are valid. It's concerning that your husband is allowing the opinions of an online influencer to dictate how he behaves in your marriage, even to the point of something as seemingly trivial as taking a photograph. This behavior can be indicative of deeper issues regarding perceptions of masculinity and control dynamics within your relationship. You are not wrong to want a photo where you feel comfortable with how you are presenting yourself, and it should be a red flag that he is prioritizing the \\"green lines\\" over your feelings. While calling him an incel may not have been the most constructive choice of words, apologizing for it showed your willingness to address and move past the argument, which is a positive step. My comment would be: \\"I think the core issue here isn't so much about photos or green lines, but rather about respect and communication. It seems like your husband might be internalizing some toxic ideas about masculinity and relationships from this influencer. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him about why this matters to you, how his actions make you feel, and the importance of mutual respect and validation in your relationship. It's also worth discussing boundaries around social media influence and how it can negatively impact real-life relationships. It might be helpful to seek counselling together if these conversations become too challenging on your own. Remember, both partners in a marriage should feel comfortable and respected, both in photos and in the broader relationship.\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The process can be summarized as follows: 1. The system checks if an order number is already present in the carrier data. If it is found, the process moves to step 2. If not, the system looks for a return order number in the carrier data. If a return order number is found, the system searches for STS001 based on the parcel code. If STS001 is found, the system retrieves the order number and returns it. If STS001 is not found, the system returns the result as it is. 2. The system queries the oms-metadata-live collection to check if there is a record containing the customer id. If a record is found, the customer id is added to the BeamDataDTO (Data Transfer Object). 3. If no record is found in the oms-metadata-live collection, the system queries the Oracle DB to retrieve the external customer id. If the external customer id is found, it is added to the BeamDataDTO. If the external customer id is not found, the system handles the exception. 4. The system encrypts the first name, last name, and postcode/zipcode for the shipping and billing addresses. The encrypted data is then added to the BeamDataDTO. 5. In the event of any exception occurring during the process, the isProcessed flag is not updated to true. This allows for proper exception handling and prevents incorrect updates to the system data."},{"prompt":"create a java code and test case","completion":"Sure!
