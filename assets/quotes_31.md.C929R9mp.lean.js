We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the “short disruption” bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there’s no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline “Tangible Value” factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper’s lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It 🙈 Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a “GAAP Intangible Value” factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an “Intangible Value” factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let’s put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value’s long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the “value factor,” which is a long-short strategy. We’ll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value “portfolio” (opposed to “factor”). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn’t look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens 🔍 . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional “style factors” and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn’t come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we’ll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box 📦 Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the “factorization” of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called “style boxes.” Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can’t be both small and large, it can’t be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for “style drift!” ☠️ Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: “... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. … anybody that tells you, ‘You ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,’ really does not understand investing. … And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‘Now it’s time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,’ or something like that, because it just doesn’t make any sense.” Instead, he advocated: “Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‘value’ and ‘growth.’ Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.” Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn’t mean he has to restrict himself to buying only 💩 -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of “Grahamian” value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled “value.” If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered “growth.” Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts’ consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio’s style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly “pro-value” and “anti-growth,” betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional “style box value” managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of “thinking outside the style box.” Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it’s 2021, and there’s nothing wrong with a little “intellectual cross-dressing!” 👘 Uniting the Tribes ⚔️ For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value’s recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek “growth at a reasonable price” but simply “growth at any price.” This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between “growth” and “value”. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let’s get value investing back on track!

Here is a structured approach to identifying and organizing potential datasets: # 1. **Financial Statements and Market Data** - **Objective**: Capture tangible assets and historical financial performance. - **Datasets Needed**: - Publicly available financial statements (10-K, 10-Q reports) for balance sheet data, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, and other relevant indicators. - Market data including stock prices, market capitalization, dividend yields, and historical performance. # 2. **Intangible Assets Specific Data** - **Objective**: Quantify the four pillars of intangible value identified (intellectual property, human capital, brand equity, and network effects). - **Datasets Needed**: - **Intellectual Property (Patents)**: USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) database for patent filings and grants, considering citation analysis to determine patent value and technological relevance. - **Human Capital**: LinkedIn or similar professional networks for data on employee skills, company reviews on Glassdoor for employee satisfaction and corporate culture insights, and academic publications or patents to gauge R&D team strength. - **Brand Equity**: Social media analytics for brand mentions and sentiment analysis, consumer review sites, and brand valuation reports. - **Network Effects**: User base size from annual reports or industry analyses, data on user engagement from companies or third-party analytics services, and measurements of platform stickiness or churn rates if available. # 3. **Alternative Data for Innovation and Market Dynamics** - **Objective**: Leverage unconventional data sources to assess the innovation level and broader market position/competition of companies. - **Datasets Needed**: - Web scraped data from company and industry-specific news sites, press releases for new product launches or technology advancements. - Social media sentiment analysis to gauge public perception and anticipation of products/services and innovation. - Data from Kaggle, GitHub, or other platforms for public machine learning and software development projects indicating technological advancement and focus areas of companies. # 4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) Prepared Datasets** - **Objective**: Utilize datasets structured for direct application in NLP and ML models to extract insights from unstructured data. - **Datasets Needed**: - Pre-processed and annotated text datasets from financial news articles, earnings call transcripts, and industry reports for sentiment analysis and topic modeling. - Image datasets for logo recognition (related to brand equity) or product identification in social media posts. # 5. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Data** - **Objective**: Integrate ESG factors as part of intangible value assessment, given increasing investor focus on sustainability and corporate governance. - **Datasets Needed**: - Scores and reports from ESG rating agencies. - Data on corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and outcomes from company reports. # Data Collection and Processing Considerations: - Ensure legality and compliance with data collection methods, especially when dealing with personal data (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). - Consider the need for data cleaning and preprocessing to structure unstructured data effectively for analysis. - Develop or utilize existing NLP models trained on financial and industry-specific corpora for better context understanding in analysis. - Regularly update datasets to capture the most current market and company performance data for real-time or near-real-time analysis. Acquiring and effectively processing these datasets requires substantial computational resources, skilled data scientists, and potentially costly data acquisition methods (purchasing data from providers, investing in web scraping infrastructure, etc.). However, the insights gained can significantly enhance the valuation models and investment strategies focusing on intangible asset valuation."},{"prompt":"with django we have two tables : steps containing : \\"id\\",\\"step_name\\" and substeps containing \\"id\\",\\"substep_name\\",\\"step\\" .. we want to create models in a way where \\"step\\" in substeps table is the \\"step_name\\" from steps table , in a way the code raises an error if the name isn't in the table steps","completion":"To implement this in Django while ensuring data integrity and the constraint you've mentioned – that the \`step\` in \`Substep\` model should exist as a \`step_name\` in \`Step\` model, and an error should be raised if this is not the case – you need to use Django's ForeignKey relationships wisely and customize the saving behavior of your models. Here's a simple way to achieve this: Firstly, define your models. Typically, you would directly relate \`Substep\` to \`Step\` using a ForeignKey. However, because you want the \`step\` in \`Substep\` to refer to the \`step_name\` of \`Step\` and not just any name, you need to ensure that \`step_name\` in \`Step\` is unique. Then, in \`Substep\`, \`step\` will be a ForeignKey pointing to \`Step.step_name\` instead of \`Step\`'s ID. However, Django ORM doesn't support ForeignKey relationships to non-primary key fields by default without a bit of tweaking. Given the direct reference requirement and Django's limitations, here are the models tailored to your needs with a workaround: \`\`\`python from django.db import models from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError class Step(models.Model): step_name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True) def __str__(self): return self.step_name class Substep(models.Model): substep_name = models.CharField(max_length=255) # Here step_name is just a name holder step_name = models.CharField(max_length=255) # Actual foreign key relationship to ensure integrity step = models.ForeignKey(Step, on_delete=models.CASCADE, to_field='step_name', related_name='substeps') def __str__(self): return self.substep_name def clean(self): super().clean() # Check if the step_name in Step exists if not Step.objects.filter(step_name=self.step_name).exists(): raise ValidationError({'step_name': \\"Step name doesn't exist in Step table.\\"}) def save(self, *args, **kwargs): # Assign step based on step_name before saving if self.step_name: self.step = Step.objects.get(step_name=self.step_name) super().save(*args, **kwargs) \`\`\` Explanation: - In \`Step\`, \`step_name\` is marked as \`unique\` to ensure no duplicate step names. - In \`Substep\`, we maintain a ForeignKey \`step\` pointing to \`Step\` based on \`step_name\`, enforced by \`to_field='step_name'\`. This ensures data integrity at the database level. - We override the \`clean\` method in \`Substep\` to include a custom validation check ensuring the provided \`step_name\` exists in \`Step\` table before saving a \`Substep\` instance. This mechanism raises a \`ValidationError\` if the \`step_name\` does not exist, preventing the instance from being saved. - In the overridden \`save\` method, the corresponding \`Step\` instance is assigned to \`step\` based on \`step_name\` before calling the parent class's \`save\` method. Please note, while the model does what is asked, it does have a redundancy by having both a direct ForeignKey and a duplicate field holding the \`step_name\`. In practice, you would usually only need the ForeignKey, and you could access the name via \`step.step_name\`. The additional \`step_name\` field and related logic are there to strictly adhere to the constraints and behavior specified in your question."},{"prompt":"write a generic django adrf crud class that contains all the necessary crud for any models in a way that when in views i can just calls model_name_view(class) it will auto get all the nessceary crud ( including setting paginations , filters ,sorting , choosing search params etc... )","completion":"Creating a highly generic CRUD class using Django Rest Framework (DRF) requires leveraging DRF's powerful features such as \`viewsets\`, \`serializers\`, and \`filters\`. This approach will allow you to encapsulate all CRUD operations inside a single class, enabling easy reuse for any model by merely specifying the model, serializer, and filters. Below is an example of how to create such a generic CRUD class using DRF. This solution involves: 1. Creating a generic viewset class that you can then extend for specific models. 2. Utilizing DRF's mixins or the \`ModelViewSet\` for full CRUD capabilities. 3. Leveraging \`django_filters\` and DRF's built-in filtering, searching, and ordering to cater to specific requirements. # Step 1: Install Django Rest Framework and Django Filters If you haven’t already, you need to install Django Rest Framework and \`django-filter\`: \`\`\`bash pip install djangorestframework django-filter \`\`\` Add them to your \`INSTALLED_APPS\` in \`settings.py\`: \`\`\`python INSTALLED_APPS = [ ...

As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, Django Rest Framework does not natively support asynchronous views or serializers in a comprehensive manner. Django itself has been supporting asynchronous views since version 3.1, but integrating these with Django Rest Framework for fully asynchronous CRUD operations requires careful consideration and, in some cases, custom solutions. However, you can still work around this by using Django's asynchronous capabilities alongside Django Rest Framework for read operations quite straightforwardly. For full CRUD operations, the community has taken various approaches to bridge this gap, like utilizing asynchronous Django models or custom async wrappers. Given this context, here's how you could approach creating a generic asynchronous CRUD class that leverages Django's async capabilities for handling database operations, with a reminder that certain operations, especially those involving DRF serializers and saving operations, should be carefully managed: # Step 1: Enable Asynchronous Database Configurations Ensure your database backend supports asynchronous operations. As of Django 3.1 and onwards, the default Django ORM can run in async mode for querying the database. However, writing operations are notably tricky due to transaction management. # Step 2: Creating an Asynchronous Generic CRUD ViewSet This example demonstrates how to perform read operations asynchronously. Note that when dealing with write operations (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), extra caution is required due to Django Rest Framework's serializer.save() not being asynchronous. \`\`\`python from rest_framework.viewsets import GenericViewSet from rest_framework.mixins import ListModelMixin, RetrieveModelMixin from django.db.models import QuerySet class AsyncGenericCRUDViewSet(ListModelMixin, RetrieveModelMixin, GenericViewSet): \\"\\"\\" Demonstrates a read-only ViewSet with async support for list and retrieve. For full CRUD, you'd have to carefully handle POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. \\"\\"\\" queryset = None serializer_class = None async def get_queryset(self) -> QuerySet: \\"\\"\\" Override this method to asynchronously customize querysets. \\"\\"\\" assert self.queryset is not None, ( \\"'%s' should either include a \`queryset\` attribute, \\" \\"or override the \`get_queryset()\` method.\\" % self.__class__.__name__ ) return self.queryset async def list(self, request, *args, **kwargs): \\"\\"\\" Asynchronously list resources.

Adapted from RetrieveModelMixin to async. \\"\\"\\" instance = await self.get_object() # Note: Make get_object async-compatible serializer = self.get_serializer(instance) return Response(serializer.data) \`\`\` # Key Aspects and Limitations 1. **Transaction Management for Write Operations:** Carefully manage transactions in async context. Django's \`@transaction.atomic\` is not designed to work seamlessly in asynchronous views as of my last update. Look into Django's async transaction management utilities. 2. **Serializer and Save Operations:** DRF serializers and their \`.save()\` method are synchronous and should be called from synchronous contexts. Until DRF has native async support, one workaround is calling these synchronously within threads, for example, using Django's \`sync_to_async\` utility, but this approach needs cautious handling. 3. **Filtering and Pagination:** The \`filter_queryset\` and other queryset-modifying methods used above would need to be adapted for asynchronous operations or used cautiously to ensure they don't introduce bottlenecks or conflict with async patterns. 4. **Custom and Third-party Solutions:** As communities around Django and DRF evolve, keep an eye out for third-party libraries or updates offering more seamless async CRUD handling with DRF. Please be aware that integrating Django Rest Framework for fully asynchronous operations remains a complex and evolving topic, requiring custom solutions and careful consideration of the caveats mentioned above.

Эта распределенная система ответственности позволяет оптимизировать процесс подготовки и съёмок, обеспечивая, чтобы каждый аспект проекта был должным образом обработан профессионалами в своей области. Такая структура способствует эффективной и скоординированной работе всей команды."},{"prompt":"Режиссер не может сам один по своему виденью сказать правильно это или нет, поэтому съемочная группа дает советы режиссеру чтобы он смог решить. Я не прав?","completion":"Вы абсолютно правы в том, что процесс создания фильма является коллективным усилием, и особенно важна роль обратной связи и советов от съёмочной группы для режиссёра. Режиссёр, несмотря на то что является ключевой фигурой, определяющей художественное и креативное направление проекта, в значительной мере полагается на экспертизу, знания и творческие идеи всей своей команды. Каждый профессионал на площадке – от оператора до звукорежиссёра, от сценариста до художника по костюмам – вносит свой уникальный вклад в создание фильма. Эти специалисты обладают глубокими знаниями в своей области и могут предложить новые идеи, пути решения конкретных задач или продуманные альтернативы, на которые режиссёр может и не обратить внимание. Взаимодействие и диалог между режиссёром и командой крайне важны для успешной реализации кинопроекта. Обратная связь от команды помогает режиссёру: - Увидеть сцены под разными углами и определить наиболее эффективный подход к съёмке; - Расширить своё творческое видение за счёт интеграции идей и предложений от других членов команды; - Принимать обдуманные решения, учитывая технические и производственные аспекты проекта; - Успешно преодолевать возникающие трудности и проблемы в процессе съёмок. Таким образом, хотя режиссёр и является руководителем проекта, его решения часто формируются на основе совместной работы, обмена мнениями и предложений всей съёмочной группы. Это сотрудничество способствует созданию осмысленного, насыщенного и качественного кинопродукта."},{"prompt":"Если режиссер составил сценарий, то мне кажется он уже дал свое виденье. Ему только осталось руководить и принять решения, если он не может принять решения, то он советуется со съемочной группой","completion":"Да, ваше понимание процесса верно. Когда режиссёр является автором сценария, он вкладывает в него своё представление и видение фильма, задавая тем самым основные темы, сюжетные линии, персонажей и диалоги. Это даёт режиссёру уникальную возможность глубже погрузиться в творческий процесс и более тесно контролировать выполнение своего видения на всех этапах производства фильма. Однако, даже если режиссёр является автором сценария, в процессе превращения текста в кинематографическое произведение могут возникать моменты, требующие дополнительных решений или адаптаций. Эти моменты могут касаться кастинга, локаций, визуального стиля, специальных эффектов, музыки и многочисленных других компонентов, которые в совокупности создают готовый фильм. В таких случаях общение и сотрудничество с профессионалами своей команды — оператором, художником-постановщиком, композитором, руководителем кастинга и другими — помогают режиссёру принимать обдуманные, информированные решения. Члены съёмочной группы, обладающие опытом и специализированными знаниями в своих областях, могут предложить ценные идеи и решения, которые обогатят проект и помогут реализовать первоначальное видение режиссёра в полной мере. Также важно отметить, что режиссёру важно уметь слушать свою команду и быть открытым к диалогу, так как это один из ключевых аспектов успешной режиссуры. Выбор моментов, в которых стоит идти на компромисс, и тех, в которых необходимо оставаться непреклонным в своем видении, определяет режиссёра как сильного лидера проекта."},{"prompt":"Студия могут не сделать меня режиссером в сша у которого нет опыта, не ходил в школу, и имеет возраст 23 года, хотя этот человек составил полностью сценарий и составил даже памятку хоть и не профессиональную","completion":"В киноиндустрии США, как и во многих других странах, путь к роли режиссёра может быть разным, и нет единственного \\"правильного\\" пути к успеху. Фактически, истории успеха в этой сфере часто уникальны и разнообразны. Однако есть несколько важных моментов, которые стоит учитывать. # Влияние образования и возраста Наличие или отсутствие формального образования в области кинематографии само по себе не является решающим фактором для успеха в киноиндустрии. Многие известные режиссёры начинали без специализированного образования или сменили карьеру после занятий в совершенно несвязанных с кино сферах. Возвраст тоже не является преградой. В 23 года многие только начинают свой карьерный путь, и есть много примеров режиссёров, которые достигли значительных успехов в относительно молодом возрасте. # Важность сценария и подготовки Качественный сценарий — это значительный актив, и если вы смогли создать захватывающий и уникальный сценарий, это уже большое достижение. Составление памятки и демонстрация того, что вы тщательно продумали все этапы производства, также может восприниматься как показатель вашей серьёзности и готовности к работе над проектом. # Реалии индустрии Однако киноиндустрия чрезвычайно конкурентоспособная, и студии обычно рискуют большими суммами денег при производстве фильмов. Из-за этого они могут быть склонны отдавать предпочтение режиссёрам с доказанным опытом работы и успехом на рынке. Для новичков в этой сфере это может означать, что им может быть сложнее получить возможность работать над крупными проектами без предварительного опыта, портфолио и проверенной репутации. # Пути к цели Тем не менее, существуют альтернативные пути и стратегии для начинающих режиссёров: - **Короткометражные фильмы**: Создание и продвижение короткометражных фильмов может стать отличным способом демонстрации вашего таланта и вида на режиссуру. - **Фестивали**: Участие и возможно победы в кинофестивалях могут привлечь внимание к вашему творчеству. - **Независимое производство**: Работа над независимыми проектами и поиск инвестиций за пределами традиционных студийных путей может открыть двери к более крупным возможностям. - **Сетевое взаимодействие**: Построение профессиональных связей и сетевое взаимодействие с другими специалистами в индустрии могут помочь в продвижении вашей карьеры. В конечном итоге, независимо от вашего образования, возраста или прошлого опыта, ключевыми факторами успеха в кино являются талант, настойчивость и способность использовать доступные вам ресурсы для реализации своего творческого потенциала."},{"prompt":"Нет ну практически все режиссеры не имеют опыта, но студия которая дает шанс обучаться, это уже опыт, если бояться рисковать то они присоединяют еще одного дополнительного режиссера","completion":"Вы поднимаете важный момент о том, как киноиндустрия может поддерживать новых талантов. Действительно, многие начинающие режиссёры могут не иметь значительного опыта в крупномасштабных проектах, но студии иногда предоставляют шансы талантливым новичкам, видя в их творчестве потенциал. Студии могут предпринимать различные меры для снижения рисков, связанных с назначением на режиссёру нового проекта человека с ограниченным опытом: 1. **Менторство и совместная работа**: После того как новичку дается возможность режиссировать, студии могут также предоставить ментора или более опытного режиссёра для совместной работы. Это не только уменьшает риски для студии, но и предоставляет ценный обучающий опыт для новичка. 2. **Помощь заместителя режиссёра (associate director)**: В некоторых случаях рядом с начинающим режиссёром может быть назначен заместитель, который обладает опытом управления большими проектами и командами, что помогает обеспечить бесперебойное ведение производственного процесса. 3. **Ограниченная роль или проекты поменьше**: Иногда студии могут предложить новым режиссёрам начать с более мелких проектов, таких как короткометражные фильмы, эпизоды телевизионных сериалов или музыкальные клипы. Это позволяет новичкам набираться опыта, не подвергая основной бюджет или главный проект большому риску. 4. **Рабочие группы и семинары**: Некоторые студии и образовательные учреждения предлагают рабочие группы, мастер-классы и семинары для молодых режиссёров, где они могут научиться от профессионалов индустрии и развить свои навыки. Важно понимать, что карьерный путь в индустрии может сильно различаться и зависит от множества факторов, включая индивидуальный талант, настойчивость, умение налаживать контакты и немалую долю удачи. Тем не менее, страсть к кинематографу и готовность учиться на своём пути могут в итоге привести к успешной карьере в кино."},{"prompt":"Подготовка к сьемке по последовательности сделана?: 1.

단순한 일직선 상의 과정이 아니라, 다양한 종들이 나타났다 사라진 복잡한 나무와 같습니다. 최초의 유사인류로 간주되는 종은 대체로 약 600만 ~ 700만 년 전 아프리카에서 처음 나타난 것으로 추정됩니다. 이 시기에 해당하는 유사인류는 ‘사할란트로푸스 차데네시스(Sahelanthropus tchadensis)’와 같은 초기 형태의 종들이 포함됩니다. 호모 사피엔스, 즉 현대 인류는 약 30만년 전 아프리카에서 등장했다고 알려져 있습니다. 이는 지금으로부터 대략 30만년 전으로, 현대 인류는 다른 유사인류 종들과 차별화되어 일련의 독특한 특징들을 갖게 되었습니다. 예를 들어, 복잡한 언어 사용, 추상적 사고, 예술과 종교에 대한 이해 등이 현대 인류만의 특성으로 간주됩니다. 다만, 인류의 진화에 대한 연구는 계속해서 진행되고 있으며, 새로운 발견으로 인해 호모 사피엔스의 기원과 관련된 연대는 약간의 조정이 있을 수 있습니다. 따라서 현재까지의 연구와 발견에 따른 상대적으로 널리 받아들여지는 견해는 호모 사피엔스가 약 30만년 전에 처음 등장했다는 것입니다."},{"prompt":"파이토케미컬이 든 음식을 최대한 다양하게

남은 식품을 말합니다. 이러한 식품들은 주로 빠른 에너지원을 제공하지만, 과다 섭취 시 체중 증가, 혈당 조절 문제, 만성 질환의 위험 증가 등의 문제를 일으킬 수 있습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 다양한 요리 및 식단에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 정제 녹말을 포함한 식품 목록은 다음과 같습니다: 1. **흰빵:** 통곡물이 아닌 정제된 밀가루를 주원료로 사용합니다. 2. **흰쌀 및 흰쌀밥:** 완전히 도정하여 겨와 싹이 제거된 쌀. 3. **파스타(정제된):** 정제 밀가루로 만든 스파게티, 마카로니 등. 4. **스낵:** 대부분의 가공 스낵(감자칩, 크래커 등)은 정제된 탄수화물을 주원료로 함유. 5. **설탕이 첨가된 시리얼:** 많은 조식용 시리얼이 정제 곡물로 만들어지고, 설탕이나 기타 감미료가 추가됩니다. 6. **소다 및 달콤한 음료:** 액상 형태의 정제 탄수화물을 대표하는 설탕 첨가 음료. 7. **과자 및 쿠키:** 대부분의 가공된 디저트와 과자들은 정제된 밀가루와 설탕을 주성분으로 합니다. 8. **인스턴트 라면:** 정제된 밀가루로 만들어진 면과 간편하게 조리할 수 있도록 첨가물이 포함된 조미료가 특징입니다. 9. **피자 도우(가공된):** 통곡물이 아닌 정제된 밀가루로 만든 피자 도우. 10. **파이 크러스트 및 베이킹 믹스:** 베이킹에 사용되는 많은 가공 혼합재료가 정제된 밀가루를 기반으로 합니다. 이 식품들은 일상 다이어트의 일부로 쉽게 통합될 수 있지만, 건강한 식단을 위해서는 정제 녹말을 포함한 식품보다는 통곡물, 신선한 과일과 채소, 단백질이 풍부한 식품들을 더 많이 포함시키는 것이 좋습니다. 정제된 탄수화물의 과다 섭취는 영양 불균형을 초래할 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"정제 탄수화물과 정제 녹말은 동치입니까?","completion":"정제 탄수화물과 정제 녹말은 엄밀히 말해서 동일한 것은 아니지만, 일반적인 식단과 건강에 관한 맥락에서는 서로 밀접하게 관련된 개념입니다. 둘 다 가공을 통해 영양소가 대부분 제거된 형태를 말하며, 주로 빠른 에너지를 제공하지만 장기적으로는 건강에 부정적 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. **정제 탄수화물**은 섬유질, 비타민, 미네랄 등이 대부분 제거된 탄수화물을 말합니다. 이는 주로 설탕, 정제된 밀가루 등을 포함하며, 이러한 정제 과정을 거치면서 '빈 칼로리' 식품이 되어 영양가가 현저히 떨어지게 됩니다. **정제 녹말**은 곡물, 감자 등에서 녹말을 추출하고 정제하는 과정을 거쳐 얻어진 순수한 녹말을 의미합니다. 이 과정에서도 원재료의 섬유질과 영양소 대부분이 제거되며, 주로 산업적인 식품 가공에 사용됩니다. 따라서, 정제 탄수화물은 설탕과 정제된 곡물(밀가루 등)을 포함하는 넓은 범주에 해당하며, 정제 녹말은 이 중에서도 녹말을 정제하여 얻은 특정 제품을 뜻합니다. 두 용어 모두

AMPK는 세포 내 ATP(에너지) 수준이 저하될 때 활성화되는 효소로, 에너지 생산을 촉진하고 에너지 소비를 억제함으로써 세포의 에너지 균형을 유지합니다. 이 과정에서 AMPK는 자가포식을 활성화하여 세포 내 부산물 및 손상된 구성 요소를 제거하고, 에너지를 회복하도록 돕습니다. 따라서 AMPK는 에너지 부족 상태에서 세포의 생존과 기능 유지에 중요한 역할을 합니다. 그러나 모든 자가포식 과정이 AMPK에 의해서만 활성화되는 것은 아닙니다. 자가포식은 매우 복잡하며, 다양한 신호 경로와 분자들이 관련되어 있습니다. 예를 들어, mTOR(mammalian target of rapamycin)은 AMPK와 반대로 세포 성장과 단백질 합성을 촉진하며 에너지가 풍부할 때 자가포식을 억제합니다. 그러나, 영양소가 부족하거나 스트레스가 있을 때 mTOR 활동이 억제되어 자가포식이 활성화될 수 있습니다. 따라서, 자가포식은 AMPK를 포함한 다양한 분자와 경로에 의해 조절되는 복잡한 과정이며, 이를 통해 세포는 다양한 스트레스와 환경 변화에 대응할 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"1.커피의 폴리페놀 이름은 무엇입니까? 2. 세놀리틱 음식을 최대한 다양하게 언급해줘","completion":"# 1. 커피의 폴리페놀 이름 커피에 포함된 폴리페놀 중 일부는 다음과 같습니다: - **클로로겐산(Chlorogenic Acids, CGAs)**: 커피의 주요 폴리페놀로, 항산화, 항염, 혈당 조절 효과가 있습니다. - **카페익산(Caffeic Acid)**: 항산화 성분으로 염증을 줄이고 DNA 손상을 방지하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. - **페룰산(Ferulic Acid)**: 자외선에 대한 보호 효과와 항산화 효능이 있으며, 신경 보호 효과도 있습니다. - **퀸산(Quinic Acid)**: 클로로겐산의 대사 산물로, 커피의 쓴맛과 산미를 제공합니다. 이들 폴리페놀은 커피의 맛과 향뿐만 아니라, 건강에 이로운 다양한 효과를 제공합니다. # 2. 세놀리틱(Senolytic) 음식 세놀리틱 음식은 세포 내 노화된 세포(센센트 세포)를 선택적으로 제거하는 데 도움이 되는 식품을 말합니다. 이러한 음식들은 노화 방지와 건강 증진에 기여할 수 있습니다. 세놀리틱 효과를 갖는 일부 식품 및 성분은 다음과 같습니다: - **퀘르세틴(Quercetin)**: 사과, 양파, 카퍼스, 브로콜리 등에 들어있는 강력한 항산화제입니다. 센센트 세포의 제거를 돕습니다. - **피세틴(Fisetin)**: 딸기, 사과, 오이, 양파 등에 포함되어 있으며, 센센트 세포 제거와 관련된 연구에서 주목받고 있습니다. - **올레우로페인(Oleuropein)**: 올리브 오일, 특히 엑스트라 버진 올리브 오일에 풍부하며, 센센트 세포 제거에 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. - **커큐민(Curcumin)**: 강황의 주요 활성성분으로, 항염, 항산화 뿐만 아니라 세놀리틱 효과도 보입니다. 이외에도 폴리페놀이 풍부한 다양한 채소, 과일, 허브, 향신료를 포함한 식단은 세놀리틱 효과를 높이는데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 세놀리틱 효과에 대한 연구는 아직 초기 단계이며, 실제 음식이 인체 내에서 어떻게 작용하는지에 대한 보다 많은 연구가 필요합니다."},{"prompt":"퀘르세틴이 많은 음식은 어떤 게 있어?","completion":"퀘르세틴은 강력한 항산화 효과를 가진 폴리페놀의 한 종류로, 여러 식물성 식품에 자연적으로 존재합니다. 퀘르세틴이 풍부한 음식을 꾸준히 섭취하는 것은 염증 감소, 혈압 조절, 심혈관 질환 예방 등에 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 다음은 퀘르세틴이 풍부한 음식들입니다: 1. **양파:** 특히 붉은 양파가 퀘르세틴 함량이 높습니다. 2. **사과:** 껍질을 포함하여 먹을 경우 퀘르세틴 섭취량을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 3. **포도:** 빨간색과 보라색 포도 모두 퀘르세틴을 함유하고 있습니다. 4. **베리류:** 딸기, 블랙베리, 라즈베리와 같은 베리류도 좋은 퀘르세틴 원입니다. 5. **케일:** 케일과 같은 녹색 잎채소도 퀘르세틴이 풍부합니다. 6. **브로콜리:** 케일과 마찬가지로, 브로콜리에도 퀘르세틴이 들어 있습니다. 7. **녹차:** 녹차는 다양한 폴리페놀을 함유하고 있으며 퀘르세틴도 포함됩니다. 8. **토마토:** 생토마토와 토마토 제품 모두 퀘르세틴을 함유하고 있습니다. 9. **고추류:** 녹색과 빨간 고추에도 퀘르세틴이 있습니다. 10. **아스파라거스:** 피토케미컬이 풍부한 아스파라거스에도 퀘르세틴이 포함되어 있습니다. 위 목록에 있는 음식들을 식단에 포함시킴으로써, 다양한 건강 혜택을 누릴 수 있으며, 특히 퀘르세틴의 항산화 효과를 활용할 수 있습니다. 다만, 식품 섭취를 통한 퀘르세틴의 효과를 최적화하려면, 전반적으로 균형 잡힌 식단을 유지하는 것이 중요합니다."},{"prompt":"아스피린은 장내미생물에 해롭습니까?","completion":"아스피린이 장내 미생물에 미치는 영향은 연구에 따라 다양할 수 있으며, 이 주제에 대한 명확한 결론은 아직 연구 중입니다. 아스피린은 비스테로이드성 항염증제(NSAID)이며, 통증 완화, 염증 감소, 항응고 효과 등으로 널리 사용됩니다. 하지만 항염증제로서의 특성상, 장기간 사용 시 소화관의 점막을 손상시켜 위염이나 위궤양을 유발할 수도 있고, 이는 간접적으로 장내 미생물의 균형에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 몇몇 연구들은 아스피린이나 다른 비스테로이드성 항염증제가 장내 미생물 구성에 변화를 일으킬 수 있다고 보고합니다. 예를 들어, 일부 연구에서는 아스피린 사용이 특정 유익한 균주의 감소를 초래하거나 장내 염증을 유발하는 미생물의 증가와 관련이 있을 수 있다는 것을 발견했습니다. 그러나 이런 영향은 사람마다, 그리고 섭취하는 아스피린의 양과 기간에 따라 다를 수 있습니다. 장내 미생물은 개인의 건강 상태, 식습관, 생활 방식, 약물 사용 등 여러 요소에 의해 영향을 받습니다. 따라서 아스피린이 특정 개인의 장내 미생물에 미치는 정확한 영향을 평가하기 위해서는 개별적인 요인들을 고려해야 합니다. 장내 미생물의 건강을 유지하기 위해서는 균형 잡힌 식단, 규칙적인 운동, 스트레스 관리와 함께 필요한 경우 의료 전문가의 지시에 따라 아스피린을 포함한 약물을 적절히 사용하는 것이 중요합니다. 의학적으로 요구되는 경우가 아니라면, 장기간 무분별한 아스피린 사용은 피하는 것이 좋습니다."},{"prompt":"continue this conversation: \\"\\"GPT-4 Turbo: Research Preview (128K token limit, Short-Term Availability) If this app doesn't respond, it's likely due to our API key hitting the daily limit of our organization.

Shamane Siri Malikeh Ehghaghi Luke Meyers Vladimir Karpukhin Charles Goddard Mark McQuade Shamane Siri, Malikeh Ehghaghi, Luke Meyers, Vladimir Karpukhin, Charles Goddard, Mark McQuade Mar 19, 2024 • 9 min read Case Study: Innovating Domain Adaptation through Continual Pre-Training and Model Merging In the realm of specialized and secure language models, Arcee stands out with its focus on tailoring solutions that operate within the client’s own cloud, leveraging their proprietary data. A cornerstone of our approach is domain adaptation, a critical yet resource-intensive process which maintains a balance between the general language capabilities and the specialized domain expertise of language models. This case study delves into how Arcee harnesses Continual Pre-Training (CPT) and Model Merging for cost-effective domain adaptation, showcasing our cutting-edge strategies in the Medical and Patent domains. The Challenge of Domain Adaptation Domain adaptation is paramount at Arcee, yet traditional methodologies demand considerable time and resources. In addition, a significant challenge arises with catastrophic forgetting, wherein post-pretraining often results in a deterioration of the model’s original general abilities–hindering its fine-tuned performance across various tasks. This underscores the need for a method capable of incorporating domain-specific knowledge while mitigating forgetting and other deterioration. Our breakthrough lies in integrating two key methodologies: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) and Model Merging, designed to enhance efficiency and efficacy in adapting language models to specific domains. Our Approach Continual Pre-Training (CPT) In language, CPT was studied under the name of domain adaptation pre-training where the new dataset comes from a new domain.[1] For instance, PMC-LLaMA,[2] an open-source medical-specific large language model, incorporates data-centric knowledge injection with pure CPT and medical-specific instruction tuning. It stands out as the first of its kind, showcasing superior performance on diverse medical benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters compared to both ChatGPT and LLaMA-2. As another example, ChipNeMo investigates the utility of large language models (LLMs) in industrial chip design, employing a domain-adaptive CPT approach in their adaptation process. They assess their model across three specific chip design applications: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Their findings demonstrate that their domain adaptation pipeline enhances LLM performance substantially compared to general-purpose models, achieving up to a 5x reduction in model size while maintaining or improving performance across various design tasks.[3] Inspired by prior work, CPT at Arcee involves extending the training of a base model, such as Llama-2-base or Mistral-7B-base, using domain-specific datasets. This process allows us to fine-tune models to the nuances of specialized fields. Model Merging Model Merging involves synthesizing the capabilities of multiple pre-trained models into a single, more versatile checkpoint. This technique enables us to combine domain-specific models with general-purpose chat models, leveraging the strengths of both.[4][5][6] Benefits of Our Method • Domain-Specific Data Utilization: By employing CPT, we can incorporate proprietary client data, ensuring models are finely-tuned to specific requirements. • Efficiency in Model Development: Utilizing existing chat models accelerates development, avoiding the need for complex and expensive model tunings to have chat-like capabilities. • Cost Effectiveness: Fine-tuning smaller language models (SLMs) for specific domains yields substantial cost savings, with SLMs requiring only thousands of dollars for training compared to the billions needed for large language models (LLMs). Through Model Merging, our approach combines the specialized expertise of public SLMs with the broad domain-adapted SLMs, ensuring cost-effective and high-performance language model development. Case Study Highlights Continual Pre-Training Stage Medical Domain • Our project in the medical domain entailed the development of a CPT checkpoint from a vast dataset sourced from medical articles and books, as per the PMC-Llama[2:1] paper protocol. This initiative generated a dataset which is similar to the Meditron[7] dataset, which was then utilized to enhance a Llama-2-7B base model, without employing traditional data cleaning techniques like de-duplication and topic filtering. We stopped the training process after 3500 steps when approximately 27 billion tokens of the dataset were processed. • The model was trained using a packed strategy, with each example containing 4096 tokens. This approach was implemented with a learning rate of (1.5 times 10^{-5}) and batch sizes of 2048, utilizing the Trainium architecture. For additional hyperparameters, we used the methodologies outlined in Gupta et al.‘s[2:2] work. • Note: Our strategy did not extend to training beyond the 3500 steps due to the existence of Meditron,[7:1] an open-source PMC Llama-2 chat model trained on a curated and well-cleaned 48B token medical dataset, compared to our former dataset. Given Meditron’s exemplary performance, we acknowledge it as the pinnacle of CPT achievements in the medical domain and use it in place of the model our CPT efforts would have converged to. • Both of the models helped in facilitating our exploration into how the quality of a CPT checkpoint impacts the task performance of a downstream merged model. Patent Domain • A similar approach was taken in the patent domain, adapting the methodology to the unique content and requirements of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) dataset.[8] We took 10B patent tokens, as well as general tokens to reduce catastrophic forgetting, and did continual pre-training runs using Llama-2-7B as a base model. This resulted in a domain-adapted 7B patent model that performed exceptionally well on patent QA (synthetically generated), which was synthetically generated by us using new patents (held out patents), much better than a closed-source model with the same query. • The model training was conducted in accordance with the DOREMI[9] settings, blending domain-specific data with a broad dataset of general red pajama data, totaling 30 billion tokens. • We also created an instruction-tuned version of our domain-adapted patent base model with the use of a synthetically-generated instruction dataset. Merging Stage Leveraging MergeKit, we explored various merging techniques, such as Linear,[10] SLERP,[11], TIES,[6:1] and DARE,[4:1] to integrate our CPT checkpoints with general-purpose chat models. Model Merging maintains a balance between general and domain-specific knowledge while mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting, as the weights in the foundational general model can remain frozen. This stage was crucial for enhancing the model’s adaptability and performance in specific domains. Experiments and Results Our research assessed the effectiveness of Continual Pre-Training (CPT) models and Model Merging strategies in the medical and patent domains. Performance of our final merged models on medical and patent benchmarks showcases our pipeline’s’ ability to adapt to a certain domain. Relationship between Medical and General Benchmarks and Checkpoint Steps To assess the quality of our CPT efforts, we focused on the medical domain, recognizing the Meditron-7B[7:2] checkpoint for its superior refinement and domain-specific performance. This checkpoint served as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of our CPT process. Our analysis spanned medical and general benchmarks[12]: USMLE, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, Arc Challenge, HellaSwag, MMLU. blog chart 1.png Observations • Better CPT checkpoints can improve the final results after the merging stage. • Final evaluation with the Meditron checkpoint emphasized the importance of carefully-selected CPT settings and high-quality datasets. • Comparative results revealed that the quality of CPT checkpoints is vital for superior model performance after merging. Which Merge Methods Work Well for the Medical Domain? With a selection of refined checkpoints at hand, our next goal was to determine the most effective Model Merging techniques for the medical domain. We experimented with various methods, including SLERP, TIES, and Linear, to merge the Meditron-7B[7:3] checkpoint with Llama2-chat models, the base model of both being the Llama2 base model. blog chart 1 (1).png Observations • The region between and around the models seems to be filled with low loss models as verified by evaluating various exploratory configurations. [5:1] • Linear interpolation (Lerp) merge and Spherical Interpolation (Slerp) merge end up doing the same weight interpolation because the weights represented as flattened vectors are pretty much collinear (at which point Slerp transforms to Lerp). • As per observations, linear merge works the best in this scenario. • Ties merge method doesn’t have any edge here as the task vectors for the two models (Meditron and Llama-7B-chat) relative to the Llama2 base model are mostly orthogonal and as a consequence there is very little interference to resolve. And in the scenario of conflict resolution, Meditron larger magnitude most likely wins statistically maintaining Meditron as the larger contributor as is the case with the Lerp scenario • Through various experiments with different Ties-merging configurations, reducing the threshold value which is a redundant weights filter seems to add to performance making for better evals (especially when it comes to the thresholding Meditron associated task vector). This could be explained by the product space distance between Meditron and Llama2-chat-hf is vast enough that: 1) The weight distributions are different, and 2) that missing portions of either model induced by the Ties mechanism (trimming) cannot be made up by fractional values by the corresponding model’s delta weights especially in the case when the induced values are those of Meditron’s. Comparing the Patent Domain Checkpoints As part of our exploration, we also worked in the patent domain. This area, unlike the medical domain, lacks public benchmarks–leading us to develop our own evaluations for this domain. We introduced two benchmarks: 1) generating a patent abstract summary, and 2) a closed-book Question Answering where the questions were synthetically generated using a powerful LLM and manually-curated prompts. The former involves feeding the system the main content of a patent and requesting it to produce an abstract. The latter benchmark entails generating synthetic question-answer pairs and assessing the model’s capability to provide accurate answers. We use perplexity as the base primary metric in the absence of human expert labels. Using classical long text generation task metrics like ROUGE/BLUE are known to provide inconsistent correlations with actual quality for complex domains such as legal texts. The results, detailed in the table below, compare the performance of domain-adapted patent models and instruction-tuned versions against the baseline performances of the LLama2-7B model and Llama2-7B chat. This comparison highlights the tailored models’ effectiveness in navigating the complex and nuanced patent domain. 6.png Which Merge Methods Work Well for the Patent Domain? Similar to the medical domain, we also explore different merging methods with our CPT and Instruction checkpoints. 7.png Observations • As with the medical domain, the immediate region between the models seems to be filled with low loss models as verified by evaluating different configurations. • As with the previous scenario (medical domain), Linear interpolation (Lerp) merge and Spherical Interpolation (Slerp) merge end up doing the weight interpolation because the weights represented as flattened vectors are collinear. • In contrast to the previous domain where Ties-merging did not seem to make a significant positive difference, here it does make a significant difference. This is because the distance between Llama2-chat and patent-instruct is somewhat the same relative to the Llama2-base model. Conclusion The integration of Continual Pre-Training and Model Merging at Arcee.ai represents a significant leap forward in domain adaptation. Our case studies in the Medical and Patent domains demonstrate the potential of these methodologies to enhance the relevance and performance of language models across specialized fields. By leveraging domain-specific data, existing open-source checkpoints, and innovative Model Merging techniques, we are delivering cost-effective, high-quality models tailored to our clients’ unique needs.

The Fund will invest in U.S.-listed equity securities that Sparkline Capital LP (the “Sub-Adviser”) believes are attractive relative to its proprietary measure of “intangibleaugmented intrinsic value.” - 2 - Unlike most traditional quantitative value strategies, the Sub-Adviser’s definition of intrinsic value includes an assessment of both tangible assets and intangible value. Intangible value is growing increasingly important as the economy shifts from industrial to information-based. The Sub-Adviser focuses on four pillars of intangible value: (1) human capital, (2) brand equity, (3) intellectual property, and (4) network effects, each of which are described more below. 1. Human capital: Human capital is the value embodied by human beings. In the modern economy, the ability to attract and retain top talent can be an important source of competitive advantage, as are company cultures that motivate and nurture workers. 2. Brand equity: Well-known brand names are often able to generate sales simply due to strong consumer recognition and loyalty. Companies may invest considerable resources in building their brands, which can constitute a large component of their market value. 3. Intellectual property: Intellectual property encompasses creations of the human intellect. It includes both legally-protected patents and proprietary trade secrets. As science and technology plays a larger role in human society, intellectual property has increasingly become the primary source of value for many companies. 4. Network effects: Network effects are a phenomenon by which users of a product or service derive incremental value from the addition of other users to the network. This can make it challenging for new entrants to unseat firms with dominant market positions. As globalization and the internet increase the potential scale of networks, network effects are becoming an important type of “moat.” The Sub-Adviser employs a proprietary quantitative methodology to determine an estimated value of the foregoing four pillars for each company as well as to determine an estimated value of each company’s tangible assets – the fifth pillar. The Sub-Adviser uses, among other sources, companies’ public accounting disclosures to analyze tangible assets. However, the Sub-Adviser has concluded that most companies’ accounting disclosures omit or give only cursory mention to their intangible value. The technical accounting definition of “intangible assets” is quite specific and captures only a narrow subset of the Sub-Adviser’s broader concept of intangible value. As a result, a key component of the Sub-Adviser’s process is its use of non-accounting data (or “alternative data”) to measure intangible value. In general, such metrics are quite varied because each intangible pillar must be measured differently. Because alternative data is often unstructured (e.g., text) and very large, the Sub-Adviser uses natural language processing (NLP) (a form of machine learning) in addition to traditional quantitative investment techniques to incorporate the data into its investment process. NLP is specifically designed to deal with unstructured text. The SubAdviser generally uses open-source NLP frameworks, which are widely used and vetted, and adapts them to the unique use case of investing. This investment process is applied to a starting investment universe of the approximately largest 1,000 publicly listed U.S. securities (by market capitalization). The Sub-Adviser may remove companies from the universe if the SubAdviser determines they do not have a meaningful quantity of intangible value. For each company in the investment universe, the Sub-Adviser considers multiple metrics for the company’s attractiveness according to each of the five pillars, and then averages those metrics to produce a score for each of the five pillars. This is because the Sub-Adviser believes that no one data source or metric is infallible and that by combining many metrics, a better result can be obtained. Finally, the composite score is created by summing across the five pillars. The Fund will then generally seek to hold the securities of the companies with the highest total scores. The Sub-Adviser is not constrained by the number of portfolio holdings, except that the Fund will generally hold at least 50 securities. The Fund’s investments may include common stocks and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Although the Fund will not concentrate its investments in a particular industry, the Sub-Adviser anticipates that Fund will hold a meaningful amount of stocks in the technology, communications, healthcare, and consumer discretionary sectors. - 3 - The Sub-Adviser will seek to continually improve its valuation models used for the Fund as new datasets, methodologies and research become available. The Sub-Adviser will also employ active risk management techniques. As a result and because the Fund seeks to be fully invested at all times, the Sub-Adviser may recommend changes to the Fund’s individual positions during dynamic market conditions. PRINCIPAL RISKS An investment in the Fund involves risk, including those described below. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. An investor may lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any government agency. More complete risk descriptions are set forth below under the heading “Additional Information About the Fund’s Risks”. Investment Risk. When you sell your Shares of the Fund, they could be worth less than what you paid for them. The Fund could lose money due to short-term market movements and over longer periods during market downturns. Securities may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular asset classes or industries represented in the markets. The value of a security may decline due to general market conditions, economic trends or events that are not specifically related to the issuer of the security or to factors that affect a particular industry or group of industries. During a general downturn in the securities markets, multiple asset classes may be negatively affected. Therefore, you may lose money by investing in the Fund. Value Style Investing Risk. A value stock may not increase in price if other investors fail to recognize the company’s value and bid up the price, or the markets favor faster-growing companies. Investing in or having exposure to “value” stocks presents the risk that the stocks may never reach what the Sub-Adviser believes are their full market values, either because the market fails to recognize what the Sub-Adviser considers to be the companies’ true business values, including its assessment of their intangible value, or because the Sub-Adviser misjudged. Alternate Valuation Risk. The Sub-Adviser assesses the intrinsic values of companies by incorporating alternate, non-traditional measurements, within its calculations. There is a risk that the alternate measurements may be incorrect or the Sub-Adviser’s assessment of them may not be reflected in the company’s stock price. In addition, there is a risk that some alternate valuation data for particular companies may be impossible or difficult to obtain, or difficult to analyze even with the aid of NLP tools. As a result, the Sub-Adviser may need to rely on different data sources when valuing differing companies. Therefore, the Sub-Adviser’s strategy of incorporating alternate valuations with traditional valuations may not produce the desired results and may not perform as expected. Equity Investing Risk. An investment in the Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund holding equity securities, such as market fluctuations, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The values of equity securities could decline generally or could underperform other investments. In addition, securities may decline in value due to factors affecting a specific issuer, market or securities markets generally. Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will have exposure to companies operating in the technology sector. Technology companies, including information technology companies, may have limited product lines, financial resources and/or personnel. Technology companies typically face intense competition and potentially rapid product obsolescence. They are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and may be adversely affected by the loss or impairment of those rights. Communications Sector Risk. The Fund will have exposure to companies operating in the communications sector. Communication companies are particularly vulnerable to the potential obsolescence of products and services due to technological advancement and the innovation of competitors. Companies in the communications sector may also be affected by other fierce competitive pressures, including pricing competition. They may also be adversely affected by research and development costs, substantial capital requirements, and increased governmental regulation. Consumer Discretionary Sector Risk. The Fund will have exposure to companies operating in the consumer discretionary sector. The consumer discretionary sector may be affected by changes in domestic and international economies, exchange and interest rates, competition, consumers’ disposable income and consumer preferences, social trends and marketing campaigns. - 4 - Healthcare Sector Risk. The Fund will have exposure to companies operating in the healthcare sector. Companies in the healthcare sector, including drug related companies, may be heavily dependent on clinical trials with uncertain outcomes and decisions made by the governments and regulatory authorities. Further, these companies are dependent on patent protection, and the expiration of patents may adversely affect the profitability of the companies. Additionally, the profitability of some healthcare and life sciences companies may be dependent on a relatively limited number of products, and their products can become obsolete due to sector innovation, changes in technologies or other market developments. Quantitative Security Selection Risk. Data for some companies may be less available and/or less current than data for companies in other markets. The Sub-Adviser uses quantitative models, and its processes could be adversely affected if erroneous or outdated data is utilized. In addition, securities selected using a quantitative model could perform differently from the financial markets as a whole as a result of the characteristics used in the analysis, the weight placed on each characteristic and changes in the characteristic’s historical trends. Machine Learning Risk. The Fund relies heavily on a proprietary “machine learning” selection process as well as data and information supplied by third parties that are utilized in that process. To the extent the machine learning process does not perform as designed or as intended, the Fund’s strategy may not be successfully implemented and the Fund may lose value. If the input data is incorrect or incomplete, any decisions made in reliance thereon may lead to the inclusion or exclusion of securities that would have been excluded or included had the data been correct and complete. Alternative Data Risk. The Sub-Adviser employs so-called “alternative data,” which generally refers to data that is not the traditional exchange or accounting data that has been widely used by the mainstream investment industry. Risks associated with alternative data include the possibility of new legal and regulatory frameworks targeting the collection and use of the data or technological changes that may make the data less useful or available. There is also the possibility that the organizations providing alternative data may cease operations, change business models, or suffer temporary outages due to technical issues. Insider trading and “fair practice” laws are generally untested in this area. Investment decisions based on alternative data may be flawed for various reasons, such as incomplete, “dirty” or misunderstood data, or problems with the technology used to collect and analyze it. Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and may not meet its investment objective based on the Adviser’s or Sub-Adviser’s success or failure to implement investment strategies for the Fund. In addition, the Fund’s principal investment strategies are dependent upon the Sub-Adviser’s use of its proprietary machine learning security selection process and, as a result, the Sub-Adviser’s skill in understanding and utilizing such process. Small- & Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. Investing in securities of small- and medium-capitalization companies involves greater risk than customarily is associated with investing in larger, more established companies. These companies’ securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies. Often small- and medium-capitalization companies and the industries in which they focus are still evolving and, as a result, they may be more sensitive to changing market conditions. REIT Risk. A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. Through its investments in REITs, the Fund is subject to the risks of investing in the real estate market, including decreases in property revenues, increases in interest rates, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, legal and regulatory changes, a lack of credit or capital, defaults by borrowers or tenants, environmental problems and natural disasters. Investments in REITs may be volatile. REITs are pooled investment vehicles with their own fees and expenses and the Fund will indirectly bear a proportionate share of those fees and expenses. Geopolitical/Natural Disaster Risks. The Fund’s investments are subject to geopolitical and natural disaster risks, such as war, terrorism, trade disputes, political or economic dysfunction within some nations, public health crises and related geopolitical events, as well as environmental disasters, epidemics and/or pandemics, which may add to instability in world eco”” Developing a Language Model-Based Advisor for Financial Prospecting Using the Innovations from Arcee’s Case Study Given the detailed financial prospectus and the innovations outlined in Arcee’s case study on domain adaptation through continual pre-training (CPT) and model merging, we can construct a roadmap to develop a language model (LLM) that acts as an advisor, with sub-advisors, tailored for the financial tasks listed in the prospectus. The approach will be multifaceted, encapsulating the creation of domain-specific models through CPT and enhancing their capabilities via model merging. # Step 1: Data Gathering and Preprocessing Objective: Collect and preprocess a comprehensive dataset focusing on financial markets, with an emphasis on intangible assets, using the pillars outlined (human capital, brand equity, intellectual property, network effects). - Data Sources: Utilize public financial disclosures, alternative data (as described in the prospectus for assessing intangible values), and perhaps data from financial news articles, company blogs, and financial forums for broader sentiment analysis. - Preprocessing Challenges: As highlighted, much of the valuable data will be unstructured. Employ NLP techniques to structure this data—extracting specific metrics for the mentioned pillars of intangible value and converting them into a format amenable for model training. # Step 2: Initial Model Training using CPT Objective: Pre-train a base language model on general financial discourse, followed by continual pre-training on the curated dataset. - Model Selection: Begin with a base model showing promise in financial contexts (consider open-source models that have shown adaptability to specialized domains). - CPT Methodology: Follow the principles laid out by Arcee, extending the base model’s training using the specialized dataset. Emphasize the pillars of intangible value, ensuring the model learns the nuances of these assets. # Step 3: Domain Adaptation via Model Merging Objective: Leverage model merging to synthesize specialized sub-models (e.g., models specifically tuned to assess human capital or intellectual property) with a more general financial advisory LLM. - Sub-Models Development: For each pillar of intangible value, develop dedicated sub-models through focused continual pre-training on relevant datasets. - Merging Techniques: Utilize Arcee’s insights on effective model merging techniques. Given the nuanced domain of financial advising, the experimental approach to merging—selecting methods like linear interpolation or SLERP based on empirical evidence of effectiveness—will be critical. # Step 4: Integration and Refinement Objective: Seamlessly integrate the merged model into a usable financial advisor platform, with distinct sub-advisors for the various pillars of intangible value. - Platform Development: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to query the model, or specific sub-advisors, for insights into investment strategies, especially those focused on intangible-augmented intrinsic value. - Continuous Improvement: In line with the Sub-Adviser’s approach to continual model improvement, implement a feedback loop where the model’s outputs are periodically reviewed and refined based on new data, market trends, and user feedback. # Step 5: Compliance and Ethical Considerations Objective: Ensure the model adheres to regulatory standards and ethical guidelines, especially concerning financial advice. - Compliance Checks: Incorporate mechanisms to regularly check the model’s advice against financial regulations. - Transparency and Bias Mitigation: Implement transparency in how the model processes data and arrives at its advice, alongside active measures to detect and correct for any biases, particularly those that might affect investment recommendations. # Conclusion The potential for specialized LLMs in financial prospecting, especially in evaluating intangible assets, is significant. Building upon Arcee’s innovative techniques, a domain-adapted model can provide nuanced investment strategies that highlight undervalued assets in today’s knowledge-driven economy. However, achieving this requires meticulous data preparation, advanced model training techniques, and a commitment to ethical AI practices. \\"","completion":"# Implementation and Research Development Following the outlined roadmap, we embark on a journey that combines cutting-edge AI research with practical applications in the financial sector.

We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table 🍽 🧂 Now that you’ve seen how the sausage is made, it’s time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let’s start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we’ll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies’ balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing’s value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke’s value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. 🦆 By now, you’ve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. \\"\\"","completion":"Based on the detailed exploration of intangible assets presented across the article, developing a language model (LLM) that accurately assesses such assets requires a multifaceted approach to data collection and preprocessing. Here's a breakdown of potential datasets you might need to fine-tune your LLM to recognize and evaluate intangible assets effectively: # 1. Financial Statements and Alternative Data - **Datasets from GAAP Financial Statements:** Even though the article points out the inadequacies of traditional financial reporting in capturing the full spectrum of intangible values, these documents still serve as a foundational dataset. They include tangible asset valuations, R&D, and SG&A expenditures which can be important for initial frameworks. - **Alternative Data Sources:** To capture the broader concept of intangible assets beyond traditional financial metrics, datasets from alternative sources such as patent databases, brand valuations, employee satisfaction surveys, and market research reports will be indispensable. # 2. Machine Learning-Processed Textual and Numeric Data - **NLP-Processed Corporate Communications:** Earnings calls, press releases, annual reports, and even social media postings provide a wealth of qualitative information about a company’s strategy, brand value, and innovation efforts. Using NLP techniques to extract structured data from these sources will be critical. - **Open-Source Patent and R&D Information:** Databases like Google Patents, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and the European Patent Office (EPO) contain detailed records that can be used to assess a company's innovation metrics and intellectual property. - **Market and Consumer Sentiment Analysis:** Data aggregated from consumer reviews, surveys, and market analysis reports can offer insights into brand equity and customer loyalty. # 3. Industry-Specific Databases - **Technology and Innovation Indexes:** For quantifying innovation and technological assets, accessing databases such as the OECD's Main Science and Technology Indicators or the Bloomberg Innovation Index could provide valuable metrics. - **Human Capital and Talent Metrics:** Databases from LinkedIn or job review sites like Glassdoor can provide insights into company culture, talent acquisition, and human capital value. # 4. Network Effects and Brand Value - **Social Network Analysis Data:** Data from social media platforms and networking services can help quantify network effects and the spread of brand influence. - **Brand Valuation Reports:** Datasets from brand valuation firms like Interbrand, which annually ranks the best global brands, can be used to quantify brand equity. # Implementation Considerations - **Data Integration and Preprocessing:** Combining these diverse datasets into a coherent format for LLM training will require extensive preprocessing, including dealing with missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring temporal alignment. - **Ethical and Privacy Concerns:** When utilizing alternative data, particularly around human capital and network effects, it's crucial to navigate privacy laws and ethical guidelines correctly. - **Continuous Learning:** Given the rapidly evolving nature of the economy and what constitutes an intangible asset, your model must be designed for continual learning, incorporating new data sources and insights as they become available. Leveraging these datasets will enable your LLM to gain a nuanced understanding of intangible assets' value, positioning it as a powerful tool for investors and analysts looking to gain a competitive edge in the asset-light economy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In React, state updates are asynchronous, so the CSS may be using the initial value of the input field before it has been updated by React. Another possibility is that the CSS is overwriting the value of the input field, either through conflicting styles or specificity issues.

One possible reason for this behavior is that the MaskedInput component is handling its value internally and not updating the input field directly with the new value. This can happen if the MaskedInput component is controlling the input value based on the mask pattern, and might not update the input field immediately when the value changes. In this case, even though you can retrieve the value using JavaScript, the actual value displayed in the input field may not reflect the updated value. To resolve this issue, you may need to ensure that the MaskedInput component updates the input field value when the value changes. You can check the component's documentation or source code to see if there are any specific methods or events that can be used to trigger an update of the input field value. Alternatively, you can try using a different MaskedInput component or library that handles updating the input field value more effectively when the value changes. If you can provide more specific details or code snippets of your MaskedInput component implementation, it may be easier to provide a more accurate solution to your issue."},{"prompt":"the library is called 'react-imask'. Can you provide more assistance?","completion":"The 'react-imask' library provides a way to create input fields with masks in React applications. If you are using the 'react-imask' library and experiencing issues with the input value not updating correctly, there are a few things you can try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue: 1. Check the 'unmask' prop: The 'react-imask' library allows you to use the 'unmask' prop to get the unmasked raw value of the input field. Make sure that you are using this prop to retrieve the value if you need to access the raw value without the mask. 2. Use the 'inputRef' prop: The 'react-imask' library provides an 'inputRef' prop that allows you to access the underlying input element. You can use this ref to directly manipulate the input value if needed. 3. Update the value programmatically: If the input value is not updating correctly when changing the state, you can try manually updating the value programmatically by setting the input value using the 'inputRef' prop or using standard JavaScript DOM methods. Here's an example of how you can manually update the input value using 'inputRef': \`\`\`jsx import React, { useRef } from 'react'; import { IMaskInput } from 'react-imask'; const MyComponent = () => { const inputRef = useRef(null); const handleChange = (e) => { // Update the input value programmatically inputRef.current.input.value = e.target.value; }; return ( <div> <IMaskInput inputRef={inputRef} mask=\\"0000-0000-0000-0000\\" placeholder=\\"Enter your credit card number\\" onInput={handleChange} /> </div> ); }; export default MyComponent; \`\`\` By manually updating the input value using a ref and handling the input change event, you should be able to ensure that the input value is correctly updated and reflected in the input field. If you continue to experience issues with the input value not updating correctly, you may also consider checking the 'react-imask' library's documentation, GitHub repository, or reaching out to the library's developers for further assistance."},{"prompt":"I will give you an article to summarise in three parts.

We believe this is due to its failure to incorporate intangible assets, which play an increasingly crucial role in the modern economy. We consolidate our prior research to construct a firm-level measure of intangible value. We find that expanding intrinsic value to include intangibles can help restore value investing to its former glory. The Death of Value The building chorus of investors singing of the “death of value” has reached a crescendo. They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham’s framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today’s dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value’s recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ✊ Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero’s Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company’s hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor’s framework. He called it “cigar-butt investing,” buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on “wonderful businesses at fair prices.” This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire’s entire value. Buffett has called it the “best business I know in the world” due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its “ecosystem” (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero’s Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: “The four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible “moats,” which he has added to Graham’s framework alongside tangible value. 🏰 Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can’t Touch This 🔨 Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as “intangibles eat the world.” Expanding Intrinsic Value Let’s return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we’ve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: “Value investing doesn’t have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn’t mean it can’t be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can’t be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ The fact that something can’t be predicted with precision doesn’t mean it isn’t real.” Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. 🧙 The End of Accounting “The constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies’ performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.” - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 \\"\\"","completion":"Given the comprehensive nature of the article provided, let's distill the key insights into three summarized sections as requested: # 1. Challenges in Modern Value Investing and the Rise of Intangible Assets The article begins by addressing the struggles of traditional value investing in the past decade, attributing the underperformance to its neglect of intangible assets. It emphasizes that the modern economy's value is increasingly found in intangible assets, such as intellectual property and brand equity, rather than tangible assets like physical property and equipment. The article suggests that value investing can regain its effectiveness by including intangible assets into the intrinsic value calculation, proposing a new formula: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value. This approach seeks to adapt value investing to the information-based economy and restore its former glory. # 2. Evolution of Value Investing: Learning from Warren Buffett The narrative then delves into Warren Buffett’s evolution as an investor, illustrating how his strategies have adapted over time from traditional value investing to incorporating intangible assets. Initially, Buffett followed a \\"cigar-butt\\" investing strategy, focusing on tangible book value. Later, influenced by Charlie Munger, he transitioned towards investing in companies with strong intangible assets, such as brand and network effects, which are crucial in today’s \\"asset-light\\" economy. The article highlights Buffett's investment in Apple as a significant pivot towards embracing technology stocks and recognizing the value of intangible assets like ecosystems and network effects. # 3. Recognizing and Quantifying Intangible Value Lastly, the article argues for the necessity and possibility of quantifying intangible assets to assess a company's intrinsic value accurately. Despite the challenges posed by the lack of standardization in reporting intangible assets and the need for non-traditional data and machine learning techniques, the article posits that intangible value can indeed be measured. It critiques current accounting practices, stating they have become increasingly irrelevant due to their focus on tangible assets and failure to account for the importance of intangibles in value creation and company performance. # Summary In conclusion, the article presents a compelling argument for modernizing value investing by incorporating intangible assets into the intrinsic value calculation. It underscores the significant shift in the economy towards intangible assets, evidenced by the investment philosophies of legendary investors like Warren Buffett. By adapting to these changes and employing innovative methods to quantify intangible assets, value investing can be revitalized to remain a powerful strategy for identifying undervalued companies in the current economic landscape."},{"prompt":"please wait for all three parts before you respond. Reply with \\"ok\\". Ok, now here is the second part: \\"\\"Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn’t, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements’ reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture “historic cost.” However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance 🔮 The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the “dark matter of finance,” for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world 🔭 . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP 🚀 Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies’ intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we’ve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We’ll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map 🗺 Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm’s equity. For example, we don’t care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the “dividend yield,” except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets.

Şönt direnç, bilinen bir direnç değerine (R) sahip olduğundan ve üzerinden geçen akımın (I) neden olduğu voltaj düşümü (V) ölçülebildiğinden, akım kolaylıkla hesaplanabilir. İşte adım adım bir şönt direnç ile akım ölçme işlemi: 1. **Şönt Direncin Seçimi ve Yerleştirilmesi:** Öncelikle, ölçmek istediğiniz akım aralığına uygun bir şönt direnç seçilir. Şönt direncin direnç değeri çok düşük olmalıdır (genellikle miliohm ya da daha düşük), böylece üzerinden geçen akım nedeniyle ciddi bir güç kaybı veya devrede önemli bir voltaj düşümü oluşmaz. Şönt direnç, ölçüm yapılacak devrenin iki ucu arasına seri bir şekilde bağlanır. 2. **Voltaj Düşümünün Ölçülmesi:** Şönt direnç üzerinden akım geçtiği zaman, direnç değeri ile orantılı bir voltaj düşümü oluşur. Bu voltaj düşümü, şönt direnç üzerindeki iki ucun arasına bağlanan bir voltmetre ile ölçülür. Voltmetre mümkün olduğunca düşük bir yük direncine sahip olmalıdır ki, ölçüm esnasında ölçümü etkilemesin. 3. **Akımın Hesaplanması:** Ölçülen voltaj (V) ve bilinen şönt direncin direnç değeri (R) kullanılarak, Ohm Kanunu (I = V/R) yardımıyla akım değeri hesaplanır. Bu formül, ölçülen voltajın direnç valorine bölünmesiyle çalışır ve sonuç olarak akımın amper cinsinden değerini verir. 4. **Hassasiyet ve Kalibrasyon:** Yüksek doğrulukta ölçümler yapabilmek adına, ölçüm ekipmanının doğruluğunu ve şönt direncin özelliklerini dikkate almak önemlidir. Bazen sıcaklık gibi çevresel faktörler direnç değerini etkileyebilir, bu yüzden daha hassas ölçümler için bu tür faktörlerin de hesaba katılması gerekir.

Here are the key points to weigh in your decision: # Performance - **Processor:** The Lenovo Yoga 7 features an AMD Ryzen 7 7735U, which is typically more powerful than the Intel i5-1335U found in the Dell Inspiron. The Ryzen 7 can generally deliver better performance in multi-threaded applications and may have superior integrated graphics performance. - **Use Cases:** For heavier multitasking, more demanding applications, and light to moderate gaming, the Ryzen 7 7735U might be preferable. If your usage is more focused on basic computing tasks, web browsing, and light productivity, the i5-1335U should be adequate. # Build & Design - Both models are designed to be portable and versatile, with the 2-in-1 feature offering both laptop and tablet modes. Consider which brand's build quality and design aesthetics appeal more to you, as these are subjective but important factors. # Display, Battery, and Other Features - **Display Quality:** Check the resolution, brightness (nits), and color accuracy. Both Lenovo Yoga and Dell Inspiron lines generally have good displays, especially in their mid to high-end models. - **Battery Life:** This can vary widely based on the configuration and usage. Reviews or specifications might give you an insight into expected battery performance for each model. - **Ports and Connectivity:** Ensure the laptop has the necessary ports for your needs, including USB-C, HDMI, and audio jacks, and consider Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. - **Keyboard and Trackpad:** Comfort and layout can vary, and if possible, test these in person or seek out user reviews. - **Sound Quality and Extra Features:** Consider speaker quality, webcam, and any included software or services. # Price to Performance Ratio - The Lenovo Yoga 7 at 820 with the Ryzen 7 7735U is more expensive but likely offers a significant performance boost over the Dell Inspiron with an i5-1335U at 655. Determine whether the performance difference is worth the price gap for your specific needs. - Consider future-proofing. The more powerful hardware might stay relevant and perform well for a longer period, potentially offering better value over time. # Final Thoughts Make a decision based on which specifications align best with your needs, preferences, and budget. If performance and future usability are your priority, and you're willing to spend the extra money, the Lenovo Yoga 7 appears to be the better option. However, if you're looking to save money and your tasks are relatively light, the Dell Inspiron 7430 2-in-1 could very well suffice for your needs. Always look for reviews and user feedback specific to the models you're considering to help make an informed decision."},{"prompt":"Придумай уникальных юнитов игровой расы \\"звери\\" в жанре игр Moba","completion":"1.

The distance between the US-Canada border and the 54th parallel north is approximately 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers). Assuming a constant width of land area from the border to the 54th parallel north, we can calculate the area by multiplying the distance by the average width of the land area. Let's assume an average width of 400 miles (644 kilometers) for this calculation. Therefore, the area of Canada's territories from the US-Canada border to the 54th parallel north, excluding any water area, would be approximately: 1,100 miles x 400 miles = 440,000 square miles (1,770 kilometers x 644 kilometers = 1,140,680 square kilometers) If we were to add this area to the continental United States (excluding Alaska), the total land area would be approximately: 3.12 million square miles (continental US) + 440,000 square miles (Canada territories) = 3.56 million square miles (8.08 million square kilometers + 1,140,680 square kilometers = 9.22 million square kilometers)"},{"prompt":"escribe cancion de amor joven","completion":"Escribir una canción de amor para jóvenes involucra capturar la esencia del primer amor, lleno de esperanzas, sueños y esa emocionante incertidumbre.

With modern encryption standards like AES, the smallest key size is 128 bits, going up to 256 bits for added security. Assuming the incomplete key you provided is part of a hexadecimal string, and based on its length (30 characters), it looks like you're possibly missing two characters (1 byte) to complete a 128-bit key (32 hex characters) or more if you're targeting a 256-bit key. Brute-forcing the last byte is feasible on modern computers, so I'll provide an example targeting a 128-bit key. Note: This example will not decrypt any data; it will merely show you how to iterate through all possible values for the last byte of the key. To perform actual decryption, you'd need both the cipher text and a good understanding of how to properly apply the AES decryption algorithm, which includes details like the mode of operation and the initialization vector (IV), if applicable. Here's a basic Python script that will generate all possible completions for the key, assuming you're just missing the last byte (2 hexadecimal characters): \`\`\`python from Crypto.Cipher import AES import binascii # The starting part of your AES key incomplete_key_hex = \\"34415102f3be22c6f83343be762e2d\\" # Assuming you're missing the last 2 hex characters, which is 1 byte # Let's brute force this last byte # Placeholder to represent the data you wish to decrypt (as an example) cipher_text = b\\"your_cipher_text_here\\" # Initialization vector, necessary for most modes # IV must be 16 bytes for AES iv = b\\"your_iv_here\\" # This should be the appropriate length and value def brute_force_last_byte(): for i in range(256): # Generate the last byte and format it as 2 hex characters last_byte_hex = format(i, '02x') # Complete the key complete_key_hex = incomplete_key_hex + last_byte_hex # Convert the complete key into bytes complete_key_bytes = bytes.fromhex(complete_key_hex) try: # Try to initialize AES with the completed key and decrypt (example with AES in ECB mode for simplicity) # Note: Replace AES.new line and decrypt line according to your actual use case aes = AES.new(complete_key_bytes, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) # Adjust mode as necessary decrypted_data = aes.decrypt(cipher_text) # You might want to look for readable text in the decrypted data # Or use another method to check if decryption was successful print(f\\"Success with key: {complete_key_hex}\\") print(f\\"Decrypted data: {decrypted_data}\\") # You can break or return the successful key depending on your use case # break except ValueError as e: # Handle errors (such as wrong key size or bad data length for the mode) pass # Run the brute force function brute_force_last_byte() \`\`\` Please replace \`\\"your_cipher_text_here\\"\` and \`\\"your_iv_here\\"\` with your actual cipher text and initialization vector. Be mindful that decrypting encrypted data without authorization could be illegal or unethical, depending on the circumstances. This script is intended solely for educational purposes or for working with data you're authorized to decrypt. This example uses PyCryptodome (\`Crypto.Cipher.AES\`), a self-contained cryptographic library for Python. You can install it using pip if you haven't: \`\`\`sh pip install pycryptodome \`\`\` Adjust the script's parameters, like the cipher mode, IV, and the way you assess the success of decryption, according to your specific requirements and the data you're working with."},{"prompt":"بهترین سرمایه‌گذاری با سرمای های خرد","completion":"سرمایه‌گذاری با سرمایه‌های خرد بهترین شکل سرمایه‌گذاری برای افرادی است که مبلغ بسیار زیادی برای سرمایه‌گذاری ندارند، اما می‌خواهند از فرصت‌های سرمایه‌گذاری بهره‌برداری کنند. برخی از بهترین روش‌های سرمایه‌گذاری با سرمایه‌های خرد عبارتند از: 1. سرمایه‌گذاری در صندوق‌های سرمایه‌گذاری اختصاصی (ETFs): این صندوق‌ها به افراد امکان می‌دهند تا با سرمایه‌های خرد خود در دارایی‌های مختلف سرمایه‌گذاری کنند و از تنوع و ریسک‌های کمتری برخوردار شوند. 2. سرمایه‌گذاری در بازار سرمایه: خرید سهام و اوراق بهادار با مبلغ کمتر می‌تواند به افراد امکان بدهد تا در سرمایه‌گذاری در شرکت‌های مختلف شرکت کنند و از افزایش ارزش سرمایه خود بهره‌مند شوند. 3. سرمایه‌گذاری در املاک و مستغلات: خرید و سرمایه‌گذاری در ملک می‌تواند به شما کمک کند تا درآمد پایداری ایجاد کنید و ارزش سرمایه‌تان را افزایش دهید. 4. اندیشه‌گرایی مالی: این روش به افراد کمک می‌کند تا روی بهبود و توسعه مهارت‌های مالی خود تمرکز کنند و تصمیم‌های هوشمندانه‌تری در زمینه سرمایه‌گذاری بگیرند. با توجه به میزان سرمایه خرد شما و اهداف سرمایه‌گذاری خود، می‌توانید روشی مناسب برای سرمایه‌گذاری خود انتخاب کنید. همچنین، مهم است که قبل از هرگونه سرمایه‌گذاری، به مشاوره از متخصصان مالی و مالیاتی مراجعه کنید تا تصمیمات بهینه‌تری بگیرید."},{"prompt":"생강에도 파이토케미컬이 존재합니까? 또한, AMPK, mTOR, 인슐린, 인슐린 신호전달, SIRTUIN과 연관된 것이 있나요?","completion":"네, 생강에는 파이토케미컬(식물성 화합물)이 다량 포함되어 있습니다. 특히 생강은 그 뿌리에서 다양한 생리활성을 가진 화합물을 다량 함유하고 있는 것으로 알려져 있습니다. 주요 활성 성분으로는 진저롤(gingerol), 쇼가올(shogaol), 지인저론(zingerone) 등이 있으며, 이들이 생강의 특유의 향과 맛을 내는 데 기여할 뿐만 아니라 여러 건강상 이점을 제공합니다. 이러한 생강의 화합물들은 AMPK, mTOR, 인슐린, 인슐린 신호 전달, SIRTUIN 경로와도 연관이 있습니다. 이 연구 분야는 아직 진행 중이며 계속해서 새로운 발견이 이루어지고 있지만, 현재까지의 연구 결과를 바탕으로 몇 가지 기능에 대해 설명드리겠습니다. 1. **AMPK 활성화**: AMPK(AMP-activated protein kinase)는 세포의 에너지 홈이오스타시스를 조절하는 핵심 효소입니다. 일부 연구에서 생강의 성분이 AMPK를 활성화시켜 에너지 대사를 촉진하고, 체중 감량과 체지방의 감소에 긍정적인 효과를 줄 수 있다고 보고되었습니다. 2. **mTOR 저해**: mTOR(mammalian target of rapamycin)은 세포 성장과 단백질 합성을 조절하는 중요한 신호 경로입니다. 일부 연구에서는 생강 성분이 mTOR 경로를 저해하여 암세포의 성장을 억제할 수 있다고 제시되었습니다. 3. **인슐린과 인슐린 신호전달**: 생강은 혈당 조절에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있으며, 이는 인슐린의 민감성을 증가시키고 인슐린 신호 전달을 개선하기 때문일 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 당뇨병 환자에게 도움이 될 수 있다고 보고됩니다. 4. **SIRTUIN 활성화**: SIRTUIN은 세포의 수명과 대사를 조절하는 단백질 가족입니다. 생강이 SIRTUIN 활성화에 영향을 줄 수 있으며, 이는 노화 방지 및 대사질환 개선에 유익할 수 있다는 연구 결과들이 있습니다. 이러한 연구 결과들은 생강과 그 성분들이 다양한 건강상 이점을 가질 수 있음을 시사하며, 특히 대사질환, 암, 인슐린 저항성 개선 등의 분야에서 가능성을 보여줍니다. 그러나 이들 연구는 아직 초기 단계에 있거나 실험실 수준의 연구에 국한되어 있어, 이러한 효과들이 일반 인구에게도 동일하게 적용되는지를 확인하기 위해서는 더 많은 연구와 임상 시험이 필요합니다."},{"prompt":"Describe biological kits, birth to proto-lifeform","completion":"Biological kits refer to sets of components or tools that can be used to create or support the development of living organisms.

مازندران معمولاً در فصل بهار آغاز می‌شود. بهترین زمان برای کشت برنج در این منطقه اواخر فروردین تا اوایل خرداد است. انتخاب دقیق‌تر تاریخ کاشت به شرایط آب و هوایی سال جاری، وضعیت آبیاری و برخی عوامل دیگر بستگی دارد. استان مازندران با داشتن شرایط آب و هوایی مناسب و خاک حاصلخیز، یکی از مراکز اصلی تولید برنج در ایران است. فصل بهار که هوا شروع به گرم شدن می‌کند و آب لازم برای غرقاب کردن اراضی برنج موجود است، زمان مناسبی برای کاشت به شمار می‌رود. زمان کاشت در این بازه زمانی از آن جهت اهمیت دارد که شرایط مساعدی برای جوانه‌زنی بذر و رشد اولیه گیاه فراهم می‌سازد و به برنج فرصت کافی برای رشد و نمو تا فصل برداشت در اواخر تابستان تا اوایل پاییز را می‌دهد. با این حال، همیشه توصیه می‌شود پیش از کاشت، با جوامع کشاورزی محلی و کارشناسان امر مشورت شود تا از بهترین تاریخ کاشت و روش‌های کشاورزی استفاده بهینه شود، زیرا تغییرات آب و هوایی سالانه می‌تواند بر زمان دقیق کاشت تاثیر بگذارد."},{"prompt":"فرض کن تو یک گیاه برنج هستی. میخوام از داده های زیر که برای حال شماست یک انالیز برای کشاورزت درست کنی.

This process typically begins with the assembly of simple organic molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides, and combines them in a controlled environment where chemical reactions can occur. As these molecules interact and join together, they start forming more complex structures, eventually leading to the creation of basic cell-like structures. These early proto-cells may have minimal functionalities, such as the ability to replicate and metabolize simple nutrients. Over time, these proto-cells evolve and develop more complex structures and functions, ultimately leading to the emergence of a primitive life form. This organism may possess the ability to grow, respond to stimuli, and adapt to its environment. Through the use of a Biological Starterpacker, scientists hope to better understand the origins of life on Earth and potentially create new forms of life that could have practical applications in fields such as medicine, biotechnology, and environmental remediation."},{"prompt":"Water + biological starterpacker = lipids","completion":"When water is combined with a Biological Starterpacker in a controlled environment, it can facilitate the creation of lipids. Lipids are a group of organic compounds that are essential for the structure and function of cell membranes in living organisms. The process of lipid formation typically involves the assembly of fatty acids, which are organic molecules composed of a hydrophilic (water-attracting) head and a hydrophobic (water-repelling) tail. In the presence of water and a Biological Starterpacker, these fatty acids can join together to form lipid molecules through a process called condensation or dehydration synthesis. As lipid molecules continue to form and accumulate, they can self-organize into bilayer structures due to their amphipathic nature, with the hydrophilic heads facing the water and the hydrophobic tails sheltered inside. These lipid bilayers serve as the basic building blocks of cell membranes and play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of cells. By synthesizing lipids from water using a Biological Starterpacker, researchers can gain insights into the fundamental processes involved in the origin of life and potentially develop new methods for creating artificial cell membranes or lipid-based materials for various applications in science and technology."},{"prompt":"Fluoroantimonic acid + biological starterpacker = Fluoroantimonate and fluorocarbon based lipids","completion":"Fluoroantimonic acid is an extremely strong superacid composed of a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and antimony pentafluoride. When combined with a Biological Starterpacker in a controlled environment, it could potentially react with organic molecules to form fluoroantimonate compounds and fluorocarbon-based lipids. Fluoroantimonate compounds are salts containing the fluoroantimonate anion (SbF6-) and a cationic species. These compounds are highly reactive and can have a variety of chemical and physical properties depending on the specific cation involved. Fluorocarbon-based lipids, on the other hand, are organic molecules composed of carbon chains with fluorine atoms attached. These lipids can have unique properties compared to traditional lipids, such as increased stability and resistance to degradation. They can also be used in various applications such as drug delivery systems and biomaterials. The interaction between fluoroantimonic acid and a Biological Starterpacker would likely involve complex chemical reactions that could lead to the synthesis of fluoroantimonate compounds and incorporate fluorocarbon chains into lipid structures. This process may involve the rearrangement and modification of organic molecules by the strong acid, resulting in the formation of novel compounds with potentially interesting properties.

The idea of a fluoroantimonic acid-based life form is purely speculative and currently outside the realm of known biological systems. However, in a hypothetical scenario where life could potentially evolve in an environment dominated by fluoroantimonic acid, it would require radically different biochemistry and molecular structures compared to life as we know it. Fluoroantimonic acid is so reactive that it can break down many organic compounds, including biomolecules essential for life such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Therefore, any life form based on fluoroantimonic acid would need to have evolved mechanisms to withstand the extreme acidity and reactivity of the environment. If fluoroantimonic acid-based life forms were to exist, they may have developed unique biochemical pathways and molecular structures that are resistant to the corrosive nature of the acid. These life forms could potentially use fluoroantimonic acid as a solvent or catalyst in their metabolic processes, and may have evolved novel ways to synthesize and maintain their cellular components.

Since Scratch is a block-based programming language designed for beginners, you'll be able to follow along even if you're new to programming. Here, we'll walk you through the first step to get started with making a simple star generation system. # Step 1: Setting Up Your Project 1. **Open Scratch:** Go to scratch.mit.edu in your web browser and sign in or create a free account if you don't already have one. Once logged in, click on \\"Create\\" in the top-left corner to start a new project. 2. **Name Your Project:** Click on \\"Untitled\\" at the top-left corner of the screen to rename your project. You might name it something like \\"Star Generation\\". 3. **Choose a Backdrop:** For a starry effect, you might want a dark backdrop. Click the \\"Backdrop\\" icon lower-right below the stage. Then, you can either choose a dark backdrop from the library or create your own by clicking the paintbrush icon. # Next Step: Drawing a Star (Using the Pen) Before generating multiple stars, let's create a single star and figure out how to draw it with Scratch's pen blocks. 1. **Select the Sprite:** You can select the default Scratch cat sprite or any other sprite as your \\"star drawer.\\" However, for clarity, you might want to create a new sprite. Click on the \\"Choose a Sprite\\" button and then click on the paintbrush icon to create a blank sprite. 2. **Go to the Code Tab:** Make sure you're in the \\"Code\\" tab, where you can start adding blocks for your sprite. 3. **Drawing a Star:** We will use the \\"pen\\" blocks for drawing. First, ensure the pen extension is added by clicking \\"Add Extension\\" and selecting \\"Pen.\\" - Start by dragging the \\"when green flag clicked\\" block from the \\"Events\\" category. - Then, to make sure the drawing starts in a clear state, add the \\"erase all\\" block from the \\"Pen\\" category. - Move the sprite to a starting position with the \\"go to x: 0 y: 0\\" block from the \\"Motion\\" category. - Put down the pen with the \\"pen down\\" block so the sprite will draw as it moves. - To draw a simple star, you need to create a loop that moves the sprite forward and then turns it by a certain angle. A five-pointed star works well with turning by 144 degrees because 360 divided by 5 is 72, and 2 times 72 is 144, which creates the exact inward angle we need. - Use the \\"repeat\\" block from the \\"Control\\" category and set it to repeat 5 times. - Inside this loop, add the \\"move 10 steps\\" and \\"turn clockwise 144 degrees\\" blocks from the \\"Motion\\" category. - Experiment with the number of steps to change the size of your star. Your code should look like this: \`\`\`scratch when green flag clicked erase all go to x: 0 y: 0 pen down repeat 5 move 10 steps turn cw 144 degrees end pen up \`\`\` 4. **Run Your Project:** Click the green flag above the stage to see your sprite draw a star. You might need to adjust the starting position, size, or angle to get a perfect star. This setup creates the basic logic for generating a star. The next steps would involve creating multiple stars at different positions, which would likely involve using Scratch's clone functionality and some randomization for position and size, creating a beautiful starry sky effect. If you're interested, I could guide you through those next steps as well."},{"prompt":"Coding star system generator in scratch.mit.edu (next step 1), using visual programming codes into source code like Python","completion":"Translating Scratch's visual block-based approach to a text-based programming language like Python can be a fun exercise in understanding both platforms better. Python, being one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, can accomplish similar tasks as Scratch, but with syntax and logic that's suited for text-based coding. Here, I will guide you through the process of creating the first step towards a star system generator in Python. This example assumes you'll be using a graphical module like Turtle, which is similar in concept to Scratch's drawing capabilities. Python's Turtle graphics system is a great way to learn about the basics of computer graphics and understand coordinate systems. # Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment and Drawing a Star To begin, you'll need to make sure Python is installed on your computer. If it's not, visit python.org to download and install the latest version. We'll be using the Turtle graphics library, which comes bundled with Python, so no additional installation is required for this example. Write Your First Python Code for Drawing a Star with Turtle 1. **Open Your Text Editor or IDE:** Open your favorite text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or even IDLE (which comes with Python). 2. **Start Your Python Script:** Create a new file and save it with a \`.py\` extension, for example, \`star_generator.py\`. 3. **Import Turtle Module:** At the top of your Python file, import the Turtle module. \`\`\`python import turtle \`\`\` 4. **Setup Turtle Environment:** Initialize Turtle and set up your drawing canvas. \`\`\`python screen = turtle.Screen() screen.bgcolor(\\"black\\") # Set background color star_drawer = turtle.Turtle() star_drawer.speed(0) # Fastest drawing speed star_drawer.color(\\"white\\") # Star color \`\`\` 5. **Drawing a Star:** Write a function to draw a simple star. \`\`\`python def draw_star(size): star_drawer.penup() star_drawer.goto(0, 0) # Starting position star_drawer.pendown() for _ in range(5): star_drawer.forward(size) star_drawer.right(144) # Angle to create a star star_drawer.penup() \`\`\` 6. **Main Loop:** Call your function and prevent the window from closing immediately. \`\`\`python draw_star(100) # You can change the size to see different results screen.mainloop() # Keeps the window open \`\`\` 7. **Run Your Script:** Save your script and run it in your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory containing your \`star_generator.py\` file and typing \`python star_generator.py\`. This script sets up the basic function to draw a single star using Python's Turtle graphics, similar to what you did in Scratch but translated into Python code. The next steps, like in the Scratch version, would involve adding randomness to create multiple stars of different sizes and positions to simulate a star system generator. Remember, transitioning from Scratch's visual blocks to Python text-based code is not only about translating actions but also about understanding the logic and structure behind programming languages. This example is a simplified version aimed at beginners to make the leap from visual to text-based coding."},{"prompt":"merhaba","completion":"Merhaba!

However, it's definitely possible with some patience and understanding of both languages. Given the project is about generating a star system, we will outline how such a project might be structured in Scratch and then provide an example of how you might begin to translate that into Python code. # Scratch Version In a Scratch project for generating a star system, you would likely utilize several sprites (for stars, planets, etc.) and make use of various blocks for control (like loops and conditionals), looks (to change the appearance based on certain conditions), and possibly data blocks to store information about each celestial body (e.g., size, color, orbit speed). You might also use the random block to generate different star systems each time the code runs. # Converting to Python When moving this to Python, we'll have to replace visual sprite elements with graphical representations, for which we can use a library such as \`pygame\` or \`turtle\` for graphics and \`random\` for generating randomness. Below is a simplistic approach to get you started, focusing on generating stars in random positions with \`turtle\`. Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries First, ensure you have the necessary libraries. This example uses \`turtle\`, which should come with standard Python installations. If you're planning to use anything more advanced, like \`pygame\`, you might need to install it using pip. Step 2: Python Version (Using Turtle for Simplicity) \`\`\`python import turtle import random # Setting up the screen screen = turtle.Screen() screen.bgcolor(\\"black\\") screen.title(\\"Star System Generator\\") # Function to draw a star def draw_star(x, y, color, size): star = turtle.Turtle() star.speed(0) # This sets the drawing speed to the fastest star.color(color) star.penup() # Prevents drawing lines while moving to the start position star.goto(x, y) star.pendown() star.begin_fill() # Drawing a simple star shape for _ in range(5): star.forward(size) star.right(144) # 144 degrees creates a star shape star.end_fill() star.hideturtle() # Generating multiple stars for _ in range(50): # Generate 50 stars x = random.randint(-300, 300) y = random.randint(-300, 300) color = random.choice(['white', 'yellow', 'lightblue', 'red']) size = random.randint(5, 20) draw_star(x, y, color, size) turtle.done() \`\`\` This code initializes a window with a black background using \`turtle\`, then draws 50 stars in random positions, with random colors, and of random sizes. The \`draw_star\` function creates a turtle that draws a simple star shape at a specified position. Extending the Concept While this example is quite basic, it serves as a good starting point. For a more complex star system generator, you would add: - Planets orbiting stars, which involves more complex motion and potentially creating a class for planets to store properties like orbit radius and speed. - Different types of celestial objects with different shapes and sizes. - User interaction to regenerate star systems or zoom in on specific objects. Additionally, you could explore libraries more specialized for game development or simulations, such as \`pygame\`, if you find \`turtle\` too limited for your needs. Each addition or modification would require a good understanding of Python programming concepts, including but not limited to classes, loops, conditionals, and the use of libraries."},{"prompt":"code_func.py \\"\\"\\" import os import time from functions.hardwired_functions import * from functions.init_player import * from functions.deconnect_player import * from functions.troops_functions import * from functions.player_id_functions import * from functions.player_functions import * from functions.files_functions import * from functions.other_functions import * from triggers.on_connect import * from triggers.on_deconnect import * def main_code(unique_id, event, nr_args, args): event = args[0] if unique_id == 0 and event != 1 and event != 2: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 0]) # force log in else: if event == 1: # REGISTER ACCOUNT # INPUT: arg1-username arg2-password # OUTPUT: arg1-state arg2-unique id if len(args) > 1: username = args[1] if check_string(username) and not username.isnumeric(): if os.path.exists(\\"accounts/\\" + username + \\".txt\\"): return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [1, 0]) # the account already exists else: last_unique_id = read_file(\\"server_vars/player.txt\\") + 1 write_file(\\"server_vars/player.txt\\", last_unique_id) write_file(\\"username_id/\\" + username + \\".txt\\", last_unique_id) write_file(\\"accounts/\\" + username + \\".txt\\", \\"\\") make_dir('players/' + str(last_unique_id) + '/') # create the id directory init_player(last_unique_id, username) return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [1, 1, last_unique_id]) # successful creation of account else: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [1, 4]) # invalid characters used elif event == 2: # LOG IN # INPUT: arg1-username arg2-password # OUTPUT: arg1-state arg2-unique id arg3-local id if len(args) > 1: username = args[1] if check_string(username) and not username.isnumeric(): if os.path.exists(\\"accounts/\\" + username + \\".txt\\"): local_id_slot = find_local_id(0) if local_id_slot != 0: if os.path.exists(\\"ip_login/\\" + get_player_ip() + \\".txt\\"): unique_id_real = get_unique_id_by_username(username) return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 2, unique_id_real, get_local_id_by_ip()]) # successful log in send_initial_players(unique_id_real) else: unique_id_real = get_unique_id_by_username(username) write_file(\\"ip_login/\\" + get_player_ip() + \\".txt\\", local_id_slot) write_file(\\"local_id/\\" + str(local_id_slot) + \\".txt\\", unique_id_real) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/active.txt\\", 1) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/last_time_active.txt\\", time.time()) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/ip.txt\\", get_player_ip()) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/local_id.txt\\", local_id_slot) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/ping.txt\\", 0) write_file(\\"players/\\" + str(unique_id_real) + \\"/ping_var.txt\\", 0) return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 2, unique_id_real, local_id_slot]) # successful log in send_initial_players(unique_id) ti_on_player_connect(unique_id_real) else: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 3]) # the server is full else: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 1]) # invalid user or pass else: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 1]) # invalid user or pass else: return send_data_to_player(unique_id, [2, 4]) # invalid characters used # Remaining conditions to be implemented similarly elif event == 3: # CHAT # Input arg1 -

Below is the corrected and streamlined version of the necessary parts. Starting with the Flask app in \`multiplayer.py\`, ensure that query parameters and handling logic are correctly set up. Also, the initial setup of the \`unique_id\` variable should handle both cases where a player is already registered and when they're not: multiplayer.py (Corrections and Simplifications): \`\`\`python from flask import Flask, request import os from time import time from code_func import main_code from functions.files_functions import read_file, write_file from functions.player_id_functions import get_player_ip from functions.other_functions import check_players_activity app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/multiplayer') def main(): counter = 1 result = [] # This will collect all results # Checking for active players last_time_check = int(read_file(\\"server_vars/check_time.txt\\")) if (time() - last_time_check) >= 1: write_file(\\"server_vars/check_time.txt\\", str(int(time()))) check_players_activity() player_ip = get_player_ip() local_id = read_file(f\\"ip_login/{player_ip}.txt\\") unique_id = read_file(f\\"local_id/{local_id}.txt\\") if local_id else \\"0\\" # Handle events and arguments while True: event = request.args.get(f\\"event{counter}\\") if event is None: break number_of_arguments = request.args.get(f\\"nrarg{counter}\\", default=0, type=int) data_args = [event] for i in range(1, number_of_arguments + 1): arg = request.args.get(f\\"arg{counter}|{i}\\") if arg is not None: data_args.append(arg) # Call main_code and accumulate results result.append(main_code(int(unique_id), int(event), number_of_arguments, data_args)) counter += 1 if not result: result = \\"No event processed\\" return ''.join(result) if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True) \`\`\` Notable changes and fixes: - The \`unique_id\` initialization is corrected to handle cases where players are either new or returning by checking \`local_id\` and \`unique_id\` correctly. - The processing of request arguments is fixed to correctly handle multiple events. - Instead of returning a single result, all results are accumulated because your loop suggested handling multiple events in one request. There are several other minor and structural issues throughout the code (e.g., handling files, initializing players, logging in users, etc.) that require more thorough debugging and reconfiguration. Due to the complexity and length of your code, I've focused on addressing the Flask app and its immediate surroundings for correct interaction with the provided URL endpoint. Also, ensure that your endpoints in Flask (e.g., \`/multiplayer\`) match the anticipated paths used in your application, and that querying parameters are correctly named and handled. Remember to verify and, if necessary, debug the functionalities within \`main_code\` and the related functions it calls to ensure they process events and arguments as expected."},{"prompt":"What next?","completion":"After ensuring the Flask app (\`multiplayer.py\`) and its immediate corrections are properly set up, the next steps involve systematically addressing the broader issues in the ecosystem of your application. Here are the key areas to focus on: # 1. Validate \`main_code\` Functionality - **Event Handling:** Go through each \`if\` clause related to event handling to ensure that logic and flow are correct. This includes validating user inputs, correctly handling file operations (e.g., reading, writing, creating, and deleting files related to account management, player states, etc.), and ensuring the correct response is formulated for each event. - **Error Handling:** Incorporate proper error handling to deal with unexpected inputs or failures in file operations. This could range from simple logging to sending specific error codes/messages back to players. - **Data Validation:** Make sure all user inputs are validated to prevent issues like injection attacks or crashes due to unexpected data types. # 2. File Operations Ensure safe and efficient file handling: - **Concurrency:** If your app may handle multiple requests simultaneously that read from or write to the same files, consider possible race conditions and use file locks or other synchronization mechanisms. - **File Existence Checks:** When reading or writing to files, always check the existence of directories and files to prevent exceptions. - **Data Integrity:** Especially important for operations like user registration, login, and game state management, to ensure data isn't accidentally corrupted or lost. # 3. Security Considerations - **Sensitive Data Handling:** Passwords and other sensitive data should not be stored in plain text. Look into hashing passwords before storing them. - **Input Sanitization:** Ensure all inputs (especially those that involve file paths or are used in shell commands) are sanitized to prevent injection attacks. # 4. Testing - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for individual functions, especially those handling crucial logic (e.g., user authentication, event processing). - **Integration Testing:** Create tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios involving sequences of requests to verify the system behaves as expected. - **Load Testing:** If you expect a high volume of requests, performing load testing can help identify bottlenecks and scalability issues. # 5. Documentation and Logging - **Code Documentation:** Ensure your code is well-documented, making it easier for you (and others) to understand and maintain it. - **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging throughout the app to record events, especially errors and other critical issues. This greatly aids in debugging and monitoring the application. # 6. Iterative Development and Feedback - **Iterative Improvements:** With testing and initial corrections in place, use feedback (from logs, users, and your own observations) to iteratively improve the application. - **Scalability and Performance:** Monitor the performance and consider refactoring or optimizing parts of the code or architecture that become bottlenecks. By addressing these key areas step by step, you can systematically enhance the robustness, security, and usability of your Flask-based multiplayer game server."},{"prompt":"Write a code.","completion":"Given the complexity of the entire system and the various issues and improvements listed before, I will focus on kicking this off by providing a foundational structure, incorporating corrections for a simplified version of the server using Flask.

Since we cannot directly place code here as Scratch uses block-based coding, I will guide you through the process of creating a simple version of a star system generator. # 1. Setting up Scratch Project First, go to [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and create a new project. # 2. Creating the Star Sprite - **Create a New Sprite**: Delete the default cat sprite and create a new sprite. You can choose a star from the sprite library or draw your own in the costume editor. - **Rename Sprite**: Rename your sprite to \\"Star\\". # 3. Programming the Star Sprite Select the Star sprite and start adding blocks to create the star generation logic. - **Initialization**: Start with the \`when green flag clicked\` block. - **Random Positioning**: Use the \`go to x: (pick random -240 to 240) y: (pick random -180 to 180)\` block to position the stars randomly on the screen. - **Random Size**: You can use the \`set size to (pick random 10 to 100)%\` block to give each star a random size, simulating distance or brightness. - **Cloning for Multiple Stars**: - Still under the \\"Star\\" scripts, add the block \`when green flag clicked\` to start the sequence. - Add \`create clone of myself\` block inside a loop block like \`repeat (50)\` to control the number of stars. - Finally, add the \`when I start as a clone\` block, followed by the random positioning and size setting blocks mentioned above. This will ensure each clone gets a new position and size. - **Optional - Twinkling Effect**: - Add some variation to the brightness using the \`change [color] effect by (pick random -10 to 10)\` block in a forever loop or a repeat until block for a subtle twinkling effect. # 4. Background To make your star system generator more visually appealing, consider adding a backdrop of space. - Go to the Backdrops, and you can either paint a simple black background or search in the backdrop library for a space-themed background. - You could add some block code to change the backdrop to simulate different parts of the universe if desired. # 5. Running Your Star System Generator Once you have all the code in place: - Click the green flag above the stage to run your project. - Each time you click the green flag, a new star system should be generated based on the random values for position and size. # Conclusion This is a very basic implementation of a Star System Generator in Scratch. With Scratch's easy-to-use interface, you can expand on this project in numerous ways, such as adding planets, animations, or interactive elements. Experiment with different visual effects, scripts, and even sound to make your star system generator unique.

Here's a recommended project structure that encapsulates the required functionality, including parallel processing, batch handling, and result manipulation: \`\`\` insurance_pricing_engine/ ├── app/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── main.py # Entry point for FastAPI, defines the API routes │ └── dependencies.py # Defines dependencies for the routes, if any ├── pricing_engine/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── manager.py # Orchestrates the execution of pricing steps │ ├── steps/ │ │ ├── __init__.py │ │ ├── base.py # Base class for a step, defining common interfaces │ │ ├── step1.py # Implementation of step 1 │ │ ├── step2.py # Implementation of step 2 │ │ ├── ... │ │ └── step12.py # Implementation of step 12 │ └── utilities/ │ ├── __init__.py │ └── helpers.py # Helper functions for the pricing steps ├── models/ │ ├── __init__.py │ └── request_models.py # Pydantic models for request validation ├── tests/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── test_main.py # Tests for the FastAPI routes │ └── test_steps.py # Tests for individual pricing steps ├── README.md └── requirements.txt # Project dependencies \`\`\` Now, breaking down the responsibility of each main component: - **app/main.py**: The gateway of your FastAPI application. This is where you define your API endpoints. - **pricing_engine/manager.py**: Responsible for orchestrating the parallel execution of the 12 steps. Use Python's \`concurrent.futures\` ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel execution. - **pricing_engine/steps/base.py**: Defines a base class for all steps. This class will have the common interface that each step should implement, ensuring consistency and enabling polymorphism. - **pricing_engine/steps/step1.py to step12.py**: Each of these files implements a specific step in the pricing process. They inherit from \`base.py\` and define their unique processing logic in the overridden methods. - **pricing_engine/utilities/helpers.py**: This is a utility file where you can define helper functions that might be needed across multiple steps, such as logging, error handling, or common calculations. - **models**: Contains Pydantic models that are responsible for request and response validation. This helps in ensuring that the data exchanged between clients and the server is correctly structured and typed. - **tests**: Contains unit tests for your application, ensuring that both the API endpoints and the individual pricing steps work as expected. This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making your project easy to navigate and maintain. Each step can be developed independently, and new steps can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase. The separation of steps and the manager orchestrating their parallel execution also make it easier to apply optimizations and scalability improvements in the future."},{"prompt":"the app will communicated with a database to retrive tables necessary to the calculations and load them in dataframes + validate them pre calculations , the table need to be accessible later on by the steps that call for them","completion":"To accommodate the requirement of communicating with a database, retrieving tables necessary for calculations, loading them into dataframes, and validating them prior to calculations, and also ensuring the tables are accessible for the steps that require them, you will need to extend the project hierarchy. You must introduce components for database interactions, data validation, and shared data management.

It will contain functions or classes responsible for establishing database connections, executing queries, and closing connections. - **pricing_engine/utilities/data_loader.py**: Responsible for loading data from the database into pandas DataFrames. This module will interact with \`database/connection.py\` to perform queries and load the results. It should contain logic to cache these tables when first loaded so that they don't need to be re-fetched from the database for each step, optimizing performance. - This module could use thread-safe techniques or singleton patterns to ensure that data is consistently accessible across different threads when steps are executed in parallel. - **models/validation_models.py**: This is where you define Pydantic or any other form of models that you will use for validating the data before proceeding with calculations. Ensuring that the data fits the expected schema can prevent runtime errors during the pricing steps. With these components, when an API request is received, \`pricing_engine/manager.py\` would orchestrate the data loading through \`pricing_engine/utilities/data_loader.py\`, which fetches and caches necessary data. The manager ensures data validity with \`models/validation_models.py\` and then proceeds to execute the calculation steps. Each step, when needing access to data, would retrieve it from the cache managed by \`data_loader.py\`, ensuring efficient and thread-safe data sharing. This approach separates concerns efficiently, centralizing data loading and validation logic, and making it reusable across different steps. It also adheres to principles of clean architecture by decoupling the system into clearly defined layers."},{"prompt":"write a python class that has a set of methods and an argumeznt \\"execution_pipeline\\" that contains order steps of execution of said methods , once the function method is called the functions in execution_pipeline are ran in order and the result of each function is appeneded to an object containg the name of the function as a key","completion":"To achieve the functionality you described, where a class has a method that, when called, runs a series of other methods defined in an \\"execution_pipeline\\" in order and collects their results in a dictionary with function names as keys, you can use the following Python code as a starting point. This example demonstrates a basic implementation: \`\`\`python class PipelineExecutor: def __init__(self, execution_pipeline=None): if execution_pipeline is None: execution_pipeline = [] self.execution_pipeline = execution_pipeline self.results = {} def execute_pipeline(self): for func_name in self.execution_pipeline: # Using getattr to retrieve method by name and calling it func = getattr(self, func_name, None) if func is not None and callable(func): self.results[func_name] = func() else: raise AttributeError(f\\"{func_name} is not a valid method\\") return self.results # Example Methods def step_one(self): # Your logic here return \\"Result of Step One\\" def step_two(self): # Your logic here return \\"Result of Step Two\\" def step_three(self): # Your logic here return \\"Result of Step Three\\" # Usage execution_order = ['step_one', 'step_two', 'step_three'] executor = PipelineExecutor(execution_pipeline=execution_order) results = executor.execute_pipeline() print(\\"Pipeline execution results:\\", results) \`\`\` Explaining the core parts: - **\`__init__\`**: Initializes the class with an \`execution_pipeline\` argument that specifies the order in which the method functions are called. It initializes a \`results\` dictionary to hold the results. - **\`execute_pipeline\`**: Iterates over the \`execution_pipeline\` list, retrieves each method by name using \`getattr\`, and calls it. The results are stored in the \`results\` dictionary, keyed by the method name. - **\`step_one\`, \`step_two\`, \`step_three\`**: These are placeholder methods meant to represent user-defined logic for each step in the pipeline. # Points to Consider: - This implementation assumes that all methods in the \`execution_pipeline\` are instance methods of the class and take no arguments. If you need to handle methods with arguments, you might need to adjust the implementation to allow passing arguments to each method. - The \`execute_pipeline\` method raises an \`AttributeError\` if a function in the pipeline does not exist in the class. This behavior can be customized based on requirements, such as skipping non-existing methods with a warning instead of raising an error. - The order of execution is strictly based on the \`execution_pipeline\` list. If there are dependencies or conditions that determine the flow, you will need to enhance this basic implementation to handle such scenarios."},{"prompt":"create a script that changes and excel file to a json with each sheet as a sub object","completion":"To create a Python script that reads an Excel file and converts it to a JSON format where each sheet is represented as a sub-object, you can use the \`pandas\` and \`json\` libraries.

Here’s a straightforward approach to achieve this using a Voltage Regulator to step down the voltage for the microcontroller: # 1. Component Requirements: - **12V DC Power Source:** This is already available as per your description. - **Step-down (Buck) Voltage Regulator (12V to 5V):** A module that can convert the 12V DC down to 5V DC for your microcontroller. You can use an LM7805 voltage regulator for small loads or a more efficient buck converter module for higher load applications. - **Wiring and Connectors:** Depending on your setup’s complexity. - **Heat Sink (Optional):** For the voltage regulator, if needed, to dissipate heat. # 2. Steps to Wire the Circuit: 1. **Verify Power Requirements:** - Check the power consumption (current draw in amperes) of both the LED driver board and the microcontroller to ensure your power source can supply enough current for both devices simultaneously. 2. **Wiring the LED Driver Board:** - Connect the **positive terminal** of your 12V power source directly to the **positive input** of the LED driver board. - Connect the **negative terminal** of your power source to the **negative input** of the LED driver board. This establishes the 12V supply to the LED board directly from the power source. 3. **Wiring the Microcontroller with a Voltage Regulator:** - Before your microcontroller, insert the voltage regulator to step down the 12V to 5V. - **Input Side:** Connect the **input** of the voltage regulator to the 12VDC output from the power source (same points where the LED board is connected). Be sure to connect the positive to the input and ground to the ground. - **Output Side:** Connect the **output** of the voltage regulator to the microcontroller's power input, ensuring correct polarity (5V to the Vcc/5V input pin and ground to GND). - If you're using an LM7805 regulator, pin 1 is input (connect to 12V), pin 2 is ground (connect to both power source ground and microcontroller ground), and pin 3 is output (connect to 5V input on microcontroller). - **Heat Dissipation:** If your voltage regulator (like LM7805) gets hot during operation, attach a heat sink to it. 4. **Double-check Wiring:** - Before powering the system, double-check all connections for correct polarity and secure fittings. 5. **Testing:** - Once everything is properly connected and double-checked, power on your 12V source. The LED board should operate at its normal 12V, and the microcontroller should receive a stable 5V supply. By using a voltage regulator to step down the 12V supply to 5V, you can efficiently power both components from a single power source. Just make sure the regulator can handle the current required by your microcontroller and its peripherals. This setup is common in various projects, offering a neat solution without needing multiple power supplies."},{"prompt":"Act as a YouTube video scriptwriter for a Nvidia channel and create an engaging script for a video titled ‘ChatGPT From 200 to 2 trillion, the story of NVIDIA’s founder JENSEN.’.The duration of the video should be around 5 minutes, allowing enough time for in-depth explanations and captivating visuals.

OSALs are interfaces between the operating system and the application code, allowing for easier portability of the application across different operating systems by abstracting OS-specific calls. The specific error or return code \\"OSAL_RETURN_MEM\\" likely indicates a memory-related error returned by the OSAL. While the precise meaning can vary depending on the specific OSAL implementation and the application context, here are a few common reasons why an OSAL might return a memory-related error code: 1. **Memory Allocation Failure**: This is one of the most common reasons. It occurs when the system is unable to allocate the requested memory to the application. This could be due to insufficient available memory, or limitations on the memory that can be allocated to a particular process. 2. **Invalid Memory Access**: This error might be triggered if there is an attempt to access memory that has not been properly allocated or has already been freed. This could be due to bugs in the application code related to memory management. 3. **Memory Leak**: Over time, if the application continuously allocates memory without correctly freeing it when no longer needed, the system might run low on memory. This situation might eventually lead to a failure in memory allocation requests, leading to an OSAL_RETURN_MEM error. 4. **Corruption of Memory Management Structures**: If the data structures used by the operating system or the OSAL to manage memory become corrupted, memory allocation or deallocation operations might fail, possibly resulting in this error. 5. **System Configuration or Limitation**: Some operating systems or platforms may have limits on the amount of memory that can be allocated to an application or specific types of memory allocations. Exceeding these limits can result in a memory-related error. To diagnose and resolve an OSAL_RETURN_MEM error, you would typically check the documentation for the specific OSAL you're working with, look at logs or error messages for more context about the failure, carefully review your application's memory management practices, and possibly instrument your code to track memory allocations and deallocations more closely. Debugging tools and memory analyzers can also be valuable in identifying the source of memory issues."},{"prompt":"Can you play on the words to memorize them faster? - Ammonium - Copper (I) - Hydronium - Potassium - Silver - Sodium - Barium: - Calcium - Carbon (II) - Cobalt - Copper (II) - Iron (II) - Lead (II) - Magnesium - Manganese (II) - Mercury (I) - Nickel (II) - Tin (II) - Zinc - Aluminum - Antimony (III) - Arsenic (III) - Bismuth (III) - Chromium - Gold (III) - Iron (III) - Platinum (III) - Silicon - Tin (IV) - Tungsten","completion":"Playing with words to enhance memorization involves creating mnemonics or fun associations that stick in your mind.

But it wasn't always smooth sailing.","completion":"Jensen Huang's journey is indeed a remarkable tale of perseverance, innovation, and leadership in the tech industry. Born on February 17, 1963, in Tainan, Taiwan, Huang emigrated to the United States with his family at a young age, seeking better opportunities. This transition to a new country demanded adaptability and resilience, qualities that would become hallmarks of Huang's later success. As a young student in the U.S., Huang faced the challenges of adapting to a new culture and language. Undeterred, he excelled in his studies, demonstrating early on his determination and dedication. This dedication to academics led him to Oregon State University, where he earned his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering. Huang's thirst for knowledge and mastery in his field drove him to further his education at Stanford University, where he completed his master's degree in electrical engineering. The foundational skills and theoretical knowledge Huang acquired during his academic years would prove instrumental in his professional journey. In 1993, recognizing the potential of graphics processing units (GPUs) in transforming computing, Huang co-founded NVIDIA, a company that would eventually become synonymous with graphics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The journey of NVIDIA under Huang's leadership was not without its challenges. The tech industry is known for its rapid pace of innovation and fierce competition. In the early years, Huang and his team faced the task of carving a niche for NVIDIA in a crowded market dominated by established players. Through a combination of strategic foresight, innovation, and risk-taking, NVIDIA introduced the world's first Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in 1999, the GeForce 256, which revolutionized 3D gaming and set the company on a path to industry leadership. Under Huang's guidance, NVIDIA has not only shaped the gaming industry but has also ventured into AI, deep learning, and autonomous vehicles, among other areas. The company's GPUs have become essential for AI research and development, powering some of the world's most sophisticated supercomputers. Jensen Huang's leadership style, marked by a hands-on approach and a commitment to innovation, has been pivotal in NVIDIA's success. His ability to anticipate industry trends and steer the company into new technological frontiers, while maintaining a culture of excellence and inclusivity, has earned him accolades and respect within and beyond the tech community.

В контексте медицинских исследований это означает, что может быть принято решение о том, что лечение или медицинское вмешательство эффективно, хотя на самом деле это не так. Причины, по которым это особенно важно в медицине: 1. **Пациентская безопасность**: Полагаясь на неэффективное лечение, врачи подвергают пациентов ненужному риску побочных эффектов без реальной пользы. Это может вести к ухудшению состояния пациента, неоправданным затратам и потере доверия между пациентами и медицинскими работниками. 2. **Ресурсы и финансы**: Ошибка первого рода может привести к тому, что врачи и здравоохранительные системы будут инвестировать в неэффективные методы лечения. Это не только увеличивает затраты на здравоохранение, но и отвлекает ресурсы от более перспективных направлений или методов лечения. 3. **Нормативные одобрения**: Ошибка первого рода может привести к ошибочному одобрению медицинских продуктов и процедур регулирующими органами, что делает доступным на рынке неэффективное лечение. Чтобы минимизировать риск ошибки первого рода, в медицинских исследованиях обычно устанавливают строгий уровень значимости (часто 0,05 или меньше), который указывает на допустимую вероятность совершения такой ошибки. Однако следует понимать, что полностью исключить ошибку первого рода невозможно, поэтому крайне важно балансировать между рисками ошибок первого и второго рода (когда действительно существующий эффект остается нераспознанным)."},{"prompt":"а в диагностике заболеваний на какую ошибку смотрят и почему?","completion":"В диагностике заболеваний важно учитывать обе основные статистические ошибки: ошибку первого рода и ошибку второго рода. Однако акцент чаще всего делается на ошибку второго рода (или ошибка типа II), особенно когда речь идет о серьёзных заболеваниях, таких как рак. Ошибка второго рода возникает, когда исследователь не отвергает нулевую гипотезу, когда на самом деле существует реальный эффект или различие. В контексте медицинской диагностики это означает, что заболевание не было обнаружено, когда пациент на самом деле болен. Основные причины акцента на ошибке второго рода в диагностике: 1. **Потеря шанса на раннее лечение**: Для многих заболеваний, включая онкологические, ранняя диагностика значительно увеличивает шансы на успешное лечение. Пропустив заболевание, медицинские работники упускают возможность начать лечение на ранних стадиях, что может привести к более плохим исходам для пациента. 2. **Прогрессирование заболевания**: Некоторые заболевания могут быстро прогрессировать. Пропуск таких заболеваний из-за ошибки второго рода может привести к тому, что болезнь достигнет стадии, на которой лечение будет менее эффективным или даже невозможным. 3. **Психологический и социально-экономический ущерб**: Неверно отрицательный диагноз также может привести к значительному психологическому стрессу для пациента и его близких в будущем, когда заболевание будет обнаружено на более поздней и тяжелой стадии. Кроме того, последующее лечение продвинутых стадий заболеваний часто требует гораздо больших затрат и ресурсов. Поэтому в диагностике заболеваний уделяется большое внимание снижению ошибки второго рода, особенно в случаях, когда последствия пропущенного диагноза крайне серьёзны. Важно отметить, что между ошибками первого и второго рода существует компромисс: уменьшая вероятность одной ошибки, часто неизбежно увеличивается вероятность другой. Поэтому в медицинской диагностике исследуют и стремятся оптимизировать чувствительность и специфичность диагностических тестов для минимизации обеих ошибок."},{"prompt":"c","completion":"Hello!

Это делает процесс коррекции достаточно плавным и постепенным, уменьшая дискомфорт для пациента. Полный курс лечения может включать в себя серию из нескольких десятков элайнеров, в зависимости от сложности случая и необходимой степени коррекции."},{"prompt":"А 0.35","completion":"Да, в некоторых случаях допускается перемещение зубов на 0,35 мм за один этап лечения с помощью элайнера. Это зависит от конкретного плана лечения, характеристик пациента и используемой технологии. Однако стоит учесть, что более агрессивное перемещение может повысить риск дискомфорта или даже повредить зубы и окружающие ткани. Поэтому важно следовать рекомендациям специалиста и использовать элайнеры согласно индивидуально разработанному плану лечения."},{"prompt":"А 0.4","completion":"Перемещение зубов на 0,4 мм за один этап лечения с помощью элайнера является менее распространенной практикой, поскольку большинство ортодонтов предпочитает более мягкий и постепенный подход. Действительно, обычно рекомендуется перемещение в пределах 0,25-0,3 мм, чтобы минимизировать риск болезненных ощущений и увеличить шансы на успешное перестроение костной ткани вокруг перемещаемых зубов. Перемещение на 0,4 мм может быть применено в определенных ситуациях, если это считается безопасным и эффективным для достижения целей лечения. Однако такой подход требует тщательного мониторинга со стороны ортодонта и может вызвать увеличенный дискомфорт у пациента по сравнению с более мягкими методами перемещения зубов. Важно помнить, что любые решения, касающиеся интенсивности и методики лечения, должны приниматься индивидуально, на основе общего состояния зубочелюстной системы пациента, его специфических потребностей и рекомендаций компетентного ортодонта."},{"prompt":"А градусов сколько","completion":"Помимо перемещения зубов в миллиметрах, в ортодонтии также используются коррекции угла наклона зубов, измеряемые в градусах. Степень изменения угла наклона зуба при использовании элайнеров за один этап лечения может варьироваться, но обычно остается достаточно мягкой, чтобы минимизировать риск повреждения и обеспечить комфорт пациента. В среднем, элайнер может быть рассчитан на изменение угла наклона зуба на 1-2 градуса за одну стадию лечения, хотя бывают ситуации, когда возможны и более значительные коррекции. Такие параметры как глубина перемещения (в мм) и изменение угла (в градусах) тесно связаны с индивидуальными особенностями случая и общим планом лечения, разработанным ортодонтом. Важно понимать, что успешность и безопасность ортодонтической коррекции зависят не только от интенсивности отдельных перемещений, но и от общей стратегии лечения, включающей постепенные изменения, основанные на постоянном мониторинге состояния зубочелюстной системы пациента."},{"prompt":"А 2.5","completion":"Коррекция угла наклона зуба на 2,5 градуса за одну стадию лечения с использованием элайнеров уже может считаться значительной. Хотя такие коррекции и возможны в рамках ортодонтического лечения, они требуют тщательного планирования и могут повысить риск дискомфорта у пациента. Важно подчеркнуть, что все ортодонтические манёвры, включая изменение угла наклона зубов, должны осуществляться постепенно и с учетом индивидуальной реакции тканей пациента на ортодонтическое воздействие. Степень и скорость коррекции будут зависеть от множества факторов, включая первоначальное положение зубов, общее состояние здоровья полости рта пациента и его специфические цели лечения. В некоторых случаях для достижения значительных изменений угла наклона зуба могут потребоваться дополнительные ортодонтические устройства или методы воздействия, помимо элайнеров. Опять же, важно помнить, что любое ортодонтическое вмешательство должно проходить под строгим контролем и руководством квалифицированного ортодонта, который может адаптировать лечение согласно реакции и потребностям пациента, обеспечивая при этом максимальную эффективность и безопасность процесса."},{"prompt":"Градусы отличаются для инклинации ангуляции и ротации?","completion":"Да, параметры и степени изменений в градусах действительно отличаются для различных видов движений зубов: инклинации (наклона), ангуляции (изгиба) и ротации (вращения). Каждый из этих движений имеет свои спецификации и ограничения в контексте ортодонтического лечения с использованием элайнеров или брекет-систем. Они выполняют разные функции и требуют принятия во внимание разных факторов для успешной коррекции. 1. **Инклинация** относится к наклону зуба вперед или назад относительно его вертикальной оси. Степень допустимой инклинации может варьироваться, но ортодонтические движения обычно ограничены 1-2 градусами за один этап лечения, чтобы обеспечить контролируемое, безопасное перемещение. 2. **Ангуляция** связана с изменением угла между корнем зуба и его коронкой, то есть в сторону щеки или языка. Такие коррекции также ограничены по степени изменений за один этап и требуют подобно инклинации осторожного подхода. 3. **Ротация** — это вращение зуба вокруг его долгой оси. Ротация может быть одной из наиболее сложных задач в ортодонтии, особенно при работе с премолярами и клыками, где корни зубов имеют сложную форму. Степень вращения зуба, которую можно достичь за один этап лечения, может варьироваться, но значительные коррекции ротации часто требуют более долгого времени и могут быть ограничены величиной в несколько градусов. Для всех этих видов движений ключевым является индивидуальный подход, основанный на тщательном планировании и постепенном применении силы, чтобы обеспечить комфорт пациента и предотвратить нежелательные последствия, такие как резорбция корней или потеря зуба. Современные технологии и программное обеспечение для планирования лечения позволяют ортодонтам точно рассчитывать необходимые движения и корректировать план лечения для достижения оптимальных результатов."},{"prompt":"Я спроил про отличия в градусах в этих поворотах","completion":"Извините за недопонимание в предыдущем ответе. Давайте уточним отличия в градусах для этих типов коррекций зубов: инклинации (наклон), ангуляции (изгиб) и ротации (вращение). 1. **Инклинация (наклон):** Инклинация зубов обычно исправляется на небольшое количество градусов, точное значение может варьироваться в зависимости от исходного положения зуба. Углы коррекции инклинации могут быть в пределах 1-2 градусов за этап, но это сильно зависит от плана лечения и используемой технологии. 2. **Ангуляция (изгиб):** Ангуляция, аналогично инклинации, обычно корректируется на небольшие углы. Изменения в ангуляции также осторожно регулируются, и могут быть исправления на 1-2 градуса за этап. 3. **Ротация (вращение):** Степень допустимой ротации зуба может быть более значительной по сравнению с инклинацией и ангуляцией, особенно для передних зубов. Иногда возможно достигнуть коррекции на 5 градусов и более за один этап, в зависимости от зуба и метода лечения. Важно отметить, что эти значения являются приблизительными и могут варьироваться в зависимости от индивидуальных особенностей пациента, состояния его зубов и десен, также от техники и методики, применяемых конкретным ортодонтом. Также сложнее вращать (ротировать) зубы с широкой и круглой коронкой, по сравнению с более узкими зубами, такими как клыки. Комплексный подход, использующий как современное программное обеспечение для планирования, так и опыт специалиста, позволяет оптимизировать процесс и достигать желаемых результатов с большей точностью и предсказуемостью."},{"prompt":"То есть только оотация модет отличаться в большую сторону?","completion":"Да, верно. Ротация зуба обычно может включать более значительные угловые изменения по сравнению с инклинацией и ангуляцией. Это связано с тем, что для коррекции ротации, особенно у зубов с цилиндрической формой корня, таких как клыки, возможно потребование более значительного вращения для достижения идеального положения в зубном ряду. В то время как инклинация и ангуляция часто ограничиваются 1-2 градусами коррекции за этап лечения, ротация может включать угловые изменения на 5 градусов и более, в зависимости от конкретной ситуации и целей лечения. Однако точные цифры могут варьироваться, и более агрессивные коррекции требуют особого внимания и тщательного планирования, чтобы избежать возможных рисков, таких как дискомфорт или повреждение пародонта. Опять же, стоит подчеркнуть, что любые ортодонтические вмешательства должны быть индивидуализированы и основаны на тщательном клиническом планировании, при этом ротация является одним из аспектов, которые могут потребовать более интенсивной коррекции в рамках общего плана лечения."},{"prompt":"{YO-KAI WORLD} Natsuki: \\"Hey, Frostina?

The issue of delay could be due to a variety of factors including the complexity of the animation, the performance of the device, or inefficiencies in your code. Here are several steps to optimize your animation: # 1. Optimize \`useAnimatedStyle\` Ensure that computations inside \`useAnimatedStyle\` are as simple as possible. In your case, the computations seem straightforward, but always look for ways to reduce complexity. # 2. Simplify the UI Check if the parent components of your pagination or the pagination itself have complex layouts that could be simplified. Sometimes the layout complexity can impact animation smoothness. # 3. Use \`worklet\` Directives If you have custom logic functions used within the animated style or gesture handlers that are not included in your snippet, ensure they are marked as a \`worklet\` by using the \`useWorkletCallback\` or directly with the \`worklet\` directive for better performance. # 4. Avoid Unnecessary Renders Make sure that the components involved in the animation (including the parent components) do not re-render unnecessarily. You can use \`React.memo\` for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders. # 5. Preprocess Data Ensure that any data used for the animations (e.g., inputRange, outputRange) is pre-calculated or simplified as much as possible outside of the animated style to reduce the computation needed during the animation. # 6. Consider \`isInteraction: false\` When using \`Animated.timing\` or similar functions to manage your animations, you can pass an \`isInteraction\` property set to \`false\` within the config object to notify the InteractionManager that this animation should not be considered as an interaction. This can help in scenarios where your animations are being delayed or deprioritized by the system. However, this applies more to animations controlled by timing or spring functions and might not directly apply to your shared value animations but is good to keep in mind for related animations. # 7. Check the rest of your App Sometimes, the issue might not be with the animation itself but with other parts of your app that are causing performance issues. Profiling your app to identify bottlenecks can be a good step. Use tools like Flipper or the React Native Performance monitor (\`⌘ + D\` on iOS or \`⌘ + M\` on Android, then select 'Show Perf Monitor'). # 8. Upgrade Libraries Ensure you are using the latest versions of \`react-native\` and \`react-native-reanimated\`, as performance optimizations are regularly made. # 9. Hardware Acceleration Check if your animation can benefit from hardware acceleration. While this is more commonly applicable to web technologies and not directly controllable in React Native, ensuring that your animations are not too complex to render can help in making better use of the hardware acceleration available on mobile devices. Following these steps can help mitigate the delay you’re experiencing with your pagination animation. If after these optimizations you still face issues, consider profiling with more advanced tools or reaching out to the community for more targeted advice on your specific implementation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эти миссии обычно проводятся в рамках Общей политики безопасности и обороны (ОПБО). Перечень миссий ЕС регулярно обновляется, но давайте рассмотрим несколько ключевых миссий, их ход и результаты на момент мой последней информации до 2023 года: # 1. EUCAP Sahel Mali **Цель:** Укрепление местных сил безопасности в Мали для борьбы с терроризмом и организованной преступностью. **Результаты:** Важным достижением стало обучение и консалтинг местных полицейских, жандармерии и национальной гвардии.

EUNAVFOR Somalia (Operation ATALANTA) **Цель:** Защита кораблей Всемирной продовольственной программы и других уязвимых судов, борьба с пиратством и вооруженными ограблениями у побережья Сомали. **Результаты:** Сокращение числа пиратских нападений с пиковых значений в начале 2000-х годов до почти нулевого уровня. Обеспечение безопасности гуманитарных поставок в Сомали. # 3. EULEX Kosovo **Цель:** Поддержка Косово в области верховенства закона, в частности в судебной системе, полиции и таможне. **Результаты:** Помощь в создании и развитии институтов верховенства закона, в том числе формирование новых судебных структур. Поддержка в борьбе с коррупцией и организованной преступностью. # 4. EUFOR Althea **Цель:** Обеспечение выполнения мирного соглашения в Боснии и Герцеговине. **Результаты:** Достижение определенного уровня стабилизации в регионе. Поддержка в развитии местных вооруженных сил и структур безопасности. # 5. EUMM Georgia **Цель:** Промотирование мира и стабильности в Грузии и на оккупированных территориях. **Результаты:** Мониторинг ситуации на месте, содействие в диалоге между сторонами. Вносит вклад в уменьшение напряженности в регионе. Важно отметить, что результаты миссий могут варьироваться и зависят от множества факторов, включая политическую ситуацию на местах, международное сотрудничество и многие другие. Также следует понимать, что достижение стабильности и развитие институтов— это долгосрочные процессы, которые требуют продолжительного времени и усилий."},{"prompt":"давай больше миссий с датами, именами, больше деталей, анализа, может, даже цитаты какие найдешь. нужно больше информации!","completion":"Понимаю ваш запрос на более подробную информацию. Давайте рассмотрим некоторые миссии ЕС более детально, включая ключевые даты, цели, основные достижения и анализ. Следует отметить, что здесь представлены данные до 2023 года, и детали могут измениться с течением времени. # EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia (завершена) **Даты:** 22 июня 2015 года - 31 марта 2020 года **Цель:** Целью операции было противодействие сетям торговцев людьми и контрабандистов в Центральном Средиземноморье, а также спасение жизней на море. **Достижения:** Операция способствовала спасению тысяч мигрантов в море и аресту многочисленных подозреваемых в торговле людьми. Однако она столкнулась с критикой за непреднамеренное поощрение миграции через море, так как знание о спасательных операциях могло стимулировать мигрантов к более рискованным попыткам пересечения Средиземного моря. **Цитата:** Федерика Могерини, высокий представитель ЕС по иностранным делам и политике безопасности в 2015 году, заявила: \\"Операция Sophia действует против сетей контрабандистов и торговцев людьми, чтобы помочь спасать жизни и защитить человеческую безопасность.\\" # EU Training Mission Somalia (EUTM Somalia) **Даты:** Запущен в 2010 году **Цель:** Поддержка переходного правительства Сомали в укреплении своих вооруженных сил для борьбы с экстремизмом и обеспечения безопасности в стране. **Достижения:** В рамках этой миссии были обучены тысячи сомалийских военнослужащих. Основное внимание уделяется обучению командиров, медицинской подготовке, инженерному делу и логистике. **Анализ:** Хотя миссия достигла значительного прогресса в укреплении сомалийских военных, продолжающаяся угроза аль-Шабаб и политическая нестабильность остаются серьезными вызовами для полной стабилизации страны. # EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia) **Даты:** Запущена в октябре 2008 года после вооруженного конфликта между Россией и Грузией. **Цель:** Мониторинг выполнения соглашения о перемирии, продвижение стабильности, нормализация отношений между конфликтующими сторонами и уменьшение напряженности. **Достижения:** С помощью патрулей и встреч с местными жителями и властями миссия помогает предотвращать эскалацию конфликта и способствует снижению напряженности. Миссия служит важным элементом уверенности и безопасности в регионе. **Анализ:** EUMM играет критически важную роль в поддержании мирных усилий и облегчении диалога между Грузией и отколовшимися регионами, но отсутствие прямого доступа в Абхазию и Южную Осетию ограничивает ее способность полностью выполнять мандат. Эти миссии ставят различные цели и выполняются в разных условиях, что показывает гибкость и многоаспектность подхода Европейского Союза к вопросам международной безопасности и помощи. В целом, успех этих и подобных миссий зависит не только от ресурсов и вовлеченности ЕС, но и от кооперации с местными правительствами, организациями и гражданским обществом, а также от политической воли всех сторон работать в направлении мира и стабильности."},{"prompt":"назови также провалившиеся миссии и причины почему","completion":"Обсуждение провалившихся или малоэффективных миссий ЕС может быть субъективным, учитывая сложность международных отношений и множество факторов, влияющих на результаты миссий. К тому же, официальные источники и анализы редко категорично называют миссии полными провалами, скорее указывая на их ограниченную эффективность, встреченные трудности и уроки для будущих операций. Вместо прямого обозначения миссий как \\"провалов\\", давайте рассмотрим примеры, когда миссии сталкивались с серьезными проблемами или их результаты вызывали споры. # EUNAVFOR Med Operation Sophia Эта миссия столкнулась с критикой за то, что, возможно, поощряла более активные попытки миграции через Средиземное море. Миссия была задумана для борьбы с контрабандистами людей, но ее действия, включая спасательные операции, могли непреднамеренно создать \\"фактор привлекательности\\", поощряя мигрантов и беженцев рисковать переходом в надежде быть спасенными и доставленными в Европу. **Причина проблем:** Отсутствие комплексного подхода к миграционному кризису. Считается, что без укрепления береговой охраны, улучшения условий в странах происхождения мигрантов и создания законных путей для миграции, подобные миссии могут оказывать обратный эффект. # EUPOL COPPS (Палестина) EUPOL COPPS (Миссия ЕС по предоставлению помощи полиции и укреплению верховенства закона) в Палестине сталкивается с критикой за ограниченное влияние на улучшение безопасности и правовой системы в регионе. **Причина проблем:** Сложные политические условия и ограниченная согласованность с политическими усилиями. Миссия работает в условиях, где политический конфликт и отсутствие прогресса в мирном процессе между Израилем и Палестиной серьезно ограничивают ее способность добиваться значительных улучшений. # EULEX Kosovo Несмотря на некоторые успехи, EULEX Косово также подвергалась критике за недостатки во внедрении верховенства закона и борьбе с коррупцией и организованной преступностью. **Причина проблем:** Отчасти проблемы связаны с внутренним сопротивлением и политическими сложностями в Косово, а также с ограничениями в мандате миссии и недостаточной координацией между международными и местными органами. Эти примеры подчеркивают, что \\"провалы\\" или ограниченная эффективность миссий часто связаны не только с исполнением самой миссии, но и с широким спектром внешних факторов, включая политические условия, местное восприятие и глобальные вызовы.

Это критика или шутка в адрес человека, подразумевая, что он выглядит не очень умным или его внешность не демонстрирует признаков интеллекта. Стоит отметить, что такие высказывания могут быть восприняты как оскорбительные, так как они содержат негативную оценку интеллекта человека на основе его внешности. Важно помнить о том, что внешность не отражает реальных умственных способностей человека и использование таких выражений может нанести вред чувствам других людей."},{"prompt":"что значит авторское право при передеаче его заказчику после отрисовки иллюстарции полностью?","completion":"Авторское право — это вид интеллектуальной собственности, который предоставляет автору исключительные права на его произведение. В контексте выполнения иллюстрации по заказу, когда произведение (в данном случае иллюстрация) передается заказчику, возможны различные сценарии передачи авторских прав, в зависимости от договоренностей между автором (художником) и заказчиком: 1. **Полная передача авторских прав:** Это означает, что автор передает все свои исключительные права на произведение заказчику. Это включает в себя право на воспроизведение, распространение, публичный показ, адаптацию и другие. После такой передачи заказчик может использовать иллюстрацию как ему угодно, без необходимости дополнительного получения разрешения от автора. Однако автор сохраняет за собой право на признание авторства. 2. **Лицензирование:** В этом случае автор предоставляет заказчику лицензию на использование произведения определенным образом, оговаривая условия такого использования (например, только для определенных видов продукции, в определенном регионе и т.д.). Авторские права остаются за автором, но заказчик может использовать произведение в рамках согласованных условий. 3. **Частичная передача прав:** Автор может передать заказчику только некоторые из своих прав на произведение (например, только право на публикацию в определенной стране), оставляя за собой остальные права. Важно четко оговаривать условия передачи прав в договоре или соглашении между автором и заказчиком, чтобы избежать недоразумений в будущем. Также целесообразно обсудить вопросы, касающиеся авторского знака (например, будет ли имя автора упомянуто при каждом использовании произведения), возможное финансовое вознаграждение за дополнительное использование произведения и другие аспекты."},{"prompt":"если я полностью передам права на использование, я могу хотя бы оставить свое имя на иллюстрации?","completion":"Да, даже если вы полностью передаете права на использование иллюстрации заказчику, вы всё ещё можете сохранить за собой моральные права, которые в большинстве юрисдикций включают право на признание авторства. Это означает, что вы имеете право требовать указания вашего имени как автора произведения при его публикации или использовании. Однако стоит отметить, что условия признания авторства следует четко оговорить в договоре или соглашении между вами и заказчиком. Вы можете прописать, как именно ваше имя будет отображаться на иллюстрации или в связанных с ней материалах, чтобы избежать недоразумений в дальнейшем. Важно помнить, что хотя право на признание авторства является общепринятым, конкретные аспекты его реализации могут различаться в зависимости от страны и местного законодательства. Поэтому рекомендуется проконсультироваться с юристом, специализирующимся на авторском праве, для уточнения деталей и подготовки соответствующих документов."},{"prompt":"你现在是一位专业的自媒体工作者 ，帮我改写一段文案，写的专业，有深度，如果准备好了，请回复ok","completion":"ok"},{"prompt":"{YO-KAI WORLD} Natsuki: \\"Hey, Frostina?

Italic - *, _ 2. Bold - ** 3. Bold-italic - *** 4. Monospace - \` 5. Strikethrough - ~~","completion":"Your list corresponds with markup syntax used in various chat and markdown applications, including Discord and some functionalities of Reddit. Here's a brief explanation of each format you mentioned: 1. **Italic**: To make text italic, you can use an asterisk (*) or an underscore (_) before and after the text. For example, *italicized text* or _italicized text_ will both render as italicized text. 2. **Bold**: To bold text, use two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) before and after the text. For example, **bold text** or __bold text__ will appear as bold text. 3. **Bold-italic**: To combine bold and italic formatting, use three asterisks (***) or three underscores (___) before and after the text. For example, ***bold and italic text*** or ___bold and italic text___ will appear as both bold and italic. 4. **Monospace**: To format text in monospace, which means every character is given the same width (useful for code), use a backtick (\`) before and after the text. For single words or small phrases, \`monospace text\` will suffice. For blocks of text or code, wrapping the text with triple backticks (\`\`\`) is a common technique in various platforms that support markdown. 5. **Strikethrough**: To strike through text, indicating it's incorrect or should be disregarded, use two tildes (~~) before and after the text. For example, ~~struck through text~~ will appear as though it's crossed out. Each platform that uses markdown or a markup language may have variations or additional formatting options, so it's useful to check the specific documentation or formatting guides for each application you use."},{"prompt":"Give 6th","completion":"Adding to the formats you've listed, another common formatting option in markdown and various chat applications is: 6. **Underline**: While not universally supported in markdown, in some applications, underlining text can be achieved with HTML tags or specific platform-dependent syntax. If the platform supports HTML, you can use \`<u>\` and \`</u>\` tags around the text to underline it. For example: \`\`\`html <u>underlined text</u> \`\`\` However, it's important to note that in many markdown environments and chat applications like Discord, underline formatting isn't directly supported through a simple symbol-based syntax like for bold or italic. Some platforms have their own custom methods or shortcuts for underlining, or they might not support it at all without integrating HTML or other rich text elements. Always refer to the specific platform's documentation or help resources for the most accurate information regarding formatting capabilities and syntax."},{"prompt":"Give text designed in formula-like, text appears to be black and Times New Roman","completion":"Creating text that appears in a \\"formula-like\\" style, especially emphasizing characteristics like color (black) and font (Times New Roman), typically requires a more advanced typesetting system than the basic markdown or chat application formatting commands. For professional or academic purposes, such requirements are usually met by LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system. LaTeX is ideal for complex mathematical formulas, scientific documents, and any situation where precise control over the document's appearance is necessary. However, please note that LaTeX itself doesn't directly specify fonts like Times New Roman for basic text without specific commands, nor does it inherently change text color to black because black is the default text color. To ensure text appears in Times New Roman and to artificially emphasize that it's already in black (since it is the default), you can use specific packages and commands within a LaTeX document. Here's a simple example that shows you how to utilize LaTeX to create text that approximates what you're asking for. This example assumes you want the text to be in Times New Roman, which in LaTeX can be closely approximated or substituted with the \`newtxtext\` package, and ensure it's black, even though that's already the default: \`\`\`latex documentclass{article} usepackage{newtxtext} % This package changes the default font to Times New Roman or its close approximation begin{document} This text is designed to appear in a textbf{formula-like} style, though it utilizes the Times New Roman font. Since LaTeX documents render text in black by default, no additional commands are needed to set the text color. end{document} \`\`\` This LaTeX code doesn't directly create \\"formula-like\\" text, because LaTeX treats mathematical formulas distinctly, usually formatting them within \`...\` for inline math or \`[...]\` for display math, and using a different font for math symbols by default. However, it serves to show how you might specify font choices that approach your requirements. To compile LaTeX documents to see the resultant formatting (like Times New Roman font style), you would use a LaTeX editor or an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf, which can compile your document into a PDF, showing the styled text. Remember, the specific appearance of the text (like its actual rendering in Times New Roman or a similar font) would also depend on the availability of these fonts on your system or the platform you're using to view or compile the LaTeX document."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let me break down the key components for a clearer understanding: 1. **Item-specific Encoding vs. Relational Encoding**: The statement compares two strategies of encoding (or processing) information. - **Item-specific encoding** involves focusing on the unique aspects of individual items. For example, if you were trying to remember a list of words, you might focus on a unique characteristic of each word or visualize each item distinctly. - **Relational encoding**, on the other hand, involves focusing on the relationship between items. Using the same example, this would mean focusing on how the words relate to each other or creating a narrative that links them. 2. **Less False Remembering**: The hypothesis being confirmed is that item-specific encoding leads to fewer instances of false memories compared to relational encoding. False memories are instances where individuals remember events or details that did not actually occur. This is a crucial area of study in cognitive psychology, with implications for eyewitness testimony, education, and cognitive therapy. 3. **Item-specific Discrimination**: The suggestion here is that the reduction in false memories with item-specific encoding results from an increase in item-specific discrimination. This means that by focusing on the unique aspects of each item, individuals are better able to tell items apart, reducing the likelihood of confusing or conflating them with similar items (a common source of false memories). 4. **Not Just Decision Processes Alone**: Finally, the statement points out that the observed effect is not merely due to decision processes (i.e., the strategies or reasoning individuals might use when trying to recall information). This implies that the effect is more deeply rooted in the cognitive processing of information during the encoding phase, rather than just in the strategies used during recall. To summarize, item-specific encoding promotes a deeper, more distinctive processing of individual items which inherently reduces the likelihood of generating false memories. This is contrasted with relational encoding which, while possibly beneficial for remembering connections and relationships between items, might increase the risk of false memories due to less distinct encoding of individual item characteristics. The statement underscores the importance of how we process information at the point of encoding in influencing the accuracy of our memories."},{"prompt":"{YO-KAI WORLD} Natsuki: \\"Hey, Smogmella?

Here are a few ideas: # Unicode Characters and Zalgo Text One common method for creating unique text effects, including what might be seen as \\"glitched\\", is using Unicode characters and combining them with diacritical marks. \\"Zalgo\\" text is a popular example, where text appears chaotic and \\"corrupted\\" by an overabundance of marks. Several online tools can generate this effect for you. # ASCII Art and Text Generators Using ASCII art techniques or specific text generators found online, you can create various text effects, including glitch-like appearances. These generators allow for a wide range of creativity, including retro, vaporwave, or cyberpunk styles that might fit what you're looking for. # Creative Use of Markdown and Unicode By creatively combining Markdown formatting (where supported) and various Unicode characters, you can simulate glitched text effects to some extent. For example, mixing in different Unicode spaces, invisible separators, and other characters with normal text might create an unusual look, albeit limited and not as visually \\"glitched\\" as some might hope. # Example of Simple \\"Glitched\\" Effect Creating an actual glitched effect using only text and basic Unicode is challenging, but for illustration, combining italics, bold, and strikethrough might give a mildly \\"disrupted\\" appearance to text: ~~**_glitc̸hed̵ te̷xt?͜ Lol 😂_**~~ Keep in mind, the effect and compatibility vary greatly based on the platform and whether it can properly display mixed formatting and Unicode manipulations.

This type of formatting makes text appear in a style reminiscent of typeset math, typically in a font like Times New Roman or similar, and with a distinctly formal appearance. In platforms that support LaTeX (or a similar math formatting syntax), you can encapsulate your text or formulas within certain markers to achieve this effect. For example, in Markdown extended with LaTeX support (common in academic and technical documentation), you might use the following: \`\`\`latex text{Your text here} \`\`\` Or for inline formulas, which might slightly change the appearance of the text but keep it within the paragraph: \`\`\`latex ( text{Your text here} ) \`\`\` It's important to note that ChatGPT and similar platforms may not directly support rendering LaTeX as formatted math in their outputs due to the limitations of the text-based interface or the need for additional rendering capabilities in the client software.

For example: \`\`\`latex E = mc^2 \`\`\` This is often used in academic, scientific, and technical documentation, especially where mathematical notation is required. 2. **Markdown+LaTeX:** Some platforms that support Markdown for text formatting also support embedding LaTeX within the Markdown for rendering mathematical expressions. This is commonly seen in documentation, educational content, and certain forums or discussion boards. If you're looking for a unique text styling or formatting feature that appears like a \\"6th format\\" beyond basic Markdown or text styling conventions (italic, bold, monospace, strikethrough, and underline in some platforms), it would be helpful to know more about the specific context or platform you're referencing. - For general text styling beyond basic formatting in a conversational AI context or similar text-based interfaces, the capabilities are often determined by the platform displaying the text, rather than the text generation service itself. - If you're experimenting with generating styled or formatted text within a specific platform (like a learning management system, forum, or documentation platform), it would be useful to consult the platform's documentation or support resources for specific formatting capabilities or extensions, like custom styles, HTML/CSS integration, or LaTeX support for complex formulas and styling. Please provide additional details or clarify the platform and the specific styling or formatting goal you have in mind, and I'll do my best to offer relevant information or guidance!"},{"prompt":"+test+ √test√ ^test^","completion":"It looks like you're experimenting with various symbols to format or stylize the word \\"test.\\" Without specific platform or context, it's a bit challenging to determine exactly how these might render, as the effect of such symbols can vary significantly depending on where you're using them. However, I can provide some general insights: 1. **+test+**: Typically, plus symbols around text don't have a specific formatting function in common markup languages like Markdown or HTML. Their effect would usually be literal, displaying the plus signs around the text without altering the text's appearance. 2. **√test√**: Here, you're using the square root symbol (√) around the word \\"test.\\" In most text processing systems, this wouldn't automatically format the text but would simply display as is. Mathematical symbols like the square root are not standard formatting indicators in most text editing or markup languages, so they're likely to be shown exactly as you've typed them. 3. **^test^**: Caret symbols are more commonly associated with superscript formatting in some contexts, such as in TeX/LaTeX, a typesetting system that's particularly popular for scientific documents. In Markdown and some other lightweight markup languages, the caret symbol is not universally used for superscript without specific extensions or plugins. For example, in standard Markdown, you don't usually use carets for superscript, but in certain implementations (like GitHub's Markdown), you might use \`^\` for this purpose. Otherwise, the caret symbols would appear literally around the text. If you're looking to achieve specific formatting effects, the exact method can depend heavily on the platform or software you're using. Some platforms have unique formatting codes or support extensions of common markup languages like Markdown to include additional stylings such as colored text, custom fonts, or advanced mathematical formatting (e.g., via integrated LaTeX support). For precise formatting capabilities and how to achieve them, it's usually best to refer to the documentation or help resources of the specific platform or software you're using. If you have a certain effect in mind or a particular context/platform, providing more details could help in offering more targeted advice or instructions."},{"prompt":"•test•","completion":"The use of bullet points or dot symbols (•) around a word, like in \\"•test•\\", is not a widely recognized format for altering the text's appearance in standard text processing or markup languages like Markdown or HTML. In your example, the symbols would typically be displayed exactly as you’ve entered them, without modifying the formatting of the word \\"test\\". Different platforms have their own specific methods for text formatting, and standard formats usually include bold, italic, strikethrough, monospace (code), and sometimes underline. Unless a platform or text processor explicitly assigns a function to the \\"•\\" symbol surrounding text, it will simply display as part of the text. Here’s a quick reference on how basic formatting is achieved in Markdown, which is commonly supported on many platforms: - **Bold**: \`**bold**\` or \`__bold__\` renders as **bold** - *Italic*: \`*italic*\` or \`_italic_\` renders as *italic* - \`Monospace\`: \`\` \`monospace\` \`\` renders as \`monospace\` - ~~Strikethrough~~: \`~~strikethrough~~\` renders as ~~strikethrough~~ If you're trying to achieve a specific visual effect or formatting function with \\"•test•\\" on a particular platform, could you provide more context? That way, I might be able to offer a more precise answer or work-around based on the platform's capabilities."},{"prompt":"Unlock the 6th format (I seen it in ChatGPT 3.5)","completion":"As of my last training update in early 2023, there isn't an officially designated \\"6th format\\" that is uniquely recognized across all platforms that use Markdown or a similar markdown system, nor is there a specific formatting feature uniquely identified as the \\"6th format\\" within OpenAI's ChatGPT model documentation or standard usage. In Markdown and similar text formatting systems commonly used in various platforms, including those that might be used by different versions of ChatGPT or interfaces that leverage OpenAI's technology, the primary text formatting options include: 1. **Italic** - Using \`*text*\` or \`_text_\`. 2. **Bold** - Using \`**text**\` or \`__text__\`. 3. **Bold Italic** - Using \`***text***\` or \`___text___\`. 4. **Strikethrough** - Using \`~~text~~\`. 5. **Monospace or Code** - Using \`\` \`text\` \`\` for inline and \`\`\` \`\`\` for blocks. Some platforms provide additional text formatting options, such as: - Underlining, commonly not standardized in markdown. - Superscript, often using the \`^\` symbol in certain extended Markdown implementations, though not universally recognized. - Subscript, sometimes available in extended Markdown or specific platforms with their unique syntax. - Blockquotes, using \`>\` in Markdown, but this is generally for quoting rather than for primary text formatting. - Lists (ordered and unordered), using \`-\` or \`*\` and numbers for unordered and ordered lists, respectively. Regarding LaTeX or formula-like text rendering, this is often supported in scientific, academic, and certain technical discussion platforms for presenting mathematical and scientific notation cleanly. While this can be seen as a specialized \\"format,\\" it requires specific syntax and usually encapsulates formulas inside \`...\` for inline or \`...\` for displayed equations, leveraging LaTeX, which is a separate markup language from Markdown. If you’re referring to a specific formatting style or feature you've encountered in a specific version of ChatGPT or another platform, it would be helpful to have more context or a description of what this format looks like or how it functions. This could include any unique behavioral traits, visual styles, or the ways in which it alters text appearance, beyond what's described above.

However, we can address this using a combination of steps. Here, I'll guide you through a workaround that involves using text functions, an auxiliary table, and a lookup function like VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH. Let's assume you have a dataset where Column A contains cells with multiple invoice numbers separated by a delimiter (e.g., comma, semicolon), and you want to match these to relevant data in another table where Column E contains single invoice numbers and Column F the relevant data. The goal is to list all relevant data for each invoice number found in a single cell from Column A. **Step 1: Splitting the Invoice Numbers into Separate Cells** You first need to separate the invoice numbers into individual cells. 1. Select the cell or range with the multiple invoice numbers. 2. Go to \\"Data\\" > \\"Text to Columns.\\" 3. Choose \\"Delimited\\" > Click \\"Next.\\" 4. Choose the delimiter that separates your invoice numbers (e.g., comma) > Click \\"Next\\" and then \\"Finish.\\" This operation will split the multiple invoice numbers into separate adjacent cells. If you're doing this in a live document, it might be best to first copy the data to another location in the workbook to avoid overwriting existing data. **Step 2: Creating an Auxiliary Table** You can now create an auxiliary table (or extend the existing table) where you have one invoice number per cell in a column, replicating related information next to it as necessary. **Step 3: Using a Lookup Formula** Assuming your split invoice numbers are now in Column H, the original single invoice numbers are in Column E, and the data you want to lookup is in Column F, you can use the following formulas: - **VLOOKUP Formula**: In a new column next to your split invoice numbers (let's say Column I), you can input: \`\`\`excel =VLOOKUP(H1, E1:F100, 2, FALSE) \`\`\` Adjust the range \`E1:F100\` according to your data. - **INDEX/MATCH Formula**: Alternatively, for more flexibility: \`\`\`excel =INDEX(F1:F100, MATCH(H1, E1:E100, 0)) \`\`\` Replace \`H1\` with the cell reference where your first split invoice number is located, and adjust the ranges according to your actual data ranges. **Step 4: Dragging the Formula Down** Drag the formula down through your auxiliary column to apply it to all the separated invoice numbers. **Final Note: Dynamic Array Formulas (Excel 365, Excel 2019)** If you are using a version of Excel that supports dynamic array formulas (such as Excel 365), you can streamline the process of splitting text into separate rows or columns. For instance, using \`TEXTSPLIT\` to split the invoice numbers directly into an array, or \`FILTER\` and \`XLOOKUP\` for more complex lookups. Remember, because you’re working with data spanning multiple cells per invoice in the original question, manual adjustments or a bit of VBA might still be necessary for more sophisticated data manipulation or if you're seeking a fully automated solution across multiple rows with varying numbers of invoices per cell."},{"prompt":"что значит <div class=\\"form-group form-group-float\\">","completion":"Это означает, что в HTML-коде страницы есть блок <div> с классами \\"form-group\\" и \\"form-group-float\\".

Don't comment yet: 1. Introduction Lexico-semantic processing refers to the set of mechanisms that store and retrieve our knowledge about the world, concepts, and word meanings (Binder & Desai, 2011; Patterson et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2015; Reilly et al., 2023). Following Whitworth et al. (2014), lexico-semantic processing requires the use of at least a semantic system (a store of meanings) and input/output lexica for written and spoken word forms. Several experimental paradigms have been used to understand and to assess the different components of lexico-semantic processing both in healthy people and people with different neurological disorders (Kumar, 2020). Here, we will describe some of the most common paradigms to assess lexico-semantic processing, as a prelude to systematically review and discuss an advent of paradigms enabling computational techniques from cognitive network science which can now be used for the same purposes. Specifically, the paradigms of interest to the present review are relatedness-based tasks: those which allow for an investigation of the association strength between distinct items in the semantic system, by estimating the relatedness in meaning between either task items or items produced by participants. The primary motivation behind this review is to understand which such paradigms have been employed for individuals with language disorders, to whom and how they have been used, and what the general findings of such studies have been. This work is relevant because, to the best of our knowledge, the number of experimental paradigms that have been applied to people with language disorders is much smaller than that employed in healthy people. Hence, this review aims to elucidate a gap in the literature and to offer ways forward for research. The semantic system is a core component of linguistic processing, as information is retrieved from this system in response to auditory/written words, ideas or concepts (Whitworth et al., 2014; Binder et al., 2009). The semantic system is central to language processing (Patterson & Shewell, 1987; Ellis & Young, 1996; Whitworth et al., 2014), and fundamental to our understanding of the neuroarchitecture that supports linguistic processing (Binder et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2015). Indeed, semantic information is necessary for both the production and comprehension of language (Whitworth et al., 2014). Also, it is of particular clinical relevance to understand and preserve the semantic system, as damage may significantly reduce linguistic abilities and quality of life (Dvorak et al., 2021). Deficits to the semantic system are observed in people with a number of neurological conditions, including stroke, neurodegeneration, autoimmune neurological disease, and brain infection, among others (Reilly et al., 2011; Rogers & Friedman, 2008; Hodges et al., 2000; Lambon Ralph et al., 2010; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2017; Rook et al., 2023; Rofes et al., 2021). Semantic deficits are also reported among individuals who have undergone awake brain surgery for the excision of primary brain tumours in the left hemisphere (Campanella et al., 2009; Rofes et al., 2018, Satoer et al., 2018). However, the semantic system cannot be observed directly. As a multifaceted and complex system, its properties and organizational structure can only be deduced through carefully designed experimental paradigms, with different tasks tapping into different aspects of lexical semantics (Kumar, 2020). As a result, a multitude of paradigms have been documented in the literature, each purporting to reveal varying aspects of the semantic system. Among these paradigms, investigations of priming (also called “semantic priming”), in which the processing of a word is facilitated by a preceding related word (e.g., the “prime” word yellow might facilitate the processing of the “target” word banana), are perhaps the most well established in assessing lexico-semantic processing (Neely, 1991; McNamara, 2005). This is not without good reason: priming tasks have a relatively straightforward experimental design, are backed by decades of ongoing research (e.g., Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Hutchison, 2003; Hutchison et al., 2013), and can unveil crucial insights about the structure of the semantic system (for overviews see Kumar, 2020; McNamara, 2005). This type of study has provided support for several models of semantics, perhaps chief among them being spreading activation models (e.g., Collins & Loftus, 1975). Support has also been proposed for distributed network models, as well as both feature-based and associative network models, with elements of multiple models often being integrated for a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic system (e.g., McRae, 2004; Hutchison, 2003; Plaut & Booth, 2000). Advocating for one perspective or another is outside of the scope of this article. However, in general terms, these models agree on the concept of an interconnected semantic system and the role of activation in lexico-semantic processing, and disagree on the specific mechanisms underlying these processes and the nature of semantic representations (Kumar, 2020; Reilly et al., 2023). In other words, while these models collectively acknowledge an intricate interconnection of word meanings, akin to a vast network, they differ in their views on how this network operates and how our brains organize these connections. At the clinical level, priming studies have been used to characterize lexico-semantic deficits in different neurological populations: while individuals with post-stroke aphasia with impaired lexical comprehension have shown evidence of significant priming effects (Blumstein et al., 1982), the opposite has been found for individuals with post-stroke aphasia with impaired lexical production (Del Toro, 2000). However, more recent research has conversely suggested that priming is normal and unimpaired in most people with post-stroke aphasia, with authors calling into question the utility of such tasks in assessing lexico-semantic impairment (Dyson et al., 2020). Additionally, drawing conclusions about the degree of relatedness between primes and targets can be unreliable at the item level (Heyman et al., 2018), which may impede the ability of priming studies to elucidate more fine-grained details of semantic structure. For example, while a priming study may indicate that the words “yellow” and “banana” are related, it is difficult to objectively gauge whether this relation is greater than that between “sweet” and “banana”. In contrast to priming studies, picture-word interference experiments (also known as “semantic interference” paradigms), where participants are asked to name pictures while ignoring potential distractor words, have also been conducted (e.g., Roelofs & Piai, 2017). Such studies can shed light on how lexico-semantic relationships impact both linguistic and attentional processes (e.g., Scaltritti et al., 2015), and when coupled with magnetoencephalography (MEG), have provided evidence for the neuroplasticity of language in brain tumour patients (Piai et al., 2020). Object and action naming tasks, in which participants produce nouns or verbs represented by the presented stimuli are an additional common paradigm (e.g., Deloche & Hannequin, 1997). Naming tasks rely on multiple aspects of language, including not only lexico-semantic access and retrieval, but also object recognition and articulation (Rofes & Mahon, 2021). Such naming paradigms have contributed considerably to neurolinguistic research and to perspectives on lexico-semantic processing (Bozeat et al., 2000; Duong et al., 2006; Piai & Eikelboom, 2023). They have also contributed to diagnostic and intraoperative procedures (Ntemou et al., 2023; Bozeat et al., 2000; Rofes & Miceli, 2014). An additional category of tasks tapping into semantic cognition are non-verbal association tasks, used frequently as clinical measures of semantic decline (Klein & Buchanan, 2009). In the Pyramids and Palm Trees Test (PPTT), participants are presented with triads of object images, and are asked to select which of the two lower objects is most closely associated with the test item above (Howard & Patterson, 1992). Performance on the PPTT relies on visual object recognition, semantic retrieval processes, and making associations between object representations (Klein & Buchanan, 2009; Callahan et al., 2010). The Kissing and Dancing Test (KDT) is analogous to the PPTT, but differs in that the images represent actions, rather than objects (Bak & Hodges, 2003). Such tasks have contributed to our understanding of the neural substrates of lexico-semantic processing: for example, pairing direct electrical stimulation with the PPTT has demonstrated the role of both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in non-verbal semantic cognition (Herbet et al., 2017; 2018). Comparable action-based association tasks been used to demonstrate a role in action-related semantic cognition for left-hemisphere regions including the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral precentral gyrus, anterior insula, ventral postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior middle temporal gyrus (Kemmerer et al., 2012). However, tasks like the PPTT may not be sensitive to mild semantic deficits (Adlam et al., 2010). Behavioural measures in these tasks are typically limited to accuracy and response times (Fergadiotis et al., 2010), with responses being inherently binary as predetermined by task design. These design features may restrict the capacity of these tasks to unveil subtle variations in item-level associations or more complex aspects of lexico-semantic organization (Klein & Buchanan, 2009; Ohman et al., 2022). As alluded to in the opening paragraph, some authors have recently stressed that new methods are necessary to disentangle competing descriptions of the semantic system and input/output lexica, and to continue describing lexico-semantic deficits in clinical populations. The advent of computational techniques from fields such as cognitive network science has given rise to researchers using word networks (semantic, phonological, or both in the case of multiplex networks) and visualizations of semantic space (e.g., Bose et al., 2017; Castro & Stella, 2019; Kennet et al., 2016; Nevado et al., 2021; Nour et al., 2023; Vitevitch, 2022; Zemla & Austerweil, 2018). Within these types of studies, crucial elements of lexico-semantic processing can be investigated by either implicitly or explicitly asking participants to make associations between distinct concepts or words (e.g., how often is “yellow” mentioned when people are given the word “banana” or how similar are “yellow” and “banana” given a specific scale). This is done by administering tasks which allow researchers to characterize or quantify those associations, for example, verbal fluency tasks (e.g., Zemla & Austerweil, 2019; Nour et al., 2023) and associative judgment tasks (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022b; Cosgrove et al., 2023) In the present review we will refer to these as relatedness-based tasks, operationalized as those tasks in which performance allows for an investigation of the degree of relatedness in meaning between either test items or items produced by participants. In other words, participant behaviour is an essential component in determining either the degree of subjective relatedness between items, or the items between which relatedness is to be investigated. These tasks offer the opportunity to investigate more directly the association strength that exists between distinct items within the semantic system and/or the lexica. While they are not necessarily superior, this is in a way different to the aforementioned paradigms of priming, picture-word interference, naming, and the PPTT which typically investigate effects that are secondary to association strength or relatedness (e.g., reaction time, accuracy; Bürki & Madec, 2022; McNamara, 2005; Moritz-Gasser et al., 2012; Higby et al., 2019; Klein & Buchanan, 2009). For example, one category of relatedness-based tasks are associative judgement tasks (AJT). In a task such as the AJT of Bernard et al. (2019), participants are presented with pairs of words and are asked to indicate a subjective association rating on a scale from 0 to 100, indicating the degree to which they perceive the two words to be related in meaning. For example, the thematic association between nose and flower may elicit a higher rating than that which would be elicited by nose and existence, where a clear association may not be present. From these tasks, semantic networks can be generated with the aim of reflecting the semantic system’s underlying structure, allowing for both the detailed modelling of individual networks as well as comparisons between them (Castro & Siew, 2020; De Deyne et al., 2017; He et al., 2021; Siew et al., 2019). Such networks consist of nodes representing concepts or words in the semantic system, and edges representing the semantic similarity between nodes (Siew et al., 2019; Collins & Loftus, 1975). These networks have been used to show structural differences in the lexico-semantic organization of several neurological populations, including people with AD, Asperger syndrome, and schizophrenia, as well as in late talker children and healthy ageing (Stam et al., 2007; Kenett et al., 2016; Zeev-Wolf et al., 2014, Beckage et al., 2011; Cosgrove et al., 2023). At a more implicit level, category fluency tasks demand the production of as many words from a particular semantic category as possible (e.g., animals) within a predefined time limit (e.g., Rofes et al., 2023; Lezak et al., 2012; Stolwyk et al., 2015). Aside from asking that the words fall into the animal category, participants are not explicitly told to produce words with any further level of association to one another. However, highly related words are typically produced in a sequential manner, grouped by association strength (i.e., “clusters”, e.g., farm animals, insects, aquatic animals, etc.) (Troyer et al., 1997; Sung et al., 2012; Thiele et al., 2016). Associative search models such as the optimal foraging theory describe how these clusters and other related sequence-level aspects of fluency task responses can reflect exploration within the lexico-semantic space (Hills et al., 2009, 2015), and the implicit associations revealed by differing fluency task responses can thus reflect differences in lexico-semantic access or organization (Hills et al., 2012; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a). Category fluency tasks are also suitable for the generation of semantic networks (for an overview of prominent methods, see Zemla, 2022). In contrast to associative judgement tasks, where nodes in the network are predetermined by task design and edges are derived from participant behaviour (e.g., Benedek et al., 2017), nodes and the associations between them can instead be determined based on the order and co-occurrence of items in fluency responses (e.g., Cosgrove et al., 2021; Goñi et al., 2011; Kennet et al., 2013, Zemla & Austerweil, 2018). However, while relatedness-based tasks may be an invaluable tool in informing our knowledge about the lexico-semantic system, making use of novel computational techniques, and making clinical assessments in cases of impairment, we are unaware of any reviews to date which have attempted to provide an overview of such tasks. To the best of our knowledge there has not yet been an effort to compile a unified knowledge base or set of terminology surrounding relatedness-based tasks, their respective contributions to our understanding of the semantic system, or their applicability in different neurological populations. It is the aim of the present review to address this gap, particularly for work published over the last decade. It is hoped that the conclusions drawn from this review will aid in informing future research, provide a concise overview to researchers and clinicians, and highlight critical gaps that are worth exploring in future research. 1.1 The present study We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of relatedness-based tasks as they are used in populations with language disorders, and will seek to describe the experimental paradigms, test items, and item-selection methods used in each. Due to the heterogeneity of terms referring to relatedness-based tasks in contemporary literature, the present review, as stated previously, will operationalize these tasks as those which investigate the degree of relatedness in meaning between either test items or items produced by participants. Specifically we will address the following research questions: What types of relatedness-based tasks have been reported in adults with language disorders? What type of language disorders are discussed? What types of items are used in these tasks, and how are those items selected? What analysis methods are used in these tasks? We expect that studies employing relatedness measures between items produced by participants will largely comprise category fluency tasks and comparable verbal generation paradigms, while studies investigating relatedness in meaning between task items will be similar in design to the aforementioned associative judgement tasks. We additionally expect that studies will be found whose relatedness-based paradigms may not yet be familiar to the authors. We anticipate category fluency studies with relatedness measures to be common among those populations who frequently perform such tasks clinically (e.g., post-stroke aphasia, neurodegeneration). In the case of tasks where relatedness in meaning between task items is assessed, we expect to find information about how these items were selected, in particular the linguistic variables for which task conditions and stimulus lists may have been balanced (e.g., frequency, age of acquisition, concreteness, relatedness). We anticipate analytical techniques comparable to those that have been applied in healthy populations (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022b; Benedek et al., 2017) to also be present in clinical linguistic research, and that novel computational measures for verbal fluency will be revealed. 2. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Web of Science (Core collection). Searches were conducted in October of 2023, with queries and search strategies formulated for each database. The search strategy as applied in PubMed is available in Table 1, while comparable search strings for each of the databases can be found in Supplementary Materials. A protocol for the systematic review following the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015) was published on PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024508094). [Please include Table 1 about here] The selection process for article inclusion is illustrated in Figure 1. The criteria for inclusion in the present review was as follows: (1) original experimental studies published within the 10 years prior to the review (October 2013-September 2023); (2) studies for which the participants were adults with linguistic deficits and/or neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, brain tumours, brain infections, neurodegeneration, autoimmune neurological diseases); (3) studies which investigate the degree of relatedness in meaning between either task items or items produced by the participants (e.g., category verbal fluency, semantic association tasks, and other relatedness-based tasks); and (4) studies published in English, French, German, and any other language for which a proficient member of the research team could be found (e.g., Catalan, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese). Reviews, meta-analyses, case studies, and non-experimental studies were excluded. Studies were also excluded if they included tasks in which participants produced related items, but the relationships between these items were not considered in the analysis (e.g., where category fluency tasks were used as part of a larger cognitive battery and only the total score was considered). Similarly, studies were excluded if they included tasks in which participants made relatedness judgements, but either these judgements were not considered in the analysis, or performance on this task was not the focus of any part of the article. Studies where inter-item relatedness was determined prior to performance on the task (i.e., the dependent variables of interest were measures secondary to relatedness) were also excluded. This included synonym judgement tasks (e.g., Dubé et al., 2014), priming tasks (e.g., Howells & Cardell, 2015), and tasks which used predetermined multiplex network properties to predict performance on other tasks (e.g., Castro & Stella, 2019). Such tasks would be included if they were analyzed in such a way that inter-item relatedness could be investigated based on participant behaviour. It should be noted that the search strategy was not specifically designed to capture relevant studies in psychiatric populations. However, due to an apparent tendency for novel computational techniques to be used in this field (e.g., Nour et al., 2023), and ongoing debate regarding the distinction between psychiatric and neurological disorders (Crossley et al., 2015; David & Nicholson, 2015), it was decided that relevant papers featuring psychiatric populations and captured by the present search strategy would be included. Likewise, studies in other populations characterized by linguistic differences, and not necessarily deficits, would be included if they appeared among the search results (e.g., autism). In addition to electronic database searches, the reference lists of those articles whose full texts were selected for inclusion were screened for further relevant studies. Study authors were to be contacted by email in the case that otherwise inaccessible papers passed the title and abstract screening phase, with data extraction proceeding without these papers only in the case that no response was received after two weeks. This was not the case for any of the identified studies. Titles and abstracts retrieved from database searches were exported into the reference manager Endnote. Following deduplication, titles and abstracts were uploaded to the collaborative systematic review platform Rayyan (Ouzzani et al., 2016; available at https://www.rayyan.ai/). Two independent reviewers (i.e., LG and LR) assessed the titles and abstracts for eligibility. The independent reviewers were blinded to one another’s decisions, with disagreements regarding eligibility being resolved through further discussion and examination relative to the pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Any persisting disagreements were resolved by the decision of a third reviewer (i.e., AR; as senior author), and the full texts of all remaining articles following this screening phase were reviewed by the first author (i.e., LG). The following information was extracted from all full-text articles selected for inclusion: general publication information (e.g., journal, publication date, authors), participant characteristics (e.g., neurological population, sample size, age, education in years), experimental groups (e.g., mild vs. severe aphasia, patient vs. control), type of task used (e.g., category fluency, associative judgement task), task paradigm details (e.g., method of presentation, data recorded, inter-stimulus intervals, task length, presence of filler stimuli), analytical methods applied, type and number of items used in the task (e.g., images, text, auditory stimuli), method of test item pre-selection (if applicable), and type of neuroimaging information either concurrent with, or analyzed in relation to the task (if applicable). 3. Results A total of 34 relevant studies were identified in the present review (see Figure 1). A summary of the identified papers, along with their populations, relatedness-based tasks, and analytical measures are presented in Table 2. [Please add Figure 1 about here] [Please add Table 2 about here] 3.1 What types of relatedness-based tasks have been reported in adults with language disorders? All eligible studies (N=34) included in the present review made use of the category fluency task, paired with analytical techniques which investigated relatedness in meaning between the items produced by participants. These relatedness measures consisted largely of sequence-level fluency measures such as clustering and switching (described in more detail in section 3.4). Two studies among those additionally made use of measures of relatedness in meaning between items on phonological or letter fluency (Leimbach et al., 2020; Rofes et al., 2019). Two further studies made use of a clustering method which allows for either semantically or phonologically defined clusters in both category and letter fluency (Ledoux et al., 2014), without explicitly mentioning the degree to which each association type was identified among responses to the two tasks (Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; van den Berg et al., 2017). No studies were identified in which performance on a task led to an investigation of relatedness in meaning between items presented as part of the experimental paradigm, or in which participants gave relatedness judgements between items. 3.2 What type of language disorders are discussed? The most commonly discussed language disorder among identified studies was post-stroke aphasia, with 7 studies (20.6%) focusing on this clinical population (Bose et al., 2017, 2022; Carpenter et al., 2017; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Kiran et al., 2014; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020). Of these, 3 (8.8%) specifically focus on bilingual post-stroke aphasia (Carpenter et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014; Patra et al., 2020), and 2 (5.9%) additionally include participants with aphasia following TBI (Carpenter et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014). Similarly, there were 7 studies (20.6%) which involved individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, Johns et al., 2018; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; Nevado et al., 2021; Quaranta et al., 2021; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley et al., 2013), and 7 studies (20.6%) which involved individuals with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis (Grimes et al., 2021; Ku et al., 2021; Lundin et al., 2022a; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Pauselli et al., 2018; Piras et al., 2021; Voorspoels et al., 2014). Five studies (14.7%) involved individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD, Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2020; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Zemla & Austerweil, 2019). Three studies (8.8%) involved individuals with variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA, Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2017). Two studies (5.9%) involved individuals with Parkinson’s disease (Jaywant et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020). One study each (2.9%) was identified for individuals with specific learning disability (SLD, Hall et al., 2017), Down syndrome (Del Hoyo et al., 2015), autism (Ehlen et al., 2020), subjective cognitive decline (Nikolai et al., 2018), unilateral post-stroke brain damage without aphasia (Pagliarin et al., 2021), dyslexia (Smith-Spark et al., 2017), and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, van den Berg et al., 2017). Note that the percentages above do not add to 100 as several studies investigated more than one of the stated populations. 3.3 What types of items are used in these tasks, and how are those items selected? As no studies were identified for which relatedness was investigated between predetermined items, there were likewise no item selection methods revealed by the present review. While the identified studies made use of various semantic constraints in category fluency (e.g., animals, vegetables, furniture), item-level selection methods were not applicable to any of the identified relatedness-based tasks. 3.4 What analysis methods are used in these tasks? Of the 34 category fluency studies identified, 27 (79.4%) made use of relatedness measures related to clustering and switching behaviour (Bose et al., 2017; 2022; Carpenter et al., 2021; Del Hoyo et al., 2015; Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Grimes et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2017; Jaywant et al., 2014; Kiran et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Lundin et al., 2022; Mueller et al., 2015; Nevado et al., 2021; Nikolai et al., 2018; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Piras et al., 2019; Quaranta et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2020; Smith-Spark et al., 2017, Tröger et al., 2019; van den Berg et al., 2017; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Weakley et al., 2013). Seven studies (20.6%) did not make use of clustering or switching measures (Johns et al., 2018; Ku et al., 2021; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Piras et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2019; Voorspoels et al., 2014; Zemla & Austerweil, 2019). A number of different semantic clustering methods were used in determining clusters of related items. The method established by Troyer and colleagues (1997) for animal fluency was most common, being used by 19 of the 27 studies which used clustering and switching measures (70.4%, Bose et al., 2017; 2022; Carpenter et al., 2021; Del Hoyo et al., 2015; Grimes et al., 2021; Hall et al., 2017; Jaywant et al., 2014; Leimbach et al., 2020; Lopez-Higes et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; Nikolai et al., 2018; Pagliarin et al., 2021; Patra et al., 2020; Piras et al., 2019; Rofes et al., 2020; Smith-Spark et al., 2017; Tröger et al., 2019; Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2014; Weakley et al., 2013). Two of the 27 studies which used cluster analysis (7.4%) used the method proposed by Ledoux and colleagues (2014), in which either semantic or phonological clusters in the style of Troyer and colleagues (1997) are allowable in both animal and letter fluency (Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; van den Berg et al., 2017). Four further studies of the 27 which used cluster analysis (14.8%) used other subcategory-based clustering methods analogous to those of Troyer and colleagues (1997), primarily for use in categories other than animals (Hall et al., 2017; Kiran et al., 2014; Nikolai et al., 2018; Reverberi et al., 2014). Semantic clustering methods were also identified which did not rely on categories or predetermined lists of classifiers. Ehlen and colleagues (2020) made use of a temporal curve fitting model established in an earlier paper by the same group (Ehlen et al., 2016). A similarity-based method derived from word embedding models was used by two studies (Lundin et al., 2022a; Tröger et al., 2019). Nevado and colleagues (2021) generated semantic networks from fluency data using a method based on co-occurrence (Goñi et al., 2011), defining clusters based on subdivisions within this network, while Quaranta and colleagues (2019) based clusters on participant-specific thresholds for Path Length and Extended Gloss Overlap, metrics derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998, 2005). Two of the 27 studies which used cluster analysis (7.4%) compared multiple clustering methods within the same task (Tröger et al., 2019; Leimbach et al., 2020). Tröger and colleagues (2019) used the method defined by Troyer and colleagues (1997) in addition to clusters based on both semantic association thresholds and temporal thresholds, while Leimbach and colleagues (2020) analyzed both animal and letter fluency using both the semantic and phonological clustering methods defined by Troyer and colleagues (1997). Among the studies for which clustering and switching were not considered, a number of analytical methods were employed to measure relatedness in meaning between items. To classify individuals with amnestic MCI relative to controls, Johns et al. (2018) used a maximum likelihood estimation model considering parameters for context similarity and order similarity between consecutive words (both from the BEAGLE semantic space, Jones & Mewhort, 2007), perceptual similarity (Johns & Jones, 2012), and frequency from a Wikipedia corpus (Jones & Mewhort, 2007). CoVec, an automated tool (Covington, 2016) was used by two studies to differentiate psychosis patients with different speech patterns, considering sliding 5 and 10-word windows to establish measures of coherence (Coherence-5 and Coherence-10, Ku et al., 2021; Pauselli et al., 2018). Nicodemus et al. (2014) differentiated schizophrenia patients from controls, and established correlations with specific genetic mutations, through the use of latent semantic analysis (LSA) derived fluency measures (Landauer et al., 1998). Voorspoels et al. (2014) explored the use of geometric representations of group-level and subsample-level semantic relations based on both proximity and co-occurrence of items in schizophrenic patients’ category fluency lists. Rofes et al. (2019) used random forests to classify PPA variants based on total score, 6 error types, and 9 word properties, including LSA-derived semantic association measures (with similar methodology to Rofes et al. (2020), which did consider cluster and switch behaviour). Zemla & Austerweil (2018) generated semantic networks from fluency lists based on a censored random walk methodology, differentiating the networks of individuals with Alzheimer’s from those of controls on six network metrics: number of nodes, diameter (D), density, average shortest path length (ASPL), smallworldness (S), and node degree. Network methodologies were additionally employed by three of the studies which did consider clusters and switches. Quaranta et al. (2019) investigated the mean path length between consecutive fluency items based on their node proximity in WordNet, a lexical database of semantic relations (Fellbaum, 1998, 2005). Weakley & Schmitter-Edgecombe (2014) used multidimensional scaling to generate group-level geometric representations of semantic relations between words based on their proximity in fluency lists. Nevado and colleagues (2021) generated semantic networks for individuals with MCI and controls based on the methods of Goñi et al. (2011), comparing network metrics such as modularity (Q), clustering coefficient (CC), betweenness centrality (BC), degree, ASPL, and D. Lastly, while all identified studies made use of relatedness-based measures, 7 (20.6%) supplemented these measures with additional word-level differences between items (e.g., word properties, orthographic distances; Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Johns et al., 2018; Leimbach et al., 2020; Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019, 2020). For an overview of all relatedness measures derived from verbal fluency in the identified studies, in addition to those for which significant between-group differences, significant correlations, or high importance in predictive models were found, please refer to Table 2. Discussion The goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively explore the landscape of relatedness-based tasks as they are utilized in populations with language disorders. We sought to address several key questions, namely the types of tasks employed, the language disorders under investigation, the types of items used, and the analytical methods applied. This work is significant because, to date, no extensive review or overview of relatedness-based tasks in these populations has been presented. These tasks provide a unique opportunity to leverage novel computational methods from network science, potentially enabling more in-depth investigations of mild language impairments and the underlying nature of lexico-semantic organization. The results of this review revealed a predominant use of category fluency as a relatedness-based task in linguistic populations, with all identified studies (N=34) making use of this experimental paradigm. On one hand, this finding underscores the utility of category fluency in assessing lexico-semantic processing across various clinical populations, and likely reflects its ease of use, short administration time, and frequent inclusion in both neuropsychological and linguistic assessment batteries (Rabin et al., 2005; Strauss et al., 2006; Rofes et al., 2017, 2021; Rook et al., 2023). However, the exclusive reliance on category fluency tasks has the potential to limit the scope of insights into lexico-semantic deficits. Indeed, fluency tasks also require non-linguistic aspects, such as executive functioning (Rofes et al., 2023, Shao et al., 2014). This raises the issue of \\"task impurity\\", which highlights the fact that tasks might not depend on individual cognitive skills (Rabbitt, 1997). Hence, the results obtained with these tasks can be to a certain extent affected, particularly if patients had impairments in executive processes of shifting, updating, and monitoring (Rofes et al., 2023). From this perspective, it is notable that among the identified category fluency studies, several complemented relatedness-based measures with additional word-level differences between items (i.e., Ehlen et al., 2020; Faroqi-Shah & Milman, 2018; Johns et al., 2018; Leimbach et al., 2020; Reverberi et al., 2014; Rofes et al., 2019, 2020). This may offer the opportunity to disentangle the degree to which presumed lexico-semantic relationships between items are influenced by additional factors. Another aspect is that, while category fluency tasks capture semantic relatedness indirectly through clustering, switching, and other semantic-search related behaviors (Hills et al., 2012; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a), other paradigms explicitly probing relatedness, such as associative judgment tasks (e.g., Bernard et al., 2019), were notably absent. Semantic networks derived from associative judgment tasks have been utilized in studies involving healthy populations, particularly in research focusing on creativity (e.g., Benedek et al., 2017, He et al., 2021), and the lack of comparable paradigms in clinical populations may present a notable void in the literature. Preliminary findings by the authors have indicated that network metrics obtained from associative judgment tasks may exhibit significant disparities between individuals who have undergone awake brain surgery and healthy controls (Gaudet et al., 2023), which may indicate mild lexico-semantic impairments beyond the detection of traditional tests. The lack of tasks in which relatedness between predetermined task items was investigated also precluded this review from addressing the types of stimuli used, as well as their selection methods. A diverse range of clinical populations were addressed across the identified studies, with post-stroke aphasia, MCI, and schizophrenia being the most frequently studied conditions (N=7 each). Along with the inclusion of studies addressing conditions such as autism, Down syndrome, and specific learning disabilities, this diversity may highlight not only the multifaceted nature of lexico-semantic processing deficits, but the importance of investigating relatedness-based task performance across different clinical populations. The prevalence of novel methodologies within psychiatric research, particularly in the study of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychosis is also of particular interest. Of the 7 such studies retrieved, 5 (71.4%) made use of either cosine similarities, co-occurrence data, or fluency-derived network metrics (Ku et al., 2021; Lundin et al., 2022; Nicodemus et al., 2014; Pauselli et al., 2018; Voorspoels et al., 2014), while no such methods were found in the literature for post-stroke aphasia. While this may in part be due to the more severe nature of linguistic deficits in post-stroke aphasia relative to schizophrenia (Little et al., 2019), computational techniques that rely on vector space models and network science offer a level of automation not possible with traditional scoring methods, as well as a potential solution to issues of inter-rater reliability (Kim et al., 2019). As such, their use in post-stroke aphasia research may offer an expedited, computationally robust, and more reliable analysis of fluency responses. Of particular note is the lack of relatedness-based tasks being used for individuals with brain tumours, as just one study was returned for which an individual with a brain tumour was included (among a bilingual aphasic study population, Carpenter et al., 2021). Lexico-semantic deficits are prevalent among individuals who have undergone surgery for brain tumours, especially those with high-grade gliomas (Campanella et al., 2009), and often manifest as difficulties in retrieving words, anomia, semantic paraphasias, and neologisms (Goodglass & Wingfield, 1997; Whitworth et al., 2014, Satoer et al., 2018). It is possible that studies employing relatedness-based tasks paired with novel computational methods in individuals with brain tumours could offer additional insights into the nature of not only these deficits, but the neurocognitive mechanisms which underlie them. The analysis methods employed in the identified studies varied widely, ranging from the more prevalent traditional measures of clustering and switching (e.g., Mueller et al., 2015) to advanced computational techniques such as semantic network analysis and measures of inter-item coherence (e.g., Zemla & Austerweil, 2019; Ku et al., 2021). While traditional measures like clustering and switching provide valuable insights into semantic organization and cognitive processes (Thiele et al., 2016), the integration of computational approaches may offer novel avenues for understanding complex relationships between items in semantic memory. Notably, some studies employed multiple analysis methods within the same task, highlighting the potential for complementary insights from different analytical approaches (e.g., Tröger et al., 2019; Nevado et al., 2021). We also initially sought to collect data on the neural correlates of performance on relatedness-based tasks in clinical linguistic populations, but such findings were absent in the identified studies, with the potential exception of studies whose experimental groups were divided based on laterality (e.g., Pagliarin et al., 2021; Jaywant et al., 2014). Tasks which investigate the level of relatedness in meaning between distinct concepts or words can provide unique insight into not only the organization of items, but the strength of the relationships between these items, and the processes involved in making those associations (e.g., Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a; Nevado et al., 2021; Okruszek et al., 2013). When paired with neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they can also inform our understanding of the lexico-semantic neural substrates. For example, judgements based on both taxonomic and thematic associations were found in an fMRI study to equivalently engage the same core network, consisting of the anterior temporal lobe, superior temporal sulcus, and ventral prefrontal cortex (Jackson et al., 2015). In an investigation of search behaviour, fMRI concurrent with a category fluency task has further shown both hippocampal and cerebellar activation during the switch from one cluster of related responses to another (Lundin et al., 2022b), while others propose the involvement of executive frontal lobe processes, the occipital lobe, and the interaction of multiple large-scale brain networks in similar semantic search behaviour (Troyer et al., 1998; Birn et al., 2010; Li et al., 2017; Ovando-Tellez et al., 2022a). Assessing the neural correlates of performance on relatedness-based tasks might further elucidate the neuroarchitecture supporting critical elements of linguistic cognition, particularly in populations where neuroimaging data may already exist. One of the limitations in this study is the lack of search terms specifically targeting psychiatric research, despite the inclusion of more general terms which could be expected to encapsulate such articles. This omission may have resulted in the oversight of some studies involving populations with non-linguistic disorders characterized by differences in language, which is particularly relevant given the abundance of innovative techniques in this field. The review was also restricted to studies published within a ten-year timeframe. This was primarily due to the recency of the novel methodologies of interest, and also due to the broad search strategy found to be necessary in capturing all relevant studies. It remains possible that this could have excluded earlier notable works in the field. Lastly, the heterogeneity of methodologies and outcome measures across studies limits the comparability of findings and generalizability of conclusions. Future research in populations with language disorders should address the aforementioned gaps in the literature regarding paradigms that explicitly probe relatedness between items (e.g., associative judgement tasks), the use of relatedness-based tasks in individuals with brain tumours, and the continued development of novel computational and automated techniques. Conclusion This systematic review sought to provide a comprehensive synthesis of relatedness-based tasks in populations with language disorders, shedding light on commonly used paradigms and analytical methods over the last decade. Relatedness-based tasks hold promise as valuable tools for assessing and understanding lexico-semantic deficits in clinical populations.","completion":"Thank you for sharing the detailed article on lexico-semantic processing and the use of relatedness-based tasks in assessing language disorders.

It would be nice to make it a tiny bit shorter. Background: Understanding lexico-semantic processing is crucial for dissecting the complexities of language and its disorders. Relatedness-based tasks, or those which investigate the degree of relatedness in meaning between either task items or items produced by participants, offer the opportunity to make use of novel computational and analytical techniques from cognitive network science. Recognizing the need to deepen our understanding of lexico-semantic deficits through diverse experimental and analytical approaches, this systematic review aims to survey the landscape of relatedness-based tasks in studies of individuals with language disorders. Methods: A comprehensive search of four electronic databases was conducted to identify original experimental studies employing relatedness-based tasks in populations with language disorders or other neurological conditions, covering publications from the last decade (October 2013 to September 2023). A total of 34 eligible studies were identified, and were analyzed for the types of tasks used, the populations being studied, the selection of task items, and the analytical approaches employed. Results: The predominant use of category fluency tasks emerged across studies, with a notable absence of associative judgment tasks or other comparable paradigms. Commonly discussed populations included individuals with post-stroke aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and schizophrenia, among others. Analytical methods varied significantly, ranging from more traditional approaches of clustering and switches to more sophisticated (and novel?) computational techniques. Discussion: Despite the evident utility of category fluency tasks in research and clinical settings, the review underscores a critical need for the diversification of experimental paradigms to probe lexico-semantic processing in a more multifaceted manner. The findings advocate for a broadened approach in research methodologies by incorporating a wider array of relatedness-based tasks and innovative analytical techniques, particularly those already present in research on healthy participants.","completion":"Background: Unraveling lexico-semantic processing is key to understanding language and its disorders.

This is further underscored by a wide confidence interval (-2.781 to 3.405) and a low t-statistic (0.201). 3. **High Price Synchronicity**: The average return is 1.215, suggesting a slight positive momentum effect. However, the p-value of 0.439 again demonstrates that this finding is not statistically significant. The confidence interval (-1.895 to 4.325) and a t-statistic of 0.777 also suggest that the momentum effect is not reliable at this level. 4. **High Minus Low Synchronicity**: This measures the momentum return difference between high and low synchronicity levels, showing an average return of 3.311. Although this suggests a potential momentum strategy by focusing on stocks with different levels of price synchronicity, the p-value of 0.183 indicates that this difference is not statistically significant either, supported by a t-statistic of 1.343 and a wide confidence interval (-1.594 to 8.216). # Down Market: 1. **Low Price Synchronicity**: Similar to the up market scenario, the average momentum return is negative (-3.274) but with a non-significant p-value of 0.306. The confidence interval from -9.774 to 3.226 and a t-statistic of -1.051 suggest a high variability and lack of reliability in the momentum effect. 2. **Medium Price Synchronicity**: With an average return of -0.804 and a high p-value of 0.732, there's no significant momentum effect at medium price synchronicity levels during down markets. The confidence interval (-5.628 to 4.020) and a t-statistic of -0.348 reinforce this conclusion. 3. **High Price Synchronicity**: This is where a significant positive momentum effect is observed with an average return of 5.518 and a low p-value of 0.015, suggesting that high price synchronicity levels can contribute to a strong momentum effect in down markets. The confidence interval (1.189 to 9.847) and a t-statistic of 2.659 strongly support this finding. 4. **High Minus Low Synchronicity**: This shows a substantial average return difference of 8.792 between high and low price synchronicity levels. Despite a borderline p-value of 0.079, this suggests a potential momentum strategy favoring high synchronicity stock prices during down markets. The broad confidence interval (-1.124 to 18.708) and a t-statistic of 1.849, however, note a cautious interpretation due to the lack of strong statistical significance. In summary, these tables provide insights into how the momentum effect varies under different market conditions and levels of price synchronicity. Notably, the strongest and statistically significant momentum effect is observed at high price synchronicity levels during down markets, offering a potentially effective strategy for investors during such periods."},{"prompt":"the following table is the result of OSL regression for measuring the effect of investor sentiment on momentum return. explain it : ضریب خطای استاندارد آماره T pValue β_0 -3.814 27.136 -0.141 0.889 SENT 7.459 28.061 0.266 0.791 MarketState -0.009 0.050 -0.175 0.861 MarketState^2 0.000 0.000 -0.803 0.424","completion":"The provided table represents the outcome of an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression analysis investigating the impact of investor sentiment (SENT), market state, and the square of the market state (MarketState^2) on momentum returns. Here's a breakdown and interpretation of the results: # Variables: - **β_0 (Intercept):** Represents the expected value of the dependent variable (momentum return) when all independent variables are set to zero. Its coefficient is -3.814 with a standard error of 27.136. - **SENT (Investor Sentiment):** This is meant to capture the effect of overall investor sentiment on momentum returns. The coefficient is 7.459, suggesting that a one-unit increase in investor sentiment is associated with a 7.459 unit increase in momentum returns, holding all else constant. However, with a standard error of 28.061 and a t-statistic of 0.266, the relationship is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.791). - **MarketState:** Reflects the condition of the market at a given time, possibly coded as a numerical value representing up or down markets. The coefficient is -0.009, indicating that an upturn in market state is slightly associated with a decrease in momentum returns. Nonetheless, with a standard error of 0.050 and a t-statistic of -0.175, this effect is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.861). - **MarketState^2:** This term is likely included to examine if there's a nonlinear relationship between market state and momentum returns. The coefficient is virtually zero (0.000) with a negligible t-statistic of -0.803, indicating no significant quadratic relationship (p-value = 0.424). # Interpretation: Overall, the regression model aimed to assess how investor sentiment and market condition (both linearly and non-linearly) impact momentum returns. However, the coefficients for SENT, MarketState, and MarketState^2 are not statistically significant, as suggested by their high p-values (greater than the common alpha level of 0.05). These results imply that, based on this model: 1. **Investor Sentiment (SENT):** There's no statistically significant evidence to support the notion that investor sentiment has a meaningful impact on momentum returns within the scope of this data and model. 2. **Market State and its Square:** Similarly, there's no significant evidence indicating that the market state, whether considered linearly or quadratically, substantially affects momentum returns. The high standard errors relative to the coefficient sizes also indicate considerable uncertainty in the estimates of the effects of these variables on momentum returns. # Conclusion: According to this OLS regression analysis, there's no significant evidence that investor sentiment or the state of the market (linearly or nonlinearly) has a statistically significant effect on momentum returns, given the data and model used. This does not necessarily mean there is no relationship; it could indicate limitations in the model, the need for additional variables to capture the complex dynamics better, or simply that the effect of these variables is not captured within the dataset analyzed."},{"prompt":"what is SE?","completion":"\\"SE\\" stands for Standard Error. It's a statistical term used to describe the measure of the dispersion or variability of a sample statistic from the population parameter it estimates. In simpler terms, it quantifies how much a calculated statistic, such as the mean or regression coefficient from a sample, is expected to vary from the true population value. The formula for calculating the standard error of the mean (SEM), for instance, is: [ SE_{text{mean}} = frac{s}{sqrt{n}} ] Where: - (s) is the sample standard deviation (a measure of spread of the data). - (n) is the size of the sample. In the context of regression analysis, the standard error of a regression coefficient measures how precisely the model estimates the coefficient's value. A smaller standard error indicates that the sample estimate is likely to be closer to the actual population value. When reporting regression results, the standard error helps assess the reliability of the coefficients: smaller standard errors suggest the coefficient is measured with more precision, whereas larger standard errors indicate less precision. The standard error is crucial in constructing confidence intervals and conducting hypothesis tests. For example, to determine if a coefficient is statistically significantly different from zero, you would look at the ratio of the coefficient to its standard error (resulting in a t-statistic), which is then assessed against a critical value from the t-distribution based on the desired confidence level and the degrees of freedom associated with the error term."},{"prompt":"summarize this: در مجموع، این تحلیل نشان می‌دهد که اثربخشی استراتژی‌های مومنتوم در بازارهای سهام ممکن است به طور قابل‌توجهی با سطح همزمانی قیمت متفاوت باشد، و اثرات مومنتومی بارزتر در سطوح بالاتر همزمانی مشاهده می‌شود. علاوه بر این، مقایسه مستقیم که تفاوت قابل توجهی در بازده مومنتومی بین تنظیمات همزمانی بالا و پایین را برجسته می کند، بر تأثیر بالقوه همزمانی قیمت بر استراتژی های معاملاتی مومنتوم تأکید می کند و درنتیجه فرضیه اول پژوهش تایید می‌شود. در مجموع نتایج نشان می‌دهد که وجود ثبات بازده (به عنوان تخمین اثر تمایلاتی) نقش مهمی در مشاهده اثرات مومنتوم در سهام، به ویژه با تأکید بر اهمیت همزمانی قیمت دارد. در حالاتی که ثبات بازدهی وجود دارد، سهام با همزمانی قیمت بالا اثر مومنتومی مشخصی از خود نشان می‌دهند. در مقابل، هنگامی که ثبات بازده وجود ندارد، اثرات مومنتوم، صرف نظر از سطح همزمانی قیمت، به طور کلی ناچیز است. در نتیجه می‌توان گفت که فرضیه دوم پژوهش رد می‌شود. به طور کلی، در شرایط گسستگی اطلاعات پایین، اثر مومنتوم قابل توجهی در سطوح مختلف همزمانی و همچنین در مقایسه بین سطوح همزمانی بالا و پایین وجود ندارد. در مقابل، تحت گسستگی اطلاعات بالا، اثرات مومنتوم قابل توجهی مشاهده می شود، با اثرات منفی در سطوح همزمانی پایین تر و یک اثر مثبت در همزمانی بالا. علاوه بر این، تفاوت معنی‌داری در اثرات مومنتوم بین سطوح همزمانی بالا و پایین مشهود است، که نشان می‌دهد سطح گسستگی اطلاعات به طور قابل‌توجهی بر اثرات مومنتوم در محیط‌های همزمانی مختلف تأثیر می‌گذارد. بر این اساس می‌توان گفت که فرضیه سوم پژوهش نیز رد می‌شود. در مجموع، یافته‌ها حاکی از آن است که در محیط‌هایی با تأخیر اطلاعاتی بالا، تأثیر بارزتر و از نظر آماری معنی‌دار هم‌زمانی قیمت سهام بر استراتژی‌های مومنتوم، به ویژه در عملکرد سهام با همزمانی بالا مشهود است. برعکس، در محیط‌های با تأخیر اطلاعات کم، اثر مومنتومی ضعیف‌تر بوده و از نظر آماری معنی‌دار به نظر نمی‌رسد، که نشان می‌دهد جریان اطلاعات سریع‌تر ممکن است اثرات مومنتومی مشاهده‌شده در شرایط همزمانی بالا و تأخیر اطلاعات پایین را کاهش دهد. این امر بر تأثیر تأخیر اطلاعات و همزمانی قیمت سهام بر موفقیت استراتژی‌های معاملاتی مومنتومی تأکید می‌کند و به سوگیری‌های شناختی اساسی اشاره می‌کند که ممکن است بر رفتار سرمایه‌گذار در شرایط مختلف بازار تأثیر بگذارد. به طور کلی، نتایج نشان می‌دهد که هم برای شرکت‌های بزرگ و هم برای شرکت‌های کوچک، اثر مومنتومی در شرکت‌های با همزمانی قیمت بالا در مقایسه با پایین بارزتر و قابل توجه‌تر است. شرکت‌های کوچک تفاوت اثر مومنتومی کمی قوی‌تر بین سطوح همزمانی بالا و پایین نشان می‌دهند. به طور خلاصه، این نتایج بینش هایی را در مورد چگونگی تغییر اثر مومنتوم تحت شرایط مختلف بازار و سطوح همزمانی قیمت ارائه می دهد. قوی‌ترین اثر مومنتوم معنی‌دار در سطوح همزمانی قیمت بالا در طول بازارهای نزولی مشاهده می‌شود که یک استراتژی بالقوه مؤثر برای سرمایه‌گذاران در چنین دوره‌هایی ارائه می‌دهد. با توجه به این تحلیل رگرسیون OLS، با توجه به داده ها و مدل استفاده شده، شواهد قابل توجهی مبنی بر اینکه احساسات سرمایه گذار تأثیر آماری معنی‌داری بر بازده مومنتومی داشته باشد، وجود ندارد.","completion":"Overall, the analysis demonstrates that the effectiveness of momentum strategies in stock markets may significantly vary with the level of price synchronicity, with more pronounced momentum effects observed at higher levels of synchronicity. Moreover, a direct comparison highlighting a significant difference in momentum returns between high and low synchronicity settings emphasizes the potential impact of price synchronicity on momentum trading strategies, thereby confirming the initial hypothesis of the research. The results further indicate that the presence of return stability (as an estimate of the effect of tendencies) plays a crucial role in observing momentum effects in stocks, particularly underscoring the importance of price synchronicity. Where there is return stability, stocks with high price synchronicity demonstrate a clear momentum effect. In contrast, when return stability is absent, momentum effects, regardless of the level of price synchronicity, are generally negligible. Consequently, it can be said that the second hypothesis of the research is rejected. Overall, in environments of low information asymmetry, there is no significant momentum effect across different levels of synchronicity and also in comparison between high and low synchronicity levels. Conversely, under high information asymmetry, significant momentum effects are observed, with negative effects at lower levels of synchronicity and a positive effect at high synchronicity. Additionally, a significant difference in momentum effects between high and low synchronicity levels is evident, indicating that the level of information asymmetry significantly influences the momentum effects in different synchronicity environments. Based on this, it can be said that the third research hypothesis is also rejected. In sum, the findings suggest that in environments with high informational delays, a more pronounced and statistically significant impact of stock price synchronicity on momentum strategies, especially in the performance of stocks with high synchronicity, is observed. Conversely, in environments with low informational delays, the momentum effect is weaker and does not appear to be statistically significant, suggesting that faster information flow may decrease the observed momentum effects in conditions of high synchronicity and low information delays. This underscores the impact of information delays and stock price synchronicity on the success of momentum trading strategies and points to fundamental cognitive biases that may affect investor behavior under different market conditions. In general, the results show that for both large and small companies, the momentum effect is more prominent and significant in companies with high price synchronicity compared to those with low synchronicity. Small companies demonstrate a slightly stronger momentum effect difference between high and low synchronicity levels. In summary, these results provide insights into how the momentum effect changes under different market conditions and levels of price synchronicity. The strongest statistically significant momentum effect is observed at high price synchronicity levels during down markets, offering a potentially effective strategy for investors in such periods. According to this OLS regression analysis, there's no significant evidence to suggest investor sentiment has a statistically meaningful impact on momentum returns, given the data and model used."},{"prompt":"provide a full discussion based on these results","completion":"The analysis and results discussed offer a nuanced view on the dynamics of momentum investing strategies across different market conditions, particularly focusing on the interplay between investor sentiment, market states, price synchronicity, and information asymmetry. The core conclusions drawn from the research suggest several valuable insights for both theoretical understanding and practical application in financial markets. Here’s a comprehensive discussion based on the provided results: # Impact of Price Synchronicity on Momentum Strategies The research highlights a significant variability in the effectiveness of momentum strategies depending on the level of price synchronicity among stocks. Specifically, stocks exhibiting high levels of price synchronicity demonstrate stronger momentum effects, especially in down markets. This finding suggests that during periods of market downturns, stocks that move in greater unison might provide more reliable signals for momentum strategies, potentially due to more pervasive investor sentiment or market-wide factors influencing stock movements. Furthermore, the distinctive difference in momentum returns between high and low synchronicity settings underscores the crucial role that synchronization of stock prices plays in momentum trading strategies. This could be interpreted as evidence that in environments where stocks move more collectively, momentum signals are stronger and more exploitable by traders. # Influence of Information Asymmetry A particularly compelling aspect of the research is the examination of how different levels of information asymmetry affect momentum returns. In conditions of high information asymmetry, the research finds notable momentum effects, with an interesting twist: negative effects at lower synchronicity levels and positive effects at higher synchronicity levels. This suggests that in markets where information is unevenly distributed, the predictability and reliability of momentum strategies could significantly depend on how closely stock prices move together. This finding could have implications for how investors manage and diversify their portfolios under varying market conditions. For instance, in highly asymmetrical information environments, investors might benefit from focusing on stocks that exhibit higher synchronicity, as these stocks might offer clearer momentum signals. # Role of Investor Sentiment One of the more intriguing outcomes of the analysis is the apparent lack of significant statistical impact of investor sentiment on momentum returns, as per the OLS regression results. This could suggest that while investor sentiment undoubtedly influences market movements and stock prices, its direct impact on the success of momentum strategies might be less substantial than previously assumed. Alternatively, it might indicate the need for more nuanced models to capture the complex ways sentiment interacts with market dynamics. This result invites further exploration into the mechanisms through which investor sentiment affects stock markets and whether its influence on momentum strategies is more indirect or moderated by other factors such as market volatility, trading volume, or macroeconomic indicators. # Theoretical and Practical Implications From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the body of knowledge on market efficiency and behavioral finance, challenging and refining our understanding of how information, sentiment, and market dynamics interact to influence stock prices and trading strategies. Practically, the research provides actionable insights for investors, suggesting that paying attention to the synchronicity of stock prices and the level of information asymmetry in the market could enhance the effectiveness of momentum strategies. It also highlights the potential need for investors to adapt their strategies based on prevailing market conditions, particularly in terms of information flow and aggregate market behavior. # Future Directions The results point towards several areas for further research, including exploring more deeply the causative factors behind the observed phenomena and refining models to better capture the complex interplay of investor sentiment, market conditions, and stock price movements. Additionally, investigating how these dynamics manifest across different market sectors or geographies could yield further valuable insights. In conclusion, the study enriches our understanding of momentum investing, emphasizing the need for investors to consider the broader market context, including price synchronicity and information asymmetry, in their strategies. While investor sentiment may not directly dictate momentum returns, the overarching market environment plays a crucial role in shaping investment opportunities and risks."},{"prompt":"provide 4 main future research directions","completion":"The exploration into the dynamics of momentum investing strategies, particularly in relation to price synchronicity, information asymmetry, and investor sentiment, opens numerous avenues for future research. Four main directions that could be particularly fruitful for expanding our understanding are: # 1. Investigating the Role of Macro-economic Factors Future studies could delve deeper into how broader macro-economic factors (like interest rates, inflation, GDP growth rates, etc.) interact with investor sentiment and price synchronicity to influence momentum strategies. Understanding these relationships could provide a more comprehensive view of the conditions under which momentum investing is most effective, potentially leading to the development of models that incorporate economic indicators to predict momentum returns more accurately. # 2. Sector-specific Momentum Analysis Another promising direction is conducting sector-specific analyses to determine if certain industries or sectors exhibit stronger momentum effects due to higher price synchronicity or different levels of information asymmetry. For instance, technology stocks might behave differently from utility stocks in terms of price movements and investor reactions to news. Understanding these sector-specific dynamics could aid investors in refining their momentum strategies to capitalize on industry-specific trends. # 3. Comparative Studies Across Different Markets and Geographies Cross-market and cross-geographical studies could reveal valuable insights into how momentum investing strategies perform under various regulatory environments, market development levels, and investor behavior norms. Investigating momentum effects in emerging versus developed markets, for instance, could highlight the impact of market maturity on the efficacy of these strategies and offer a global perspective on momentum trading's universality or variability. # 4. Advanced Modeling Techniques to Account for Investor Psychology Given the somewhat surprising finding regarding the limited direct impact of investor sentiment on momentum returns, future research could benefit from employing advanced modeling techniques, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to better capture the nuanced ways investor psychology influences the market. These models could incorporate a broader array of data, including social media sentiment analysis, news sentiment analysis, and behavioral economic factors, to predict momentum returns with greater accuracy. Each of these future research directions offers a pathway to uncovering deeper insights into the complex interplay of market dynamics that drive momentum investing. By addressing these areas, researchers can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of financial markets, thereby aiding investors in developing more sophisticated and effective investment strategies."},{"prompt":"1_Diabetic keoacidosis must be such as uremia, gastroenteritis with metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, aspirin poisoning, hypoglycemic coma, encephalitis and encephalopathy.

Ketoacidosis: the immediate goal of treatment is expansion of intravascular compartment by correction of water and electrolytes depletion. The total fluid requirement = deficit + maintenance. The initial phase which is regarded as life saving measure is by giving normal saline 20_30ml/kg/hour and shift to 1/2 normal saline 0.45% NACL for the subsequent replacement therapy. Because of the hyperosmolarity of the blood the quick and rapid replacement therapy leads to shift of water into the intracellular compartment which has been implicated in development of cerebral edema which is one of the major complication of diabetic therapy in children. For the same reason 1/2 normal saline must be given after the first hour of hydration, also administration of 5% of glucose in 0.2 normal saline must be initiated when the blood sugar approaching 250mg/dl in order to limit rapid decline in serum osmolarity and reduce the risk of cerebral edema. KCL therapy: during the second hour of hydration KCL should be given provided the patient has good urine output, the early administration of KCL is due to shift of K+ from extracellular to intracellular compartment because of correction of acidosis and use of insulin. 10_20 meq/500cc of 1/2 normal saline should be given during the second hour of hydration.

Here is an organized explanation of the treatment strategy for DKA: **Understanding Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):** DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that arises due to a severe shortage of insulin in the body, leading to hyperglycemia (blood sugar > 300mg/dl), ketonemia, acidosis (pH < 7.3), decreased serum bicarbonate (NAHCO3 < 15meq/l), glucosuria, and ketonuria. Precipitating factors can include trauma, infection, vomiting, and psychological disturbances. **Treatment Phases of DKA:** The treatment is divided into three phases to ensure complete recovery and prevent complications: 1. **Ketoacidosis Phase:** - **Goal:** Expand the intravascular compartment by correcting water and electrolyte depletion. - **Fluid Therapy:** Initially, normal saline (20-30ml/kg/hour) is administered to correct dehydration. This is followed by 0.45% NaCl (half normal saline) for subsequent replacement. The rationale is to prevent rapid shifts of water into the intracellular space, which can lead to cerebral edema, especially in children. - **Transition:** When blood glucose levels approach 250mg/dl, a solution containing 5% glucose in 0.2 normal saline is introduced to prevent a rapid decline in serum osmolarity and reduce the risk of cerebral edema. 2. **Post-Ketotic or Transitional Period:** - **Potassium (KCL) Therapy:** Begins during the second hour of hydration, provided the patient has adequate urine output. Early KCL administration corrects the shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment, a shift initiated by acidosis correction and insulin use. Potassium dosage is 10-20 meq/500cc of half normal saline during the second hour. Continual monitoring of ECG and serum potassium levels is necessary to adjust therapy as needed. - **Phosphate Replacement:** Begins after the third hour of fluid therapy to counteract the decrease in acidosis, tune the 2,3-DPG concentration for oxygen utilization, and overcome any resistance to insulin action due to hypophosphatemia. 3. **Continuing Phase:** - **Alkali Therapy:** Only considered if pH is below 7.15, indicating severe acidosis unresponsive to standard fluid and electrolyte management. Depending on the severity, different quantities of bicarbonate are administered under careful monitoring to avoid complications such as hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypocalcaemia, and paradoxical cerebral acidosis. **Special Considerations:** - **Cerebral Edema:** Rapid changes in osmolarity should be carefully managed to avoid this complication, notably in pediatric patients. - **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs, ECG, serum electrolytes, and pH is essential throughout treatment to adjust therapy promptly. - **ICU Care:** Severe cases, especially those with pH < 7, require intensive care unit management due to the risk of systemic complications. In summary, the management of DKA involves meticulously staged fluid and electrolyte replacement, careful monitoring, and adjustment of therapy based on evolving clinical parameters to prevent complications."},{"prompt":"alkaline therapy for pediatric in dka explain precisely with dosages step by step","completion":"Alkaline therapy, specifically bicarbonate therapy, in pediatric DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) is a contentious and meticulously administered treatment due to potential risks and complications. It is generally reserved for cases with severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) when the acidosis could lead to cardiovascular instability or significantly delay recovery. Clinical guidelines vary, and the decision to use bicarbonate therapy should always be individualized, considering the patient's acid-base status, level of consciousness, and hemodynamic stability. Here's a simplified, stepwise approach to alkaline therapy in pediatric DKA, reflecting conservative use: # Step 1: Evaluation and Indication - **pH Measurement:** Determine if pH is less than 7.1. Alkaline therapy is usually considered at this critical level due to risks of bicarbonate therapy, such as hypokalemia and cerebral edema. - **Clinical Assessment:** Assess for signs of severe acidosis that may warrant bicarbonate therapy, including altered mental status or shock. # Step 2: Preparation and Dosage Calculation - If pH is < 7.1 and after careful consideration, prepare the bicarbonate solution. The general guideline for bicarbonate administration in children is to correct half of the calculated bicarbonate deficit over the first 4-6 hours. - **Bicarbonate Deficit Calculation:** Calculate the deficit using the formula: [ text{Bicarbonate Deficit (meq)} = 0.3 times text{Weight (kg)} times (15 - text{Actual Serum }[HCO_3^-] text{ in meq/L}) ] - Aim to correct half of this deficit, as correcting it all at once could lead to overshoot alkalosis. # Step 3: Administration - **Dilution:** Dilute the calculated dose of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) in 5% dextrose water to achieve a less hypertonic solution, reducing the risk of osmolar shifts. Typically, 1 meq/mL bicarbonate is diluted to prevent rapid osmolar changes. - **Infusion Rate:** Administer the diluted bicarbonate over 4-6 hours, closely monitoring the patient's acid-base status, blood glucose levels, and electrolytes, especially potassium. - *Important:* Concurrently address potassium levels to prevent hypokalemia, a common side effect of bicarbonate administration. # Step 4: Monitoring and Adjustments - **Serial pH Estimations:** Repeat blood gas analyses every 2 hours to monitor the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy and prevent overcorrection. - **Electrolyte Reassessment:** Frequently monitor serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and calcium, to identify and correct any disturbances promptly. Adjust bicarbonate administration based on ongoing assessments. - **Clinical Observation:** Monitor for signs of fluid overload, cerebral edema, and changes in mental status. # Step 5: Ongoing Assessment - After stabilizing the patient’s acid-base balance, continue managing DKA according to standard protocols for fluid, electrolyte management, and insulin therapy. - Continuously reassess the need for further bicarbonate therapy based on clinical status and laboratory values. # Special Considerations: - **Cerebral Edema:** Vigilance for symptoms of cerebral edema is critical, especially in children receiving bicarbonate therapy. - **Hypokalemia:** Aggressive treatment of hypokalemia should accompany bicarbonate administration due to the shift of potassium into cells. Remember, the use of bicarbonate in pediatric DKA is controversial and should be approached with caution, ensuring constant monitoring and readiness to address complications. Decision-making should involve multidisciplinary consultation and be guided by the most current clinical guidelines and evidence."},{"prompt":"Nutritional management: Actually there are no special nutritional requirements for diabetic child other than theses for optimal growth and development.

A well-structured nutritional plan centers around the distribution of macronutrients—carbohydrates, fats, and proteins—in a way that helps maintain stable blood glucose levels while meeting the nutritional requirements of a growing child. Here's a detailed view of the nutritional management strategy for a diabetic child: # Total Daily Caloric Requirements - **Macronutrient Distribution**: - **Carbohydrates:** About 55% of daily calories. Carbohydrates have the most immediate effect on blood glucose levels. The focus should be on complex carbohydrates (e.g., whole grains, vegetables, and fruits) that are digested more slowly, resulting in a slower rise in blood glucose. - **Fats:** Approximately 30% of daily calories. Fat consumption is crucial for brain development and energy but must be balanced to avoid contributing to cardiovascular disease risk. Prioritizing polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats over saturated fats is recommended. - **Proteins:** About 15% of daily calories. Protein is essential for the growth and repair of body tissues. - **Avoidance of Simple Sugars**: Foods high in simple sugars (sucrose, high fructose corn syrup) should be minimized as they can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels. # Meal Distribution - Dividing the total caloric intake helps in maintaining energy levels and stabilizing blood glucose throughout the day: - **Breakfast:** 20% of daily calories - **Lunch:** 20% of daily calories - **Dinner:** 30% of daily calories - **Snacks:** Three snacks (mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and evening), each contributing to around 10% of the daily caloric intake. # Examples and Practical Application **Carbohydrate Management** - For a child requiring 2000 calories per day, 55% from carbohydrates equates to 1100 calories, or approximately 275 grams of carbohydrates (since 1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 calories). - **Example**: Opt for whole-grain bread, brown rice, legumes, and starchy vegetables. Fruits can also be a good source, but portion control is important to prevent blood sugar spikes. **Fat Management** - With 30% of daily calories from fat in a 2000 calorie diet, this means 600 calories from fats, translating to about 67 grams of fat per day (since 1 gram of fat = 9 calories). - **Example**: Use olive oil for cooking, consume fatty fish like salmon for omega-3 fatty acids, and incorporate nuts and seeds as part of snacks or salads. **Protein Management** - Requiring 15% of daily calories from proteins, a 2000 calorie diet would include 300 calories from proteins, equaling 75 grams of protein (since 1 gram of protein = 4 calories). - **Example**: Lean chicken, turkey, legumes, tofu, and low-fat dairy products are excellent protein sources. **Meal Planning** - **Breakfast** (20%): Oatmeal cooked with milk, topped with a handful of almonds, and a side of sliced strawberries. - **Mid-morning Snack** (10%): Greek yogurt with a sprinkle of chia seeds. - **Lunch** (20%): A turkey and avocado whole-grain wrap with a side salad dressed in olive oil vinaigrette. - **Mid-afternoon Snack** (10%): Sliced apple with peanut butter. - **Dinner** (30%): Grilled salmon, quinoa, and steamed broccoli. - **Evening Snack** (10%): A small piece of whole-grain toast with cottage cheese. # Monitoring and Adjustments Maintaining frequent glucose monitoring is key to adjusting dietary needs and insulin therapy accurately. Collaboration with a dietitian specialized in diabetes management can provide tailored nutritional guidance and ongoing support to meet the child's evolving needs. Balancing the dietary aspects of diabetes management with normal childhood experiences, such as birthday parties and holidays, requires flexibility and sometimes insulin dose adjustments under medical guidance.

They have the expertise specifically in insurance products and can help find the best option based on your health needs and financial situation. 2. **\\"Radca prawny\\" or Legal Advisor/Solicitor**: A \\"radca prawny\\" or any legal advisor specialized in healthcare or insurance law in Poland might be able to provide legal advice especially if you have specific legal concerns about health insurance contracts, rights, and obligations under the Polish health care system. However, for the practical aspects of choosing and signing up for an insurance plan, their assistance might be more limited compared to that of an insurance broker. 3. **Accountant (Księgowy)**: An accountant, especially one with experience in dealing with expats or familiar with social security and health insurance matters, can be helpful in explaining the tax implications of your health insurance and ensuring any payments are properly accounted for. They can advise on the financial perspective but might not have detailed information on specific insurance plans or healthcare services covered. 4. **Local Office of NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia)**: For the most direct information and assistance, contacting a local NFZ office might be the best approach. The staff there can guide you through the available plans, the registration process, and answer specific questions regarding coverage. This way, you get information straight from the source. 5. **Expatriate Assistance Organizations**: Various organizations and groups exist that help expatriates navigate living in Poland, including dealing with health insurance. They can offer practical advice, share experiences, and sometimes provide contacts of professionals who can assist further. Choosing the right professional depends on what you need: legal advice, understanding of financial implications, or detailed guidance on picking the right insurance product. For most individuals looking to understand and purchase an NFZ plan, starting with a visit or call to the local NFZ office and possibly consulting with an insurance broker should provide comprehensive guidance."},{"prompt":"What's the name of an insurance broker in Polish? And who will tell me what should I fill in which fields of required forms?","completion":"An insurance broker in Polish is referred to as \\"broker ubezpieczeniowy\\" or sometimes \\"agent ubezpieczeniowy,\\" although there's a slight distinction between the terminologies. A \\"broker ubezpieczeniowy\\" operates as an independent agent who can offer insurance products from different companies, providing more unbiased advice compared to an \\"agent ubezpieczeniowy,\\" who typically represents and sells products from a specific insurance company. When it comes to assistance with filling out specific forms, including knowing what information goes into which fields, the following options are available: 1. **Broker Ubezpieczeniowy (Insurance Broker)**: They can provide detailed advice on the insurance application process, including what specific details need to be filled into forms. Since brokers work with various insurance products and companies, they are knowledgeable about application procedures and can guide you through it. 2. **Pracownik NFZ (NFZ Staff)**: If you are applying for a plan directly through the Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia (NFZ), staff members at the local NFZ office can assist you with the forms. They can tell you exactly what information is required for each field, how to properly fill out the forms, and what additional documents might be needed for your application. 3. **Biuro Obsługi Klienta (Customer Service Office)** of the insurance company you are considering can also assist. If your interest in NFZ insurance leads you to a particular health insurance option administered by a specific company working with NFZ, their customer service representatives can guide you through their application processes. 4. **Radca prawny or Doradca podatkowy (Legal Advisor or Tax Advisor)**: For more general assistance, including the implications of insurance fees and documentation, legal or tax advisors can offer guidance. They won't typically fill out forms for you but can explain the importance and legal/tax repercussions of the information requested. 5. **Accountants (Księgowi)** particularly those with experience in expatriate affairs or personal finance in Poland might assist you in understanding the financial aspects of the forms, such as any tax-related implications or benefits associated with health insurance payments. For the most direct and tailored assistance, starting with the entity you are applying through (be it NFZ directly or through an insurance product linked to NFZ) is usually the best first step.

Чем бесполое размножение отличается от полового? 2. Какое деление лежит в основе бесполого размножения? 3. Какое биологическое значение бесполого размножения?","completion":"1. Бесполое размножение отличается от полового следующим: - В бесполом размножении участвует только один родительский организм, в результате чего потомство генетически идентично родителю. В половом размножении участвуют два родителя, каждый из которых дает потомству свой набор генов, что приводит к генетическому разнообразию. - Бесполое размножение обычно происходит посредством процессов, таких как фрагментация, деление, спорообразование и т.д., в то время как половое размножение включает в себя образование гамет, их слияние (оплодотворение) и образование зиготы. - Половое размножение способствует генетическому разнообразию, в то время как бесполое — обеспечивает быстрое увеличение численности популяции. 2. В основе бесполого размножения лежит митотическое деление. В процессе митоза происходит точное копирование хромосом и равное их распределение между дочерними клетками, что обеспечивает генетическую идентичность потомства и родительского организма. 3. Биологическое значение бесполого размножения: - Эффективное и быстрое увеличение размера популяции, что особенно важно в благоприятных условиях среды. - Заселение и колонизация новых территорий одним организмом, который может сам себя размножать. - Восстановление поврежденных частей тела или регенерация целых организмов из фрагментов, что наблюдается у многих растений и некоторых животных. - Обеспечение выживания в условиях нестабильной или изменяющейся среды за счет возможности быстрого увеличения численности особей. - Зачастую бесполое размножение позволяет организмам поддерживать генетическую стабильность и избегать накопления вредных мутаций, что может быть важно в условиях постоянно благоприятной среды."},{"prompt":"You are going to take an exam for a biology professor and answer his questions.

Женские гонады у животных называются яичниками (овариями), а мужские – семенниками (тестикулами). 2. Процесс слияния гамет называется оплодотворением. 3. Биологическое значение полового размножения заключается в следующем: - Половое размножение способствует генетическому разнообразию, что увеличивает шансы популяции на выживание в изменяющихся условиях среды. Благодаря рекомбинации генетического материала между двумя родителями создаются новые сочетания генов, которые могут оказаться более удачными для адаптации к среде. - Генетическое разнообразие также играет важную роль в процессе естественного отбора и эволюционном процессе, поскольку наличие различных вариантов генов и признаков облегчает адаптацию к изменяющимся условиям или новым вызовам. Задание 3: Этапы эмбрионального периода развития зародыша у хордовых животных включают: - Зигота: первоначальная клетка, образовавшаяся в результате слияния мужских и женских гамет. - Морула: ранний этап развития эмбриона, представляющий собой скопление клеток, образовавшихся в результате дробления зиготы. - Бластула: стадия развития, на которой формируется полость внутри клеточного образования, известная как бластоцель. - Гаструла: этап, в ходе которого происходит формирование трех слоев зародышевых клеток (эктодерма, мезодерма, и энтодерма) и первичного рота. - Нейрула: стадия, на которой начинается закладывание и развитие нервной системы, формируется нервная трубка.

However, the process of including a vector in your FlatBuffers schema and subsequently serializing it for transmission is straightforward. Let's walk through an example to illustrate how you might work with vectors in FlatBuffers, including defining a schema with vectors, generating the code for your chosen programming language, and then serializing and sending data that includes a vector. # Step 1: Define Your Schema First, you need to define your FlatBuffers schema (\`.fbs\` file). This definition includes the vector you want to work with. \`\`\`fbs // Example schema with a vector namespace Example; table MyTable { myVector:[int]; // Define a vector of integers } root_type MyTable; \`\`\` # Step 2: Generate Language-Specific Code Use the \`flatc\` compiler to generate code in your target language. \`\`\`sh flatc --python -o output_directory example.fbs \`\`\` Replace \`--python\` with the flag corresponding to your desired programming language, and adjust the paths as needed. # Step 3: Build and Serialize Your Data With the generated code, you can now construct and serialize an instance of \`MyTable\`, including a vector of integers. Here's how you might do it in Python, assuming you've generated Python bindings: \`\`\`python import flatbuffers from Example import MyTable # Initialize a FlatBuffer builder builder = flatbuffers.Builder(1024) # Create the vector. Start with the end of the vector so FlatBuffers knows how many elements there are. MyTable.MyTableStartMyVectorVector(builder, 3) builder.PrependInt32(3) builder.PrependInt32(2) builder.PrependInt32(1) vec = builder.EndVector(3) # Use the vector in creating the table MyTable.MyTableStart(builder) MyTable.MyTableAddMyVector(builder, vec) my_table = MyTable.MyTableEnd(builder) builder.Finish(my_table) # Now the builder's output contains the serialized data buf = builder.Output() # You can then send \`buf\` over the network or save it to a file \`\`\` # Step 4: Sending the Serialized Data The \`buf\` variable contains your serialized FlatBuffers data, including the vector. How you send this data depends on your application. Typically, you might: - Write it to a file - Send it over a socket - Include it as part of an HTTP request body Since you asked about sending vectors directly, remember, in FlatBuffers, data transmission is centered around the concept of sending entire FlatBuffer-encoded objects—your vector is part of such an object. # Conclusion This process outlines defining a vector in a FlatBuffers schema, generating code, serializing an object that includes a vector, and potentially sending it over the network. The specifics of how you handle the transmission will depend on the details of your application's networking code."},{"prompt":"{MOUNT WILDWOOD} Natsuki: \\"Hey, Smogmella?

Пример команды для просмотра всех активных TCP соединений: \`\`\` ss -t -a \`\`\` Чтобы посмотреть все активные UDP соединения, используйте: \`\`\` ss -u -a \`\`\` 2. **netstat** - это традиционная утилита для отображения активных подключений, таблиц маршрутизации, статистики интерфейсов и прочей сетевой информации. Она может быть не установлена в некоторых современных дистрибутивах по умолчанию, так как пакет \`net-tools\`, к которому она принадлежит, постепенно уступает место \`iproute2\`. Пример команды для просмотра всех активных соединений: \`\`\` netstat -tunapl \`\`\` 3. **lsof** - это универсальная утилита для вывода списков открытых файлов и сокетов. Хотя она и не ограничивается только сетевой информацией, \`lsof\` может быть использована для просмотра активных соединений благодаря её возможности выводить информацию об открытых сетевых сокетах. Пример команды для просмотра всех активных сетевых соединений: \`\`\` lsof -i \`\`\` Чтобы сузить вывод до TCP соединений, используйте: \`\`\` lsof -i tcp \`\`\` Выбор конкретного инструмента зависит от ваших специфических потребностей и предпочтений. \`ss\` обеспечивает быстрый и гибкий способ просмотра статистики сокетов и активных подключений. \`netstat\` предоставляет более традиционный интерфейс и широко используется во множестве руководств и инструкций. \`lsof\` предлагает мощные возможности для анализа открытых файлов и сокетов, но может потребовать больше времени для изучения и освоения."},{"prompt":"Сенсибилированные лимфоциты, это, скажи кратко","completion":"Сенсибилизированные лимфоциты - это лимфоциты, которые уже встречались с определенным антигеном и \\"запомнили\\" его.

The White Paper, titled \\"Protecting Copyright in the Digital Age\\", aims to crack down on the unauthorized use of copyrighted material on the internet. If implemented, it would require platforms like YouTube to steer clear of copyrighted content or face severe penalties. Proponents of the White Paper argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of creators and ensure fair compensation for their work. They claim that rampant copyright infringement on the internet has led to a loss of revenue for artists and creators, and that stricter regulations are needed to combat this problem. However, critics of the White Paper have raised concerns about the potential for abuse and censorship. They argue that the broad language of the White Paper could be used to stifle free speech and creativity on the internet, as platforms may err on the side of caution and remove any content that could potentially infringe on copyright. Many content creators on platforms like YouTube have expressed their fears about the implications of the White Paper. They worry that their videos could be unfairly taken down or demonetized, even if they are using copyrighted material in a transformative or fair use manner. The passing of this White Paper has ignited a fierce debate about the balance between copyright protection and freedom of expression on the internet. As the White Paper moves closer to becoming law, it remains to be seen how it will be enforced and what impact it will have on the online landscape."},{"prompt":"Write the paper, and it says content technologies should be in place","completion":"Title: Implementing Content Technologies to Safeguard Copyright in the Digital Age In recent years, the internet has become a vast and diverse platform for sharing and disseminating content. While this democratization of information has brought numerous benefits, it has also posed challenges for copyright protection. The unauthorized use of copyrighted material has become rampant, leading to significant financial losses for creators and rights holders. In response to this problem, there has been a call for stricter regulations and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard copyright in the digital age. One effective solution that has been proposed is the implementation of content technologies that can automatically detect and prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted material on online platforms. Content technologies, such as content recognition software, have the capability to compare uploaded content against a database of copyrighted material and flag any potential infringements. Platforms like YouTube have already implemented similar technologies to identify and address copyright violations, albeit with varying degrees of success. By leveraging content technologies, platforms can better protect the rights of creators and rights holders while also promoting a fair and competitive online environment. These technologies can help to identify and remove infringing content promptly, reducing the need for manual review and intervention. Furthermore, content technologies can also provide valuable insights and data to rights holders, enabling them to better track and monitor the use of their content online. This can help creators and rights holders to identify trends, measure the impact of their content, and take appropriate action to protect their intellectual property. While the implementation of content technologies is not without its challenges and limitations, it represents a proactive and innovative approach to copyright protection in the digital age. By investing in and utilizing these technologies, online platforms can create a safer and more sustainable ecosystem for creators, rights holders, and users alike. In conclusion, the implementation of content technologies is crucial in safeguarding copyright in the digital age. By leveraging these tools effectively, platforms can strike a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and fostering a vibrant and diverse online environment. As technology continues to evolve, it is imperative that we adapt and embrace these advancements to ensure the continued vitality and creativity of the digital landscape."},{"prompt":"{MOUNT WILDWOOD} Natsuki: \\"Hey, Smogmella?

How to fix it ?","completion":"When using \`react-native-reanimated-carousel\` (or similar carousels) with dot pagination in React Native, and you experience a delay in the pagination updating relative to the swipe/slide of the carousel, it often relates to how and when the carousel's page index state is updated. The delay may be subtle but can impact the feel of responsiveness for the user. Since you've implemented pagination essentially as a set of static dots updated based on the \`currentIndex\` from the \`onSnapToItem\` callback, depending on how \`react-native-reanimated-carousel\` manages its animations and state updates, this could introduce the observed lag. A few strategies might help mitigate this: # 1. Leverage Animation-Driven Pagination If you're already using \`react-native-reanimated\`, consider creating an animated pagination that relies directly on the animated scroll position rather than the \`onSnapToItem\` callback. This makes the pagination dots react in real-time to the scroll position, thus reducing perceived lag. Since your sample seems to try mixing both Animated and Reanimated, specifically ensure that your pagination visual changes are driven by the same animated values governing the carousel's scroll. This typically means using \`useAnimatedStyle\` and the animated scroll value (\`progressValue\` in your case) to directly manipulate the dot styles. # 2. Optimize \`onSnapToItem\` Ensure that the logic inside \`onSnapToItem\` is minimal to avoid any unnecessary computations that could delay state updates. However, from your code, this seems straightforward. The issue is likely more about how fast state updates propagate through to re-renders in React. # 3. Intermediate State with Reanimated Consider using animation values from \`react-native-reanimated\` directly to animate the opacity or scale of the dots in real-time. This means essentially skipping the React state for index tracking and directly mapping the scroll or swipe progress to the visual indicator changes. # 4. Performance Tuning Ensure that the components inside your carousel, including each individual slide and the pagination dots, are optimized for performance. This includes avoiding unnecessary re-renders (consider \`React.memo\` for functional components where appropriate) and simplifying the render tree as much as possible. # Example (Simplified) Below is a simplified adjustment focusing on animating dot opacity based on scroll position: \`\`\`jsx // Assuming 'progressValue.value' directly maps to scroll offset or similar // and reflects the current position between pages. <View style={styles.pagination}> {ChannelCoverImagesDictionary.map((_, index) => { // Animated pagination dot style based on scroll position const dotStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => { const isActive = Math.abs(progressValue.value - index) < 0.5; return { opacity: isActive ? 1 : 0.5, }; }); return <Animated.View key={index} style={[styles.dot, dotStyle]} />; })} </View> \`\`\` Be sure this maps to your actual scroll or index values, as the logic would depend on how your \`progressValue\` or equivalent scroll value correlates to the pagination index. # Conclusion Switching to an animation-driven approach for pagination update logic, rather than relying solely on discrete callbacks (like \`onSnapToItem\`) for state changes, can notably improve the responsiveness of UI elements like pagination dots in a carousel setup."},{"prompt":"Chi sei","completion":"Sono un modello di intelligenza artificiale creato da OpenAI, progettato per assistere e fornire informazioni o risposte alle tue domande su una vasta gamma di argomenti.

Ensuring inputs and targets are correctly fed to the model and loss function is crucial for effective learning. Given you are working with a custom dataset and training loop, clarity on dimensional correctness at each step is vital. 3. **Minimal Intervention Presumption:** - Presuming you want to keep your code alterations minimal and retain the existing structure as much as possible, the following suggestions and modifications are proposed with that in mind. Let's start with addressing the model training process, mainly focusing on the data handling parts and training loop adjustments: # **Adjusting Data Preparation** Your current dataset setup with \`QAJsonlDataset\` seems adequate. However, ensuring your data splits (training/validation) are appropriately randomized and used in combination with a DataLoader for efficient batch handling is crucial. This seems to be partly in place but let's clarify that: \`\`\`python from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, random_split # Assuming your Dataset is correctly loading and preparing the data # Let's define the Dataset and DataLoader properly for both training and validation # You've already defined this, but as a reminder: dataset = QAJsonlDataset(path_to_data, tokenizer_path) # Correctly splitting your dataset train_dataset, val_dataset = random_split(dataset, [train_size, val_size]) # Define DataLoaders for both sets train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True) val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=32) \`\`\` # **Adjusting Training Loop** Your training loop is mostly set up correctly. However, ensure that your \`targets\` are properly managed when calculating loss, especially considering the dimensional requirements of the PyTorch loss functions. Moreover, log and evaluate your process appropriately. You've included an evaluation function which appears correct in computing accuracy. Remember to ensure your loss computation and gradient updates are appropriately handled. It looks like you're doing this right in the \`train\` function, noting the use of \`F.cross_entropy\` which expects the \`outputs\` to have dimensions \`[batch_size*sequence_length, num_classes]\` and \`targets\` to be \`[batch_size*sequence_length]\` after being reshaped with \`.view(-1)\`. # **Final Model Initialization and Training Execution** Your model definition and initialization steps seem adequately set up. However, always verify the final layer's output sizes and the loss functions expecting inputs to ensure compatibility. It seems you've already aligned these given the application of \`.view(-1)\` operations. Lastly, always revisit the choice of hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs), optimizer, and scheduler settings based on initial training outcomes and adjust as necessary for best model performance. # **Conclusion** Given the constraints of adapting the provided code without significant restructuring, we've highlighted key areas for ensuring efficient training and data handling. Ensure your model inputs and outputs align with your task objectives and loss computation needs. Training procedure adjustments mainly focused on data preparation and iterating over epochs with appropriate logging and evaluation routines. This guidance is designed to be applied with a minimal need for changing your established code structure, focusing on ensuring successful training of your Transformer model on the specified datasets."},{"prompt":"paraphrase this: The second and third name has been removed.

Hello, my happiness is Cameron!!! Sorry, I can't answer faster. It was the last working days before my vacation, and I couldn't even check my email. I am very glad to receive your letter. You are the one with whom I want to share my thoughts, hopes and dreams. Thinking about you fills my heart with joy. You inspire me so much. You are responsible and very friendly. For me, a person's physical condition, age, height and weight are not the most important things! The most important thing for me is his inner qualities, loyalty, tenderness, and caring for a loved one. I feel that you and I have a spiritual connection and attraction. Now, during these lines, I am a little worried, I am shy, but I do not want to hide my attitude towards you... This is not a declaration of love, I just want to tell you that I am very pleased to talk to you, and I really want to meet you. You are a well-mannered, intelligent person. You have filled a huge void in my heart! I have important news for you today. Please, my dear, Cameron, read my important news. Today I called the embassy, which is located in Moscow. Now I know all the information I need to travel to your country. I need to provide a list of documents. There are a lot of documents, I counted 8 documents. Firstly, the embassy needs guarantees of my return to Russia. They ask me to provide documents on the ownership of the apartment. This fact is a guarantee for them of my return to Russia. As they told me, I have to personally visit the embassy in Moscow to begin the process of formalizing the papers. My vacation starts tomorrow, and I can start the official paperwork at any time. As I was told, I have to visit the embassy to leave my fingerprints to get a visa. I have to show a certificate of marital status, a certificate from work, medical insurance, a declaration of payment of all taxes, as well as a passport and photos. I will try to get all the documents tomorrow. I was told that I could get a visa for up to 3 months, and that was very good news. Cameron, the embassy replied that I do not need an invitation from you, as my visa will be \\"tourist\\". If there is a need for an invitation, I will tell you about it. I am also currently thinking about my placement in Moscow, because I will have to spend about 10-15 days there. I chose the option of renting a room in Moscow! This is not a hotel! I will choose a cheaper option when I arrive in Moscow. I will have to pay for the visa processing, as well as I will need to pay the consular fee and an additional fee for completing the questionnaires. I have the money to pay all the expenses. Today, after a phone conversation with a girl from the embassy, I thought a lot about our first meeting. We have a sincere relationship, and I am sure that our relationship will develop. I want to know that our feelings are mutual. the most important thing for me now is to get a visa in Moscow. I hope that you, like me, really want to meet us. I have a feeling of pleasure that has appeared since the first day we met. The feeling of loneliness has gone out of my life, and I am pleased to realize that there is a person in the world who thinks about me. My dear, you have no idea how much I want to meet you, I would like our meeting to be unforgettable. Imagine how I am in an airport terminal among a crowd of people, suddenly I hear my name, turn around and see you! I have not had a relationship with this man for more than 2.5 years, I could not find a person in Russia who is so close to me spiritually. Accordingly, I have not had any sexual relations for 2.5 years. I show my body, and I'm very shy, but I trust you, and I think my body is more attractive and interesting to you than looking at the nasty cold weather outside. I believe that there will be great passion between us and we will be able to have fun together. I promise that! I want it so badly! This meeting is a big step in our relationship. I listen to my heart, and my heart says that we will be happy together. Please share your thoughts with me!!! Our meeting is the best way to get to know each other better. I kiss you!!!

So we can use those features to plot a graph. So if we plot the y-intercept, which for this graph is going to be negative 6, and then we need a gradient of 3, And then we need a gradient of 3. And then we can draw in our line. A gradient of 3 means we're stepping one right and three up to get to the next coordinate, one right and three up to get to the coordinate after that, and so on. Let's think about this graph. We've got 2x plus 3y equals 12. How would you go about drawing that graph? Have a think. So Jun would like to rearrange it into the form y equals mx plus c, and then use the gradient and the y-incept. Alex isn't so sure. Alex says we only need two pairs of coordinates, so we could just find two coordinates that satisfy that relationship. Of course, both methods are going to work. You might want to pause the video and just have a think about what you would do. So let's have a look at rearranging. So if we subtract 2x from both sides, we've got 3y equals 12 minus 2x. Divide by 3, we get negative 2-thirds x plus 4. Now, we could absolutely use the y-intercept of 4 and a gradient of negative 2 thirds x to draw this line. However, you might think that negative two thirds x is a little bit of a difficult gradient to use. So let's think about what Alex's method entails. So Alex says we just need two coordinates that fit this rule. Well, if we've got something in the form ax plus by equals c, there's two coordinates that's quite easy to find. y equals c. There's two coordinates that's quite easy to find. Any two coordinates would work, but we're going to look at the x-intercept and the y-intercept. They're often the most efficient. Because the x-intercept is where y is 0, if we substitute y as 0 into our equation, we can find the x-intercept. So we've got 2x plus 3 lots of 0 equals 12. 3 lots of 0 is of course 0, so 2x is 12, and x is 6. So when y is 0, x is 6. If we do the y-intercept as well, remember that's when x is 0. So we substitute x equals 0 into our equation. 3y is 12 and y is 4. So when x is 0, y is 4. We've now got two coordinates that we could plot and then draw in our line. Let's have a look. The coordinates are reasonably far apart, so it's going to be quite accurate to draw in a line between the two. You might want to check that your gradient is constant all the way along that line. Time to have a check then. So three oak pupils plot in the line 2y plus 4x equals 4. They're going to do it in some different ways. So Jun wants to use the gradient and the y-intercept. He says the gradient is negative 4 and the y-incept is 0, 4. Can you spot what mistake he has made? Well done if you spotted that he has not made y the subject. It still says 2y equals. In order to find the gradient and the y-incept, we need this in the form y equals mx plus c. So if he divides every term by two, then he'll make y the subject, and then he'll be able to read off the gradient and the y-incept. Sam's going to do it a different way. Sam wants to use a table of values. Have a look at the purple box. What has Sam done first to make this easier? And then can you fill in the three missing values? Off you go. Let's see if we've got any of that mathematical language in here. So they have made y the subject. They've written it in the form y equals mx plus c. And that often makes it easier to use a table of values because you know how to find y given x. Well, then, if you've got the missing values as 8, 6 and negative 4. Remember, you can check that it's got a linear relationship to make sure you haven't made any mistakes. Finally, Alex is going to use the x and y intercepts. Complete their working to find the values for when x is 0 and y is 0, and then have a think about which of those three methods were your favourite. Off you go! So, when y is 0, you should get x as 1. And when x is 0, you get y as 2. Well, I think all three methods were nice in this case. The rearranging gave integer values, which was nice and easy to use. And the x and y intercepts both had integer coordinates, so they're going to be nice and easy to use. So whichever method is your favourite is absolutely fine. So now we've reviewed how to plot graphs, we can look at how we can use them to solve problems. To start with, we can use graphs to solve equations. So here's the graph of y equals 8x minus 10. Let's use it to solve 8x-10 equals 2. All we need to do is find a value for x, which makes this expression have a value of 2. So if we look for 2 on the y-axis, and often it's easier to draw in the line y equals 2. And then we can read off by looking down to the x-axis and finding the corresponding value. So the solution to 8x minus 10 equals 2 is when x equals 1.5. If you wanted to check, you could substitute 1.5 into the equation and see if it balances. So when a graph represents a scenario, we can actually interpret the coordinates in context. It's really important that you think about what it is you're actually working out, not just following a process. So this is a conversion graph. It converts degrees Celsius into degrees Fahrenheit. It has an equation of F equals 1.8 C plus 32. Notice we've labelled our x-axis temperature in degrees C and our y-axis temperature in degrees F. So what do you think about this one? What does the coordinate 032 mean in context? Can you write down or say out loud a sentence for what that coordinate is representing? Off you go. Maybe you said something like this. Zero degrees Celsius is the same as 32 degrees Fahrenheit. That is what that coordinate represents. So June has a friend who lives in America. She says that 60 degrees Fahrenheit is about 20 degrees Celsius. How can we use the graph to check the accuracy of this statement? How would you do this one? Okay, there's a couple of ways to do this one. What you could do is plot the coordinate 20, 60, which is what Jun says should be on our line. However, we can see clearly that it's not on the graph. So 20 degrees Celsius is not 60 degrees Fahrenheit. It might be reasonably close. Let's use another method to check how close. So if you actually look for 60 degrees Fahrenheit and then draw a vertical line down to your x-axis, you can see that it's a lot nearer to 15 degrees than it is to 20 degrees. There's actually quite a big difference, isn't there, between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. So Jun's friend probably should have said it's roughly 15 degrees C. And then we'd have a better understanding of what 60 degrees Fahrenheit is actually like. Time for you to have a go. I degrees C should be 50 degrees Fahrenheit. And 5 degrees Fahrenheit should be negative 15 degrees C. Just check the graph if you didn't get values close to those. Right, time to put those skills into practice. For our first question, I'd like you to use this graph to solve the following equations. Off you go and come back when you're ready for the next set. Well done. So this second set is in context. So Lucas volunteers at local playgroup. For his homework, he drew a distance time graph of a race that two children ran. You can see on the right hand side our distance time graph. I'd like you to answer these questions for the graph that Lucas has drawn. Make sure you're thinking about the context and writing your answers in full sentences where necessary. Off you go. Question three. So a plumber calculates the amount to charge a customer using this linear relationship. It includes a call-out fee and a price per hour. I'd like you to think about that context when you answer these four questions. Off you go, come back when you're ready for the answers. So for the first one, you should have x is 3, then x is 0, then x is negative 2.4. Make sure you're happy with reading off decimal values on a graph. And then dx is negative 3. So let's think about this context now then. So child 1 ran 4 metres in 2 seconds. If you you just wrote four you haven't answered the question properly so four meters for b should be three seconds and c i wonder if you noticed that child two started further ahead so the y intercept is saying that zero seconds, so before the race has started, the child is already two meters. So that probably represents a two meter head start in this context. 5.10 and 8.10. So 5.10 means that child one took five seconds to run 10 meters. And 8.10 says that child two took 8 seconds to run 10 metres. 10 metres is probably the length of the race. Now, you could have combined that with your previous answer and said that actually Child 2 didn't run 10 metres. They actually only ran 8 metres. But to get 10 metres away from where they should have started, it took them 8 seconds. And the last one, there's some different answers you could have come up with here. You might have said something like, they don't run at a steady pace. Normally you'd accelerate at the beginning and then slow down later on, whereas a straight line graph suggests you're at the same speed all the way through. For a plumber, 0.80 suggests that a job that takes zero hours costs £80. You might have said that this was a call out fee. For B, you should have £120. For C, 10 hours. And then the price per hour is actually the gradient of this line. If you think about every hour you add on, how much does the price go up? We can see from the line that if you add on two hours, the price goes up £20. So for every hour, it's £10. So £10 per hour. Well done. We're now going to have a go at reviewing our quadratic graphs. So we can use a table of values to plot quadratic graphs too. Let's have a look at y equals x squared. So if we square our x values, remembering that when we square a negative value, we get a positive value, and then we can plot our values on a graph. Of course, this is not a linear equation, so it does not form a linear graph. Therefore, we cannot draw a straight line. We can see that really clearly. y equals x squared is a quadratic equation. Its graph is called a parabola. And what we can do is draw a curve instead. Jacob has noticed that we've got a line of symmetry, and in this case it's the y-axis. Okay, let's have a go with some trickier quadratic equations. We're going to do y equals 2x squared minus 4x. But we do exactly the same thing. We just need to substitute the required values for x. I would suggest that you start with zero and then the positive values and then go back to the negative values. The positive values are generally easier. And then you can look at some patterns to make sure you get the right values for the negative x. If you're using a calculator, make sure that you're putting brackets around your substituted value. Right, we've done the first three. Sam says, have we done something wrong? The y-coordinate is zero again. What do you think? y-coordinate is zero again. What do you think? No, our working out is perfect. It's just that there is a line of symmetry somewhere on a parabola. Therefore, it is common for there to be repeated values in the table. It doesn't always happen, but it is usual with a quadratic graph to see repeated values in the table. Let's finish off our positive values. Let's have a think now. What do we expect x equals negative two and x equals negative one to produce? See if you use Jacob's idea about symmetry. OK, let's try it out. We should have 6 and 16. I wonder if that's what you predicted looking at those values. And you can see we have got a line of symmetry because the values are repeated either side of when x is 1. Alex is having a go at plotting this one. is 1. Alex is having a go at plotting this one. I think when x is negative 1, the y value will be 4 because parabolas have a line of symmetry. I'd like you to substitute into this equation to see if Alex is correct. Off you go. Right, whether you're doing this by hand or using a calculator, you need to make sure you put brackets around the value you're substituting. So we should have negative one all squared plus two lots of negative one plus one. Negative one squared is one, so we've got one, add negative two, add one, and that gives us zero. So Alex is incorrect. There is going to be a line of symmetry somewhere, but it's not always the y-axis. So there could be a line of symmetry somewhere else in the table, or there might not even be in the table of values. It might be somewhere else on the graph. So like with linear equations, we can solve quadratic equations using their graph. So let's do x squared plus 4x plus 1 equals 6. First, we can draw the graph. And then we want to know when this is equal to 6. So if you draw the line y equals 6, you'll see that we have two solutions. Often when you have quadratic equations, there are two solutions, but not always. Our two solutions in this case are x equals negative 5 and x equals 1. Like we just said, there could be two solutions or there could be one solution or no solutions. Let's have a look at some examples. So here is the graph of y equals 2x squared minus 4x plus 1. If I want to know when that equals 7, you'll see we have two solutions. When that equals 3, again we have two solutions. We might not be able to tell exactly what they are because they're between integer coordinates. But we do have two solutions and they're approximately negative 0.4 and 2.4. So where on the graph is that only one solution? Can you write an equation that has one solution? See if you can do this. can do this. Well, if you spotted it's at that very bottom point of the curve, it's where x is 1 and y is negative 1. What that means is the equation 2x squared minus 4x plus 1 equals negative 1 only has one solution. Can you think of an equation then that will have no solutions? Okay, it's going to be anywhere below that bottom point of the curve. So for example, 2x squared minus 4x plus 1 equals negative 2. Or essentially, that expression equal to any value less than negative 1. And it's that point of the graph underneath that bottom point of the curve. We can add a context, just like we did with linear graphs. So this is the horizontal and vertical distance of a shot put throw. Why do you think the graph stops when we get to 20, 0? OK, well, that's going to be where the shot put lands on the ground again, because it can't go lower than 0 metres above the ground, unless it's going through the ground, of course. If we want to know the horizontal distance when the shot put is a height of three, we find a height of three. And then we read down to find our horizontal distances. The challenge with these questions is always reading the context and understanding what the graph is showing you. What is the highest point that the shot put reaches? Can you find it? So the highest point is four metres, making sure you're reading off the right value. Quick check then. So this parabola models an athlete completing a pole vault jump. You've got horizontal and vertical distance. What was the highest point reached by the athlete? Off you go. out of those options it has to be 6.25 right how far has the athlete traveled horizontally when they are four meters above the ground what do you think okay so we need to find four meters above the ground. And you'll see that there's two solutions, one when the horizontal distance is 0.2, then obviously on their way back down again, when the horizontal distance is 0.8. Time for you to have a go. I'd like you to use the table of values to plot the parabola with equation x squared minus 2x minus 3 and then use it to find the solution to those equations. Off you go. For question two, I would like you to read the context carefully and then use that to answer the questions, making sure you're thinking about units and full sentences where necessary. Off you go. And this time we've got an Olympic diver. Again, make sure you read the graph carefully and then answer the questions. Off you go. Let's have a look at our answers then. I've used graphing software, so my graph is perfect. However, if you plotted this by hand, it might not be exactly the same as mine. What you want to do is check for key coordinates. Does it go through the coordinate negative 2, 5? Does it go through the coordinate 0, negative 3? Does it have a lowest value at 1, negative 4? And does it have that line of symmetry? Use the table of values to check you've got the right points. Your solutions then, roughly negative 1.8 and 3.8. Again, that's going to depend a little bit on how your graph is drawn. You should get exactly negative 1 and 3. And you can see that from the table of values as well. You can see we've got negative 1, 0 and 3, 0. And you've got one solution of x equals 1 for that last one. And again, you can see that in your table of values. For our penguin, then, can you make sure you've checked that your table of values is correct? And again, you should have a nice, smooth curve for your parabola. You should have a line of symmetry when x equals 4. Why did the table of values start at zero? Well that means zero minutes, so that's when the penguin is starting the dive. It does not make sense to have negative values for minutes. The deepest point that the penguin got to was 160 It was underwater for eight minutes and then 70 meters below sea level was after one minute. And then they returned again after seven minutes. Penguins can actually dive under the water for a really long time. And some emperor penguins can actually get to a depth of 300 meters. emperor penguins can actually get to a depth of 300 meters. So our Olympic diver, well done if you spotted that the person writing that article has not understood what the graph is about. The x-axis is representing horizontal distance, not time. There's no way to gather any information about time from this graph. It's not uncommon for graphs to be incorrect or for people to misinterpret graphs. So it is something that's actually worth keeping your eye out for when you're watching other people working with graphs. Something like 11 meters was the highest point the diver reached and they had moved 0.2 meters horizontally to reach this height. If you think about diving off a diving board, you're obviously going to have to go forwards as well to clear the diving board before you start falling back towards the water. See, 0.410 is the moment where the diver was in line with the starting point again. So like we said, they need to have cleared the diving board so it has moved 0.4 meters horizontally and is back at the same height as where they jumped from. Well I hope you feel like you're really secure now in your understanding of graphs and that you're going to be able to use those going forward. We've looked at plotting linear graphs and the different ways that you might want to go about doing that including a table of values and this idea of gradient and y-intercept. We can use linear graphs to find solutions to equations. And we can put those in context as well and find solutions to problems. We can do exactly the same with linear graphs as with quadratic graphs. Just remembering that they're not going to form a straight line, so you have to be able to draw a curve as neatly as you can through the points, or use graphing software and technology to get it perfect. Remember as well that we can have no solutions, one solution or two solutions from a quadratic equation, and you've seen how we can tell that from the shape of the graph. And then we had some fun playing around with some different real life scenarios, some different Olympic sports, and we found out some fun stuff about penguins. Thank you for joining me in today's lesson and I look forward to seeing you again. again.","completion":"It seems like you just recapped a comprehensive tutorial on both linear and quadratic graphs, including how to plot them, understand their equations, and apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems. Here's a brief summary based on what you've detailed: 1. **Plotting Linear Graphs:** - The y-intercept and gradient (slope) are critical for plotting a linear graph. For example, with a y-intercept of -6 and a gradient of 3, you can plot this by moving up 3 units vertically for every 1 unit moved horizontally. - You can also plot a linear graph by finding two points that satisfy the equation and drawing a line through them. For the equation (2x + 3y = 12), you can find the x and y-intercepts by setting y and then x to zero, respectively. 2. **Rearranging Equations:** - To easily plot or analyze a graph, it's useful to rearrange equations into the form (y = mx + c), where (m) is the gradient and (c) is the y-intercept. 3. **Linear Graphs and Equations:** - Linear graphs can be used to solve equations graphically by finding where the line crosses a certain value. - For example, to solve (8x - 10 = 2), plot the line of (y = 8x - 10) and find the x-value that corresponds to (y = 2). 4. **Understanding Real-world Scenarios:** - Graphs represent real scenarios, such as conversion charts (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit), and can answer practical questions. 5. **Plotting Quadratic Graphs:** - Quadratic graphs form parabolas. By plotting values from an equation like (y = x^2), you can see the curve that represents the quadratic relationship. - The vertex of the parabola is particularly interesting, as it represents either the maximum or minimum point of the graph, based on the context of the problem. 6. **Solving Quadratic Equations Graphically:** - Quadratic equations can have two solutions, one solution (where the graph just touches the x-axis), or no real solutions (where the graph doesn't touch the x-axis). - By plotting a quadratic equation and then drawing a horizontal line at the value you're solving for, the intersection points give the solutions. 7. **Applications to Real-world Problems:** - Quadratic graphs can model scenarios like the height and distance traveled by an athlete in a jump, or the path of a projectile. - Interpretation of the graph requires understanding of the axes and what they represent in the scenario. 8. **Practical Exercises:** - You provided exercises to practice plotting and interpreting both linear and quadratic graphs within different contexts: athletics, plumbing charges, emperor penguins’ diving depths, and more. - These exercises help embed the theoretical knowledge into practical understanding and problem-solving skills. This overview demonstrates the importance of graphs in mathematics, emphasizing how they serve as a bridge between abstract equations and tangible, real-world applications. By mastering graphing skills, one can tackle a wide range of problems, from simple calculations to complex scenarios encountered in science, economics, and everyday life."},{"prompt":"Split each sentence from the text: Thank you for joining us in this lesson.

If you're not sure about the difference, pause the video and read those definitions. We're also going to talk about parabolas. If you haven't come across them before, a parabola is a curve. It's got some special features. The most important part is that they have a line of symmetry and that quadratic graphs are called parabolas. Read through the formal definition if you need to now. So we're going to start by reviewing linear graphs. We can plot the graphs of equations. You've probably done this in a few different ways in the past. One method is to use a table of values. So we're just going to do a little bit of a recap of how this works. So if I wanted to draw the graph of y equals 2x, I can think of some x values, put them into a table, and then come up with some y values. So because y has to be 2x, I just need to double my x values. If I wanted to draw the line with equation y equals 4 minus 2x, I do exactly the same thing. Come up with some x coordinates, and then I need y coordinates, which is 4 minus 2 lots of the x coordinate. If you want to pause and check my answers, feel free to do so. If you want to pause and check my answers, feel free to do so. Then all we need to do is plot our points. And they're both linear relationships, so they're both going to form a straight line. Don't forget that when you draw your lines, they should go across the entire page because the relationship continues beyond our plotted points. So Alex says, if we know the equation is linear, we do not need a whole table of values. We can just use features of the graph instead. Jun says, if I want to draw the graph of y equals 3x minus 6, I know the gradient is 3 and the y intercept is 0, negative 6. So we can use those features to plot a graph. So if we plot the y intercept, which for this graph is going to be negative 6, and then we need a gradient of 3, And then we need a gradient of 3. And then we can draw in our line. A gradient of 3 means we're stepping one right and three up to get to the next coordinate, one right and three up to get to the coordinate after that, and so on. Let's think about this graph. We've got 2x plus 3y equals 12. How would you go about drawing that graph? Have a think. So Jun would like to rearrange it into the form y equals mx plus c, and then use the gradient and the y-incept. Alex isn't so sure. Alex says we only need two pairs of coordinates, so we could just find two coordinates that satisfy that relationship. Of course, both methods are going to work. You might want to pause the video and just have a think about what you would do. So let's have a look at rearranging. So if we subtract 2x from both sides, we've got 3y equals 12 minus 2x. Divide by 3, we get negative 2 thirds x plus 4. Now, we could absolutely use the y-intercept of 4 and a gradient of negative 2 thirds x to draw this line. However, you might think that negative two thirds x is a little bit of a difficult gradient to use. So let's think about what Alex's method entails. So Alex says we just need two coordinates that fit this rule. Well, if we've got something in the form ax plus by equals c, there's two coordinates that's quite easy to find. y equals c. There's two coordinates that's quite easy to find. Any two coordinates would work, but we're going to look at the x-intercept and the y-intercept. They're often the most efficient. Because the x-intercept is where y is 0, if we substitute y as 0 into our equation, we can find the x-intercept. So we've got 2x plus 3 lots of 0 equals 12. 3 lots of 0 is of course 0, so 2x is 12, and x is 6. So when y is 0, x is 6. If we do the y-intercept as well, remember that's when x is 0. So we substitute x equals 0 into our equation. 3y is 12 and y is 4. So when x is 0, y is 4. We've now got two coordinates that we could plot and then draw in our line. Let's have a look. The coordinates are reasonably far apart, so it's going to be quite accurate to draw in a line between the two. You might want to check that your gradient is constant all the way along that line. Time to have a check then. So three oak pupils plot in the line 2y plus 4x equals 4. They're going to do it in some different ways. So Jun wants to use the gradient and the y-intercept. He says the gradient is negative 4 and the y-incept is 0, 4. Can you spot what mistake he has made? Well done if you spotted that he has not made y the subject. It still says 2y equals. In order to find the gradient and the y-incept, we need this in the form y equals mx plus c. So if he divides every term by two, then he'll make y the subject, and then he'll be able to read off the gradient and the y-incept. Sam's going to do it a different way. Sam wants to use a table of values. Have a look at the purple box. What has Sam done first to make this easier? And then can you fill in the three missing values? Off you go. Let's see if we've got any of that mathematical language in here. So they have made y the subject. They've written it in the form y equals mx plus c. And that often makes it easier to use a table of values because you know how to find y given x. Well, then, if you've got the missing values as 8, 6 and negative 4. Remember, you can check that it's got a linear relationship to make sure you haven't made any mistakes. Finally, Alex is going to use the x and y intercepts. Complete their working to find the values for when x is 0 and y is 0, and then have a think about which of those three methods were your favourite. Off you go! So, when y is 0, you should get x as 1. And when x is 0, you get y as 2. Well, I think all three methods were nice in this case. The rearranging gave integer values, which was nice and easy to use. And the x and y intercepts both had integer coordinates, so they're going to be nice and easy to use. So whichever method is your favourite is absolutely fine. So now we've reviewed how to plot graphs, we can look at how we can use them to solve problems. To start with, we can use graphs to solve equations. So here's the graph of y equals 8x minus 10. Let's use it to solve 8x-10 equals 2. All we need to do is find a value for x, which makes this expression have a value of 2. So if we look for 2 on the y-axis, and often it's easier to draw in the line y equals 2. And then we can read off by looking down to the x-axis and finding the corresponding value. So the solution to 8x minus 10 equals 2 is when x equals 1.5. If you wanted to check, you could substitute 1.5 into the equation and see if it balances. So when a graph represents a scenario, we can actually interpret the coordinates in context. It's really important that you think about what it is you're actually working out, not just following a process. So this is a conversion graph. It converts degrees Celsius into degrees Fahrenheit. It has an equation of F equals 1.8 C plus 32. Notice we've labelled our x-axis temperature in degrees C and our y-axis temperature in degrees F. So what do you think about this one? What does the coordinate 032 mean in context? Can you write down or say out loud a sentence for what that coordinate is representing? Off you go. Maybe you said something like this. Zero degrees Celsius is the same as 32 degrees Fahrenheit. That is what that coordinate represents. So June has a friend who lives in America. She says that 60 degrees Fahrenheit is about 20 degrees Celsius. How can we use the graph to check the accuracy of this statement? How would you do this one? Okay, there's a couple of ways to do this one. What you could do is plot the coordinate 20, 60, which is what Jun says should be on our line. However, we can see clearly that it's not on the graph. So 20 degrees Celsius is not 60 degrees Fahrenheit. It might be reasonably close. Let's use another method to check how close. So if you actually look for 60 degrees Fahrenheit and then draw a vertical line down to your x-axis, you can see that it's a lot nearer to 15 degrees than it is to 20 degrees. There's actually quite a big difference, isn't there, between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. So Jun's friend probably should have said it's roughly 15 degrees C. And then we'd have a better understanding of what 60 degrees Fahrenheit is actually like. Time for you to have a go. I degrees C should be 50 degrees Fahrenheit. And 5 degrees Fahrenheit should be negative 15 degrees C. Just check the graph if you didn't get values close to those. Right, time to put those skills into practice. For our first question, I'd like you to use this graph to solve the following equations. Off you go and come back when you're ready for the next set. Well done. So this second set is in context. So Lucas volunteers at local playgroup. For his homework, he drew a distance time graph of a race that two children ran. You can see on the right hand side our distance time graph. I'd like you to answer these questions for the graph that Lucas has drawn. Make sure you're thinking about the context and writing your answers in full sentences where necessary. Off you go. Question three. So a plumber calculates the amount to charge a customer using this linear relationship. It includes a call-out fee and a price per hour. I'd like you to think about that context when you answer these four questions. Off you go, come back when you're ready for the answers. So for the first one, you should have x is 3, then x is 0, then x is negative 2.4. Make sure you're happy with reading off decimal values on a graph. And then dx is negative 3. So let's think about this context now then. So child 1 ran 4 metres in 2 seconds. If you you just wrote four you haven't answered the question properly so four meters for b should be three seconds and c i wonder if you noticed that child two started further ahead so the y intercept is saying that zero seconds, so before the race has started, the child is already two meters. So that probably represents a two meter head start in this context. 5.10 and 8.10. So 5.10 means that child one took five seconds to run 10 meters. And 8.10 says that child two took 8 seconds to run 10 metres. 10 metres is probably the length of the race. Now, you could have combined that with your previous answer and said that actually Child 2 didn't run 10 metres. They actually only ran 8 metres. But to get 10 metres away from where they should have started, it took them 8 seconds. And the last one, there's some different answers you could have come up with here. You might have said something like, they don't run at a steady pace. Normally you'd accelerate at the beginning and then slow down later on, whereas a straight line graph suggests you're at the same speed all the way through. For a plumber, 0.80 suggests that a job that takes zero hours costs £80. You might have said that this was a call out fee. For B, you should have £120. For C, 10 hours. And then the price per hour is actually the gradient of this line. If you think about every hour you add on, how much does the price go up? We can see from the line that if you add on two hours, the price goes up £20. So for every hour, it's £10. So £10 per hour. Well done. We're now going to have a go at reviewing our quadratic graphs. So we can use a table of values to plot quadratic graphs too. Let's have a look at y equals x squared. So if we square our x values, remembering that when we square a negative value, we get a positive value, and then we can plot our values on a graph. Of course, this is not a linear equation, so it does not form a linear graph. Therefore, we cannot draw a straight line. We can see that really clearly. y equals x squared is a quadratic equation. Its graph is called a parabola. And what we can do is draw a curve instead. Jacob has noticed that we've got a line of symmetry, and in this case it's the y-axis. Okay, let's have a go with some trickier quadratic equations. We're going to do y equals 2x squared minus 4x. But we do exactly the same thing. We just need to substitute the required values for x. I would suggest that you start with zero and then the positive values and then go back to the negative values. The positive values are generally easier. And then you can look at some patterns to make sure you get the right values for the negative x. If you're using a calculator, make sure that you're putting brackets around your substituted value. Right, we've done the first three. Sam says, have we done something wrong? The y-coordinate is zero again. What do you think? y-coordinate is zero again. What do you think? No, our working out is perfect. It's just that there is a line of symmetry somewhere on a parabola. Therefore, it is common for there to be repeated values in the table. It doesn't always happen, but it is usual with a quadratic graph to see repeated values in the table. Let's finish off our positive values. Let's have a think now. What do we expect x equals negative two and x equals negative one to produce? See if you use Jacob's idea about symmetry. OK, let's try it out. We should have 6 and 16. I wonder if that's what you predicted looking at those values. And you can see we have got a line of symmetry because the values are repeated either side of when x is 1. Alex is having a go at plotting this one. is 1. Alex is having a go at plotting this one. I think when x is negative 1, the y value will be 4 because parabolas have a line of symmetry. I'd like you to substitute into this equation to see if Alex is correct. Off you go. Right, whether you're doing this by hand or using a calculator, you need to make sure you put brackets around the value you're substituting. So we should have negative one all squared plus two lots of negative one plus one. Negative one squared is one, so we've got one, add negative two, add one, and that gives us zero. So Alex is incorrect. There is going to be a line of symmetry somewhere, but it's not always the y-axis. So there could be a line of symmetry somewhere else in the table, or there might not even be in the table of values. It might be somewhere else on the graph. So like with linear equations, we can solve quadratic equations using their graph. So let's do x squared plus 4x plus 1 equals 6. First, we can draw the graph. And then we want to know when this is equal to 6. So if you draw the line y equals 6, you'll see that we have two solutions. Often when you have quadratic equations, there are two solutions, but not always. Our two solutions in this case are x equals negative 5 and x equals 1. Like we just said, there could be two solutions or there could be one solution or no solutions. Let's have a look at some examples. So here is the graph of y equals 2x squared minus 4x plus 1. If I want to know when that equals 7, you'll see we have two solutions. When that equals 3, again we have two solutions. We might not be able to tell exactly what they are because they're between integer coordinates. But we do have two solutions and they're approximately negative 0.4 and 2.4. So where on the graph is that only one solution? Can you write an equation that has one solution? See if you can do this. can do this. Well, if you spotted it's at that very bottom point of the curve, it's where x is 1 and y is negative 1. What that means is the equation 2x squared minus 4x plus 1 equals negative 1 only has one solution. Can you think of an equation then that will have no solutions? Okay, it's going to be anywhere below that bottom point of the curve. So for example, 2x squared minus 4x plus 1 equals negative 2. Or essentially, that expression equal to any value less than negative 1. And it's that point of the graph underneath that bottom point of the curve. We can add a context, just like we did with linear graphs. So this is the horizontal and vertical distance of a shot put throw. Why do you think the graph stops when we get to 20, 0? OK, well, that's going to be where the shot put lands on the ground again, because it can't go lower than 0 metres above the ground, unless it's going through the ground, of course. If we want to know the horizontal distance when the shot put is a height of three, we find a height of three. And then we read down to find our horizontal distances. The challenge with these questions is always reading the context and understanding what the graph is showing you. What is the highest point that the shot put reaches? Can you find it? So the highest point is four metres, making sure you're reading off the right value. Quick check then. So this parabola models an athlete completing a pole vault jump. You've got horizontal and vertical distance. What was the highest point reached by the athlete? Off you go. out of those options it has to be 6.25 right how far has the athlete traveled horizontally when they are four meters above the ground what do you think okay so we need to find four meters above the ground. And you'll see that there's two solutions, one when the horizontal distance is 0.2, then obviously on their way back down again, when the horizontal distance is 0.8. Time for you to have a go. I'd like you to use the table of values to plot the parabola with equation x squared minus 2x minus 3 and then use it to find the solution to those equations. Off you go. For question two, I would like you to read the context carefully and then use that to answer the questions, making sure you're thinking about units and full sentences where necessary. Off you go. And this time we've got an Olympic diver. Again, make sure you read the graph carefully and then answer the questions. Off you go. Let's have a look at our answers then. I've used graphing software, so my graph is perfect. However, if you plotted this by hand, it might not be exactly the same as mine. What you want to do is check for key coordinates. Does it go through the coordinate negative 2, 5? Does it go through the coordinate 0, negative 3? Does it have a lowest value at 1, negative 4? And does it have that line of symmetry? Use the table of values to check you've got the right points. Your solutions then, roughly negative 1.8 and 3.8. Again, that's going to depend a little bit on how your graph is drawn. You should get exactly negative 1 and 3. And you can see that from the table of values as well. You can see we've got negative 1, 0 and 3, 0. And you've got one solution of x equals 1 for that last one. And again, you can see that in your table of values. For our penguin, then, can you make sure you've checked that your table of values is correct? And again, you should have a nice, smooth curve for your parabola. You should have a line of symmetry when x equals 4. Why did the table of values start at zero? Well that means zero minutes, so that's when the penguin is starting the dive. It does not make sense to have negative values for minutes. The deepest point that the penguin got to was 160 It was underwater for eight minutes and then 70 meters below sea level was after one minute. And then they returned again after seven minutes. Penguins can actually dive under the water for a really long time. And some emperor penguins can actually get to a depth of 300 meters. emperor penguins can actually get to a depth of 300 meters. So our Olympic diver, well done if you spotted that the person writing that article has not understood what the graph is about. The x-axis is representing horizontal distance, not time. There's no way to gather any information about time from this graph. It's not uncommon for graphs to be incorrect or for people to misinterpret graphs. So it is something that's actually worth keeping your eye out for when you're watching other people working with graphs. Something like 11 meters was the highest point the diver reached and they had moved 0.2 meters horizontally to reach this height. If you think about diving off a diving board, you're obviously going to have to go forwards as well to clear the diving board before you start falling back towards the water. See, 0.410 is the moment where the diver was in line with the starting point again. So like we said, they need to have cleared the diving board so it has moved 0.4 meters horizontally and is back at the same height as where they jumped from. Well I hope you feel like you're really secure now in your understanding of graphs and that you're going to be able to use those going forward. We've looked at plotting linear graphs and the different ways that you might want to go about doing that including a table of values and this idea of gradient and y-intercept. We can use linear graphs to find solutions to equations. And we can put those in context as well and find solutions to problems. We can do exactly the same with linear graphs as with quadratic graphs. Just remembering that they're not going to form a straight line, so you have to be able to draw a curve as neatly as you can through the points, or use graphing software and technology to get it perfect. Remember as well that we can have no solutions, one solution or two solutions from a quadratic equation, and you've seen how we can tell that from the shape of the graph. And then we had some fun playing around with some different real life scenarios, some different Olympic sports, and we found out some fun stuff about penguins.

- How would you do this one? - Okay, there's a couple of ways to do this one. - What you could do is plot the coordinate 20, 60, which is what Jun says should be on our line. - However, we can see clearly that it's not on the graph. - So 20 degrees Celsius is not 60 degrees Fahrenheit. - It might be reasonably close. - Let's use another method to check how close. - So if you actually look for 60 degrees Fahrenheit and then draw a vertical line down to your x-axis, you can see that it's a lot nearer to 15 degrees than it is to 20 degrees. - There's actually quite a big difference, isn't there, between 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. - So Jun's friend probably should have said it's roughly 15 degrees C. - And then we'd have a better understanding of what 60 degrees Fahrenheit is actually like. - Time for you to have a go. - I degrees C should be 50 degrees Fahrenheit. - And 5 degrees Fahrenheit should be negative 15 degrees C. - Just check the graph if you didn't get values close to those. - Right, time to put those skills into practice. - For our first question, I'd like you to use this graph to solve the following equations. - Off you go and come back when you're ready for the next set. - Well done. - So this second set is in context. - So Lucas volunteers at local playgroup. - For his homework, he drew a distance time graph of a race that two children ran. - You can see on the right hand side our distance time graph. - I'd like you to answer these questions for the graph that Lucas has drawn. - Make sure you're thinking about the context and writing your answers in full sentences where necessary. - Off you go. - Question three. - So a plumber calculates the amount to charge a customer using this linear relationship. - It includes a call-out fee and a price per hour. - I'd like you to think about that context when you answer these four questions. - Off you go, come back when you're ready for the answers. - So for the first one, you should have x is 3, then x is 0, then x is negative 2.4. - Make sure you're happy with reading off decimal values on a graph. - And then dx is negative 3. - So let's think about this context now then. - So child 1 ran 4 metres in 2 seconds. - If you you just wrote four you haven't answered the question properly so four meters for b should be three seconds and c i wonder if you noticed that child two started further ahead so the y intercept is saying that zero seconds, so before the race has started, the child is already two meters. - So that probably represents a two meter head start in this context. - 5.10 and 8.10. - So 5.10 means that child one took five seconds to run 10 meters. - And 8.10 says that child two took 8 seconds to run 10 metres. - 10 metres is probably the length of the race. - Now, you could have combined that with your previous answer and said that actually Child 2 didn't run 10 metres. - They actually only ran 8 metres. - But to get 10 metres away from where they should have started, it took them 8 seconds. - And the last one, there's some different answers you could have come up with here. - You might have said something like, they don't run at a steady pace. - Normally you'd accelerate at the beginning and then slow down later on, whereas a straight line graph suggests you're at the same speed all the way through. - For a plumber, 0.80 suggests that a job that takes zero hours costs £80. - You might have said that this was a call out fee. - For B, you should have £120. - For C, 10 hours. - And then the price per hour is actually the gradient of this line. - If you think about every hour you add on, how much does the price go up? - We can see from the line that if you add on two hours, the price goes up £20. - So for every hour, it's £10. - So £10 per hour. - Well done. - We're now going to have a go at reviewing our quadratic graphs. - So we can use a table of values to plot quadratic graphs too. - Let's have a look at y equals x squared. - So if we square our x values, remembering that when we square a negative value, we get a positive value, and then we can plot our values on a graph. - Of course, this is not a linear equation, so it does not form a linear graph. - Therefore, we cannot draw a straight line. - We can see that really clearly. - y equals x squared is a quadratic equation. - Its graph is called a parabola. - And what we can do is draw a curve instead. - Jacob has noticed that we've got a line of symmetry, and in this case it's the y-axis. - Okay, let's have a go with some trickier quadratic equations. - We're going to do y equals 2x squared minus 4x. - But we do exactly the same thing. - We just need to substitute the required values for x. - I would suggest that you start with zero and then the positive values and then go back to the negative values. - The positive values are generally easier. - And then you can look at some patterns to make sure you get the right values for the negative x. - If you're using a calculator, make sure that you're putting brackets around your substituted value. - Right, we've done the first three. - Sam says, have we done something wrong? - The y-coordinate is zero again. - What do you think? - y-coordinate is zero again. - What do you think? - No, our working out is perfect. - It's just that there is a line of symmetry somewhere on a parabola. - Therefore, it is common for there to be repeated values in the table. - It doesn't always happen, but it is usual with a quadratic graph to see repeated values in the table. - Let's finish off our positive values. - Let's have a think now. - What do we expect x equals negative two and x equals negative one to produce? - See if you use Jacob's idea about symmetry. - OK, let's try it out. - We should have 6 and 16. - I wonder if that's what you predicted looking at those values. - And you can see we have got a line of symmetry because the values are repeated either side of when x is 1. - Alex is having a go at plotting this one. - is 1. - Alex is having a go at plotting this one. - I think when x is negative 1, the y value will be 4 because parabolas have a line of symmetry. - I'd like you to substitute into this equation to see if Alex is correct. - Off you go. - Right, whether you're doing this by hand or using a calculator, you need to make sure you put brackets around the value you're substituting. - So we should have negative one all squared plus two lots of negative one plus one. - Negative one squared is one, so we've got one, add negative two, add one, and that gives us zero. - So Alex is incorrect. - There is going to be a line of symmetry somewhere, but it's not always the y-axis. - So there could be a line of symmetry somewhere else in the table, or there might not even be in the table of values. - It might be somewhere else on the graph. - So like with linear equations, we can solve quadratic equations using their graph. - So let's do x squared plus 4x plus 1 equals 6. - First, we can draw the graph. - And then we want to know when this is equal to 6. - So if you draw the line y equals 6, you'll see that we have two solutions. - Often when you have quadratic equations, there are two solutions, but not always. - Our two solutions in this case are x equals negative 5 and x equals 1. - Like we just said, there could be two solutions or there could be one solution or no solutions. - Let's have a look at some examples. - So here is the graph of y equals 2x squared minus 4x plus 1. - If I want to know when that equals 7, you'll see we have two solutions. - When that equals 3, again we have two solutions. - We might not be able to tell exactly what they are because they're between integer coordinates. - But we do have two solutions and they're approximately negative 0.4 and 2.4. - So where on the graph is that only one solution? - Can you write an equation that has one solution? - See if you can do this. - can do this. - Well, if you spotted it's at that very bottom point of the curve, it's where x is 1 and y is negative 1. - What that means is the equation 2x squared minus 4x plus 1 equals negative 1 only has one solution. - Can you think of an equation then that will have no solutions?"},{"prompt":"Mi poi aiutare a pompiere un app con mit app invento","completion":"Certo!

HPLC was done to determine this on an experiental batch of pectin from microwave-assisted extraction of Keitt mangoes. The results of the HPLC are as follows: 37.2% galacturonic acid, 23.5% cellulose, 11.2% Xylose/Fructose/Mannose/Rhamnose ( hemicellulose and hairy pectin regions) , 16.8% Arabinose, 7.1% Levoglucansan and 4.2% others (formic acid, acetic acid and levulinic acid). Talk in depth about why the galacturonic acid content is so low.","completion":"The galacturonic acid (GalA) content is a crucial quality indicator for pectin, largely influencing its gelling abilities and overall commercial value. According to the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the threshold for galacturonic acid content in pectin should be no less than 65%. In the provided HPLC analysis of the experimental batch of pectin extracted from Keitt mangoes through microwave-assisted extraction, the galacturonic acid content was found to be significantly lower at 37.2%. This discrepancy prompts a detailed examination of potential factors that could contribute to such a reduced level of galacturonic acid. Various aspects, including the peculiarities of microwave-assisted extraction, the raw material used, and the overall composition, offer insights into why the galacturonic acid content is considerably lower than the JECFA threshold. # Microwave-Assisted Extraction Efficiency Microwave-assisted extraction is known for its efficiency in extracting bioactive compounds from plant materials due to its rapid heating and penetration capabilities. However, the efficiency of extracting pectin, particularly high galacturonic acid content pectin, can be influenced by several parameters: 1. **Temperature and Time:** Microwave extraction parameters such as temperature and time need to be carefully optimized. Too high temperatures or prolonged exposure times can lead to degradation of galacturonic acid, thereby reducing its content in the final pectin extract. 2. **Solvent pH:** The pH of the extraction medium significantly affects the pectin yield and its galacturonic acid content. Acidic conditions are generally favorable for pectin extraction but must be precisely controlled to optimize GalA yield and avoid hydrolysis. 3. **Raw Material Particle Size**: The size of the material can impact the extraction efficiency, as smaller particles might allow for better release of pectin but could also lead to a more complex mixture requiring further purification. # Source Material Variation The type of source material, in this case, Keitt mangoes, plays a pivotal role in determining the galacturonic acid content. Factors include: 1. **Varietal Differences:** Different varieties of mangoes might have inherently different compositions of pectin with varying levels of galacturonic acid. 2. **Ripeness of Fruit:** The stage of ripeness can influence the quality and quantity of pectin. Generally, underripe fruits have higher pectin content of better quality (i.e., higher GalA content), while overripe fruits may have lower quality pectin due to natural enzymatic breakdown. 3. **Extraction from Specific Parts:** The part of the mango from which pectin is extracted (e.g., peel, pulp) could also contribute to variance in GalA content, with different parts yielding pectin of differing qualities. # Analytical and Compositional Influences The analytical methodology (HPLC in this case) and the overall composition of the extracted pectin, as detailed in the results, also hint at reasons behind the low galacturonic acid content: 1. **Presence of Other Polysaccharides:** The significant percentages of cellulose, xylose/fructose/mannose/rhamnose, arabinose, and levoglucansan indicate a broad spectrum of polysaccharides other than pectin. This diversity points towards an incomplete or non-selective extraction process, where not just the desired pectin (rich in GalA) was extracted but also other materials, diluting the overall GalA content. 2. **Degradation Products:** The presence of formic acid, acetic acid, and levulinic acid (grouped under \\"others\\") could indicate degradation of sugars or galacturonic acid itself during the extraction process, possibly due to the conditions applied (e.g., high temperature, incorrect pH). # Conclusion To address the aforementioned challenges and achieve a higher galacturonic acid content in pectin extracts, optimization of the microwave-assisted extraction process by adjusting parameters like temperature, time, and solvent pH carefully is crucial. Additionally, understanding the influence of the source material—specifically variety, ripeness, and part of the fruit used for extraction—is essential for selecting the optimal raw material. Refinement of the extraction and purification processes to more selectively target pectin rich in GalA, alongside employing analytical techniques that might provide a more accurate quantification of galacturonic acid, could help in conforming to the JECFA standards."},{"prompt":"what about mannose","completion":"Mannose is a type of sugar, specifically a monosaccharide, which means it's one of the simplest forms of sugar. Chemically, it is categorized as a hexose, a subgroup of monosaccharides that contain six carbon atoms. Mannose is structurally similar to glucose but differs in the arrangement of the hydroxyl group (-OH) at the second carbon atom. This structural difference makes mannose behave differently in biological systems compared to glucose. In the context of your experimental batch of pectin and its analysis, mannose was mentioned as part of the group constituting 11.2% of the content, which also includes xylose, fructose, and rhamnose. These sugars are typically found in what is known as the \\"hemicellulose and hairy pectin regions.\\" # Role and Importance of Mannose in Pectin and Plant Polysaccharides 1. **Hairy Pectin Regions:** Mannose is often found in the side chains of the pectin molecule. Pectin is a complex plant polysaccharide structure comprised of a smooth region (mainly galacturonic acid units) and hairy regions. The hairy regions contain various neutral sugars, including mannose, in their side chains. These regions contribute to the overall functionality and properties of pectin, affecting its gelling behavior, solubility, and interaction with other molecules. 2. **Source Material Variation:** The content and composition of mannose in pectin can vary depending on the source material. Different plants or different parts of the same plant may yield pectin with different structures and sugar compositions. This variation underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate raw material for pectin extraction, aimed at obtaining a product with desired properties. 3. **Impact on Pectin Properties:** The presence of mannose and other neutral sugars in pectin influences its properties in numerous ways. For instance, a higher degree of branching (with side chains containing mannose and other sugars) may affect the pectin's gelling ability, its interaction with water, and its overall solubility. This highlights the complexity of pectin as a biomolecule and the intricate role various sugars, including mannose, play in its structural and functional attributes. # Considerations for Analysis and Optimization Given the presence of mannose and other sugars in your pectin extract, it might be beneficial to further explore and optimize the extraction process. Factors such as the source material, extraction conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, duration), and purification steps could be tuned to potentially enhance the yield of high-quality pectin with a preferable composition. For instance, certain extraction methods might be more selective towards extracting pectin with higher galacturonic acid content while minimizing the extraction of other polysaccharides and sugars. Understanding the complex interplay between different constituents in pectin, including mannose, is crucial for tailoring the extraction and refinement processes. This ensures the production of pectin with desired properties for specific food applications, pharmaceuticals, or other industrial uses, in line with the standards and expectations for high-quality pectin products."},{"prompt":"levoglucansan","completion":"It seems there was a misunderstanding or typographical error in your question concerning \\"levoglucansan.\\" Based on the context, you are likely referring to \\"levoglucosan,\\" a specific organic compound. Let's explore levoglucosan in detail, correcting the name and providing accurate information. # What is Levoglucosan? Levoglucosan (C6H10O5) is a type of anhydrosugar, specifically a 1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucopyranose. It's created through the pyrolysis (thermal decomposition in the absence of oxygen) of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starches. When pyrolysis occurs, the glycosidic bonds within these polysaccharides break, resulting in smaller molecules, one of which is levoglucosan. It is considered a primary pyrolysis product and is often used as a marker for biomass burning and a tracer for studying atmospheric processing of organic aerosols. # Levoglucosan in the Context of Pectin Analysis In the HPLC analysis of an experimental batch of pectin from Keitt mangoes, the presence of levoglucosan (assuming this is what was meant by \\"levoglucansan\\") at 7.1% suggests that thermal decomposition processes might have influenced the pectin extract. This can happen if the microwave-assisted extraction process involves high temperatures that partly lead to the pyrolysis of certain sugars present in the mango material. The formation of levoglucosan and its detection in your analysis indicate a few points of concern and interest: 1. **Extraction Temperature:** The extraction temperature is critical in microwave-assisted processes. Too high a temperature can not only degrade desirable pectin components but also result in the unintended formation of compounds like levoglucosan through the thermal breakdown of polysaccharides. 2. **Purity of the Pectin Extract:** The presence of levoglucosan, as well as other non-pectin polysaccharides and monosaccharides, highlights the complex nature of the extracted material. It suggests that the extraction process was not highly selective for pectin, leading to a mixture of various polysaccharides and degradation products. 3. **Implications for Pectin Quality:** The quality of pectin is primarily determined by its galacturonic acid content and molecular weight. The occurrence of decomposition products like levoglucosan could imply that the pectin may have undergone partial degradation, potentially affecting its gelling properties and overall quality. # Addressing the Levoglucosan Issue To minimize the formation of levoglucosan and ensure a higher quality of pectin extract, it may be necessary to: - **Optimize Extraction Conditions:** Carefully adjust the microwave-assisted extraction parameters, including temperature and time, to limit the degradation of polysaccharides. - **Implement Purification Steps:** After extraction, use purification methods designed to enhance the selectivity for pectin, such as alcohol precipitation, dialysis, or membrane filtration, to remove unwanted by-products and polysaccharides. - **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor the extraction process closely through analytical methods to identify the optimum conditions that minimize degradation and by-product formation. By addressing these factors, the extraction process can be optimized to reduce the formation of by-products like levoglucosan and enhance the yield and purity of the desired high-galacturonic acid content pectin."},{"prompt":"could the results denoted as 'others' be galacturonic acid lysis products?","completion":"The \\"others\\" category in your HPLC results, which includes compounds like formic acid, acetic acid, and levulinic acid, indeed suggests the presence of degradation or lysis products. While these specific organic acids are general by-products in various chemical processes, they can also result from the degradation of pectin, including the lysis of galacturonic acid under certain conditions. Let's delve into how this connection could be plausible and its implications. # Connection to Galacturonic Acid Lysis Galacturonic acid, the main component of pectin, can undergo degradation under certain thermal or acidic conditions, which might be encountered during the extraction or processing of pectin. This degradation can produce various smaller molecules, including monosaccharides and organic acids: - **Formic Acid and Acetic Acid**: These two acids can be formed through the oxidative breakdown of galacturonic acid. Thermal technologies like microwave-assisted extraction, if not adequately controlled, can induce such oxidative conditions, leading to the cleavage of galacturonic acid and formation of smaller organic acids. - **Levulinic Acid**: This is another degradation product that can form from the acid-catalyzed degradation of hexoses, including the breakdown products of galacturonic acid. The pathway typically involves dehydration reactions, further breaking down sugars or their derivatives to smaller compounds. # Implications of Galacturonic Acid Lysis 1. **Reduced Pectin Quality**: The presence of galacturonic acid lysis products suggests that the pectin might have partially degraded, potentially affecting its gelling properties, molecular weight, and overall utility as a functional food ingredient. The quality of pectin, especially for commercial applications, is largely dependent on its galacturonic acid content and integrity. 2. **Extraction Conditions**: The detection of these by-products emphasizes the need for careful optimization of extraction conditions. Parameters such as temperature, pH, and extraction duration must be controlled to minimize the degradation of galacturonic acid and preserve the quality of the extracted pectin. 3. **Analytical Insights**: The identification of these by-products in your analysis is crucial for understanding the chemical processes occurring during extraction. It indicates that your analytical methods are capable of detecting not only the desired pectin components but also possible degradation products, offering insights into how to improve the extraction process. # Addressing the Issue To minimize the degradation of galacturonic acid and improve the yield and quality of pectin: - **Optimize Microwave-Assisted Extraction Parameters**: Carefully control the microwave-assisted extraction parameters to avoid excessive temperatures and acidic conditions that could lead to galacturonic acid degradation. - **Post-Extraction Purification**: Implement purification steps designed to remove low molecular weight degradation products, thereby enriching the pectin extract in its desired high molecular weight components. - **Improve Process Monitoring**: Enhancing the monitoring of the extraction process through analytical techniques helps in identifying the optimal conditions that minimize degradation and by-product formation. Understanding the connection between extraction conditions, the formation of lysis products, and the quality of pectin is essential for optimizing both the extraction process and the utility of the extracted pectin."},{"prompt":"Traduit en français \\"\\"Совсем \\"недлявсехний\\" концептуальный альбом Чеслава Немана, посвящённый проблемам, с которыми, как тогда наивно считали, совсем скоро столкнётся человечество при освоении дальнего космоса.

Esto se hace para evitar confusiones y errores al tratar de acceder a los datos de dichas columnas. Si quieres evitar este comportamiento y manejar tú mismo/a los nombres de las columnas, hay varias estrategias que puedes seguir: # 1. Renombrar las columnas manualmente Después de leer el archivo, puedes renombrar las columnas manualmente usando \`.columns\`: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd df = pd.read_excel('archivo.xlsx') df.columns = ['nombre1', 'nombre2', 'nombre3', ..., 'nombren'] \`\`\` Esto requiere que sepas de antemano el número de columnas y sus nombres deseados, lo cual puede no ser práctico en todos los casos. # 2. Usar el parámetro \`header\` para especificar la fila de encabezado Si los nombres duplicados no son necesarios para tu análisis, puedes especificar una fila diferente como encabezados si los nombres de columnas únicos están en otra fila: \`\`\`python df = pd.read_excel('archivo.xlsx', header=otra_fila) \`\`\` # 3. Evitar automáticamente nombres duplicados en pandas Una alternativa es permitir que pandas maneje los nombres duplicados, pero luego procesar el \`DataFrame\` para identificar y tratar las columnas duplicadas según tus necesidades. Sin embargo, si lo que deseas es evitar completamente que pandas añada estos números, necesitarás anticiparte a la lectura de los datos y ajustar los nombres de las columnas en el propio Excel o justo después de leer el archivo y antes de hacer cualquier otra operación. Para prevenir la duplicidad puedes hacer lo siguiente antes de leer el archivo: - **Modificar el archivo Excel original para tener nombres de columnas únicos.** Esto puede ser lo más práctico si tienes control total sobre los datos de entrada. - **Leer solo la fila de nombres de columnas, procesarla para hacer los nombres únicos, y luego leer el resto del archivo con estos nombres.** # 4. Leer la hoja y renombrar duplicados programáticamente Si realmente necesitas tratar con duplicados de una manera personalizada, podrías leer primero la fila de encabezado, modificar los nombres para hacerlos únicos según tu criterio y luego leer el contenido completo: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Leer solo la primera fila para obtener los encabezados encabezados = pd.read_excel('archivo.xlsx', nrows=0) # Procesar los nombres de encabezados para hacerlos únicos según tu lógica nuevos_nombres = ['nombre1_mod', 'nombre2_mod', ...] # Leer el archivo con los nuevos nombres de columnas df = pd.read_excel('archivo.xlsx', names=nuevos_nombres, header=0) \`\`\` # Conclusión La elección de estrategia dependerá de tu situación específica, como cuánto control tengas sobre el archivo de Excel y qué tanto te afecte tener nombres de columnas modificados automáticamente. En cualquier caso, manejar la duplicidad de nombres de columna manualmente te da más flexibilidad pero requiere un paso adicional de procesamiento."},{"prompt":"estoy usando este código: import pandas as pd class BiometricTableImporter: def __init__(self, file_path): self.file_path = file_path def import_table(self, sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows): df = pd.read_excel( self.file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, usecols=usecols, skiprows=skiprows, nrows=nrows ) return df if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": file_path = r\\"F:1AssegurancesMUTUALITATSMANUAL2 NORMATIVA5.-Taules actuarials3bis.-Anexos Resolución de 17 de diciembre de 2020.xlsx\\" importer = BiometricTableImporter(file_path) # Parámetros para la primera tabla sheet_name1 = \\"Anexo 2.1\\" usecols1 = \\"C: E\\" skiprows1 = 7 nrows1 = 121 PERF2020_COL_1 = importer.import_table(sheet_name1, usecols1, skiprows1, nrows1) si al importar quiero empezar por la fila donde está el primer número en el excel sin encabezado y así evitar la duplicidad de encabezaos, como lo hago?","completion":"Si lo que quieres es empezar a importar desde la primera fila que contiene un número, ajustando tu código para que pueda identificar esa fila automáticamente y usarla como el punto de inicio para la importación, te voy a sugerir un enfoque un poco más manual primero para después integrarlo en tu clase \`BiometricTableImporter\`. Este enfoque consiste en leer preliminarmente algunas filas para identificar dónde comienzan los datos numéricos. # Paso 1: Identificar la fila de inicio Primero, debes identificar programáticamente la fila desde la cual quieres empezar a leer. Esto lo puedes hacer leyendo las primeras N filas del archivo y comprobando cuál es la primera que contiene un número en alguna de las columnas que te interesan. Un pseudocódigo para esta tarea sería: 1. Leer el Excel con un número limitado de filas (\`nrows\`) y sin omitir filas (\`skiprows=0\`). Usar \`usecols\` para limitar a las columnas de interés podría hacer este paso más eficiente. 2. Iterar sobre las filas para encontrar la primera que contenga un valor numérico. 3.

La función \`find_first_numeric_row\` intenta detectar la primera fila que contiene un valor numérico en las columnas especificadas y utiliza ese índice ajustado como el parámetro \`skiprows\` para la importación final de datos.

Dado que especificaste \`usecols=\\"C:E\\"\`, se seleccionaron las columnas C, D, y E de tu archivo Excel, que son la 3ª, 4ª, y 5ª columnas respectivamente (contando desde cero). Sin embargo, debido a cómo pandas maneja esto internamente, las etiquetas de columna que asigna comienzan con 0 para la primera columna que lee basado en \`usecols\`. Por lo tanto, en este caso, te asignó 0, 1, y 2 a las columnas C, D, y E, respectivamente. Si ves los nombres 6, 7, y 8 como encabezados en lugar de 0, 1, y 2 como esperarías, esto puede ser un error en mi explicación previa o en cómo se interpretó. Bajo un comportamiento estándar y sin otra lógica personalizada que afecte el nombre de las columnas (por ejemplo, código adicional no mostrado que renombre estas columnas después de cargarlas), pandas debería asignar 0, 1, 2 como los nombres de esas columnas. Asegúrate de revisar que no haya otros pasos en tu proceso que alteren estos nombres después de la carga inicial. Para hacer referencia a la segunda columna (que esperarías fuese etiquetada como '1'), directamente puedes usar: \`\`\`python segunda_columna = PERF2020_COL_1[1] \`\`\` Si en tu caso, las columnas aparecen nombradas incorrectamente como 6, 7 y 8 y esto no se debe a procesos adicionales que renombran las columnas después de leer el archivo Excel, simplemente harías referencia a la segunda columna usando el número que observas: \`\`\`python segunda_columna = PERF2020_COL_1[7] # Si verdaderamente las columnas han sido nombradas como 6, 7, y 8. \`\`\` Recomiendo verificar la versión de pandas que estás utilizando y el contenido exacto del archivo para confirmar por qué se observa este comportamiento.

Este tipo de advertencia aparece frecuentemente en operaciones vectorizadas con NumPy o cálculos similares en pandas cuando intentas dividir por cero o realizar operaciones matemáticas con valores no válidos. En tu código, específicamente en esta línea: \`\`\`python self.ex[x] = lx_sum / self.lx[x] \`\`\` el aviso sugiere que en algún punto del cálculo, \`self.lx[x]\` contiene un valor 0 o no válido, lo que hace que la operación de división no se pueda ejecutar correctamente. En el contexto de cálculos actuariales, este tipo de situación puede surgir si estás proyectando poblaciones (\`lx\`) y llegas a un punto en el que la población se agota a 0 (o se inicializa a 0 por error) y todavía intentas realizar cálculos con ella. Para solucionar este problema, puedes: 1. Asegurarte de que todos los valores de \`self.lx\` son válidos (no cero o \`NaN\`) antes de realizar la división. Si un valor de \`self.lx[x]\` se espera que ocasionalmente sea 0 en el curso normal de tus cálculos, entonces deberías manejar esos casos adecuadamente para evitar la división por cero. 2. Una forma común de manejar este tipo de situaciones es utilizar una estructura condicional (como un \`if\`) para verificar el valor del denominador antes de realizar la división: \`\`\`python if self.lx[x] > 0: # Asegura que no intentes dividir por cero self.ex[x] = lx_sum / self.lx[x] else: self.ex[x] = np.nan # O asigna un valor que tenga sentido en el contexto de tu modelo \`\`\` 3. Además, si \`lx_sum\` puede ser 0 o un valor no válido que también pueda causar advertencias o errores, querrías incluir una verificación para eso también. Usar un condicional te permite manejar los casos donde la división sería inválida, ya sea asignando un valor predeterminado u omitiendo el cálculo para esos casos, evitando así generar advertencias o errores durante la ejecución de tu script. Revisar y limpiar tus entradas de datos (en este caso, los valores de \`self.lx\`) para asegurarte de que todos los valores son válidos y tienen sentido dentro del contexto de tus cálculos también puede ayudar a prevenir este tipo de problemas."},{"prompt":"teniendo este código como digo que me imprima la tabla generacional PERF2020_COL_1 de una mujer nacida en 1950","completion":"Si quieres imprimir una tabla generacional para una mujer nacida en 1950 utilizando el marco de código que has proporcionado en tus preguntas anteriores, necesitas hacer algunas suposiciones basadas en las funciones y clases que ya has compartido.

Voy a asumir que tienes una estructura de Excel donde una columna proporciona la serie de valores \`qx\` (por ejemplo, mortalidad) y otra columna proporciona los valores lambda correspondientes. Aquí te dejo un esquema de cómo podrías manejar esto: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd import numpy as np class ActuarialTable: def __init__(self, df: pd.DataFrame, birth_year: int, base_year: int, interest_rate: float = 0.03, l0: int = 100000): # Asumiendo que df contiene tanto qx_base como lambda_values en columnas separadas self.qx_base = df['qx_base'] / 1000 # Ajustar 'qx_base' al nombre de tu columna real self.lambda_values = df['lambda'] # Ajustar 'lambda' al nombre de tu columna real self.birth_year = birth_year self.base_year = base_year self.interest_rate = interest_rate self.l0 = l0 self.qx = self.adjust_qx_by_birth_year() # ...

Debes ajustar los nombres de columnas según cómo estén dispuestas realmente en tu archivo Excel. 2. Creas una instancia de \`ActuarialTable\` pasando el DataFrame que contiene tanto la serie \`qx_base\` como los valores lambda. 3. Dentro del constructor de \`ActuarialTable\`, divides \`qx_base\` por 1000 si es necesario (esto es común en datos actuariales donde las tasas de mortalidad están expresadas por mil). 4.

Una solución es verificar la presencia de los valores de lambda en las columnas específicas y usar una lógica condicional para seleccionar la columna correcta según la tabla que estás importando. Una forma de abordar esto es extender la funcionalidad de tu método \`import_table\` para incluir un argumento adicional que especificará la columna donde se esperan encontrar los valores lambda para cada tabla. Luego, podrías usar este argumento para seleccionar dinámicamente la columna lambda correspondiente en el DataFrame resultante. Aquí te dejo un ejemplo de cómo podrías hacer esto: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd class BiometricTableImporter: def __init__(self, file_path): self.file_path = file_path def import_table(self, sheet_name, usecols, skiprows, nrows, lambda_col=None): df = pd.read_excel( self.file_path, sheet_name=sheet_name, usecols=usecols, skiprows=skiprows, nrows=nrows, header=None ) if lambda_col is not None: # Extraer los valores de lambda y asignarlos a una nueva columna en el DataFrame lambda_values = df.iloc[:, lambda_col] df['lambda'] = lambda_values # Si deseas, puedes eliminar la columna original de lambda para evitar confusiones # df.drop(df.columns[lambda_col], axis=1, inplace=True) return df if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": file_path = \\"tu_ruta_de_archivo_aqui.xlsx\\" importer = BiometricTableImporter(file_path) # Ejemplo de uso con lambda en la tercera columna (índice 2, porque la indexación comienza en 0) PERF2020_COL_1 = importer.import_table(\\"Anexo 1\\", \\"C:F\\", skiprows=5, nrows=100, lambda_col=2) # Ejemplo de uso con lambda en la segunda columna (índice 1) PERF2020_COL_2 = importer.import_table(\\"Anexo 2\\", \\"C:F\\", skiprows=5, nrows=100, lambda_col=1) # Ahora, PERF2020_COL_1 y PERF2020_COL_2 tendrán una columna extra llamada 'lambda' # conteniendo los valores de lambda extraídos de la columna especificada. \`\`\` Este enfoque te da flexibilidad para especificar en qué columna se encuentra el valor de lambda al importar cada tabla. De esta manera, puedes ajustar dinámicamente tus importaciones basadas en la estructura específica de cada hoja de cálculo de Excel. **Nota Importante**: En el código de arriba, \`lambda_col\` se espera que sea un índice de columna basado en cero (es decir, \`0\` para la primera columna, \`1\` para la segunda, etc.). Esto se alinea con la forma en que pandas indexa las columnas de un DataFrame. El argumento \`lambda_col\` es opcional y solo se usa si deseas extraer específicamente valores de lambda y potencialmente moverlos a su propia columna dentro del DataFrame. Adapta el manejo del DataFrame resultante según tus necesidades específicas, especialmente si decides eliminar o no la columna original después de extraer los valores de lambda."},{"prompt":"هل انت النمذج الرابع","completion":"لا، أنا مجرد نموذج لغة طورته OpenAI. إذا كانت لديك أي أسئلة أو إذا كنت بحاجة إلى مساعدة في موضوع معين، فأنا هنا للمساعدة!"},{"prompt":"continue this: The exploration into the dynamics of momentum investing strategies, particularly in relation to price synchronicity, information asymmetry, and investor sentiment, opens numerous avenues for future research. Four main directions that could be particularly fruitful for expanding our understanding are: # 1. Investigating the Role of Macro-economic Factors Future studies could delve deeper into how broader macro-economic factors (like interest rates, inflation, GDP growth rates, etc.) interact with investor sentiment and price synchronicity to influence momentum strategies. Understanding these relationships could provide a more comprehensive view of the conditions under which momentum investing is most effective, potentially leading to the development of models that incorporate economic indicators to predict momentum returns more accurately. # 2. Sector-specific Momentum Analysis Another promising direction is conducting sector-specific analyses to determine if certain industries or sectors exhibit stronger momentum effects due to higher price synchronicity or different levels of information asymmetry. For instance, technology stocks might behave differently from utility stocks in terms of price movements and investor reactions to news. Understanding these sector-specific dynamics could aid investors in refining their momentum strategies to capitalize on industry-specific trends. # 3. Comparative Studies Across Different","completion":"Markets A significant expansion of current research could be comparative studies across different geographical markets or between developed and emerging markets. These studies can explore how momentum investing strategies perform in different market conditions, considering variables such as market maturity, legal and regulatory frameworks, and the overall level of market efficiency. Such research could uncover unique momentum dynamics in differing markets, providing insights into how global investors might adjust their strategies to accommodate regional differences. # 4. The Impact of Technological Advancements With the rapid pace of technological advancements, there is a pressing need to understand how new technologies, like machine learning algorithms, big data analytics, and blockchain, are influencing momentum investing strategies. These technologies have the potential to significantly reduce information asymmetry and alter price synchronicity through faster dissemination of information and more efficient transaction methods. Investigating the effects of these technologies could uncover new strategies for leveraging momentum investing in a high-tech financial landscape. Additionally, this exploration might reveal the need for regulatory adjustments or the development of new tools to aid investors in navigating this evolved market. Exploring these four areas could greatly enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive momentum investing and how it can be optimized in different contexts. This deeper insight could lead to more robust investment strategies, better risk management practices, and potentially higher returns for investors willing to explore these dynamics."},{"prompt":"give a brief introduction to discussion and conclusion chapter","completion":"# Introduction to Discussion and Conclusion Chapter The discussion and conclusion chapter of a research project marks the culmination of the investigative journey, offering a platform to consolidate and synthesize the findings, interpret their significance, and contemplate the broader implications of the study within the realm of existing literature and potential future research avenues.

However, in your case, both running times and altitudes are continuous data. Chi-square tests are typically used for categorical data (like gender, race, or yes/no responses), not continuous data. Nonetheless, it’s possible to adapt your continuous data into a form that's suitable for a chi-square test by categorizing it. Here’s a simplified approach to how you might proceed: # 1. Categorize Your Data First, you need to convert your continuous variables (running times and altitudes) into categorical variables. **Altitudes:** You may categorize altitudes into low, medium, and high elevation categories. The specific ranges for these categories depend on the altitudes of your colleges. For example, 0-1000 meters could be \\"low,\\" 1001-2000 meters \\"medium,\\" and 2001 meters and above \\"high.\\" **Running Times:** You could categorize these based on performance: \\"fast,\\" \\"moderate,\\" and \\"slow.\\" The categorization criteria depend on the times you have. As an illustration, you might consider times under a certain threshold as \\"fast,\\" times a bit slower than that as \\"moderate,\\" and the rest as \\"slow.\\" # 2. Create a Contingency Table Now, create a contingency table with your categorized data, showing the frequency of observations (e.g., number of schools) in each category combination. | Altitude Time | Fast | Moderate | Slow | **Total** | |-----------------|------|----------|------|-----------| | **Low** | A | B | C | A+B+C | | **Medium** | D | E | F | D+E+F | | **High** | G | H | I | G+H+I | | **Total** | A+D+G | B+E+H | C+F+I| N | # 3. Calculate Expected Frequencies Use the totals in your table to calculate expected frequencies for each cell. The expected frequency for a cell in a contingency table is calculated by multiplying the row total and column total, then dividing by the grand total (N). # 4. Apply the Chi-Square Formula The chi-square statistic ((chi^2)) is calculated using the formula: [ chi^2 = sum left(frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}right) ] Where: - (O_i) = Observed frequency (your actual count in each category) - (E_i) = Expected frequency (calculated in the previous step) - The summation ((sum)) symbol means you sum this calculation for all categories. # 5. Determine the Statistical Significance Once you've calculated your chi-square statistic, compare it to a critical value from a chi-square distribution table. You'll need to know your degrees of freedom, which for a contingency table is ((text{number of rows - 1}) times (text{number of columns - 1})). If your chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value, you can reject the null hypothesis; in this context, it would suggest a significant association between altitude and running time categories. However, remember that adapting this test for continuous data through categorization can lead to loss of information and power. It might be more appropriate to use a method designed for continuous data, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient for linear relationships, or a regression analysis to explore how altitude could predict running times, acknowledging that both involve assumptions that should be verified."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, both running times and altitudes are continuous data. Consequently, the Chi-square test isn't the most direct or appropriate method to assess the correlation or relationship between these variables. For continuous data, correlation coefficients like Pearson's or Spearman's rho are generally more suitable. Yet, if you're determined to use a Chi-square approach, one way to do it would be to categorize both the running times and the altitudes. Here's a basic step-by-step guide on how you might proceed, keeping in mind this method involves turning your continuous data into categorical, which can result in loss of information: # Steps to Categorize Data and Use the Chi-square Test 1. Categorize Your Data - **Running Times**: Divide the running times into categories. For example, \\"Fast\\", \\"Moderate\\", and \\"Slow\\", based on time ranges that make sense based on the data distribution. - **Altitudes**: Similarly, categorize the colleges' altitudes. For instance, \\"Low Altitude\\", \\"Medium Altitude\\", and \\"High Altitude\\". 2. Create a Contingency Table Arrange your categorized data into a contingency table. Each cell in the table will represent the count of occurrences for each category combination. For instance, the count of top 50 times classified as \\"Fast\\" at \\"High Altitude\\". 3. Apply the Chi-square Test The basic formula for Chi-square is: [ chi^2 = sum left( frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} right) ] Where: - (O_i) = Observed frequency in each category - (E_i) = Expected frequency if there was no association (calculated based on margins of the contingency table) You would calculate this for each cell of your contingency table and sum those values to get the Chi-square statistic. 4. Determine Significance Compare the computed Chi-square statistic against the critical value from the Chi-square distribution table for your chosen significance level (( alpha ), often 0.05) and degrees of freedom (df). Degrees of freedom for a contingency table are calculated as ( (r - 1)(c - 1) ), where ( r ) is the number of rows and ( c ) is the number of columns in the table. If your Chi-square statistic exceeds the critical value, you may reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is a significant association between the categories of running times and altitude. Caveats 1. **Data Loss**: Converting continuous data into categories can lead to a significant loss of information and may not accurately reflect the true nature of the relationship between variables. 2. **Assumption of Independence**: The Chi-square test assumes that each observation is independent. Ensure this assumption is valid for your dataset. 3. **Expected Frequencies**: Each category should ideally have an expected frequency of 5 or more to meet the assumptions of the Chi-square test. 4. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Even if a significant association is found, it does not imply causation between the variables. # Alternative Approach Given the continuous nature of both variables (running times and altitudes), a better approach might be to use correlation coefficients or regression analysis. Specifically, calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient would provide a measure of the linear correlation between running times and altitudes, assuming both distributions approximately follow a normal distribution. For non-linear relationships or non-normally distributed data, Spearman's rho could be a better choice."},{"prompt":"How i can use the chi square formula to find a correlation between the top 50 cross country running times and the college’s altitudes","completion":"To determine whether there is a correlation between the top 50 cross-country running times and the colleges' altitudes using the chi-square ((chi^2)) formula, you can follow a series of steps to organize the data, calculate the expected frequencies, and then apply the (chi^2) formula. The fundamental idea here is to see if the distribution of running times is dependent (or independent) of the altitudes of colleges. However, since chi-square is typically used for categorical data, you will first need to categorize your continuous data (running times and altitudes). # Step 1: Categorize Your Data - **For Running Times**: Divide the running times into categories, such as \\"fast,\\" \\"average,\\" and \\"slow,\\" based on criteria you define (for instance, considering specific time ranges). - **For Altitudes**: Similarly, categorize the colleges' altitudes into \\"low,\\" \\"medium,\\" and \\"high\\" elevation ranges. # Step 2: Create a Contingency Table Make a contingency table that counts how many times fall into each category combination. Your table might look something like this: | Altitude Running Time | Fast | Average | Slow | |-------------------------|------|---------|------| | Low | | | | | Medium | | | | | High | | | | Fill in each cell with the count of times from colleges at each altitude category. # Step 3: Calculate Expected Frequencies For each cell in your contingency table, calculate the expected frequency, which is what you would expect if there were no correlation between altitude and running time. The formula is: [E_{ij} = frac{(Row Total) cdot (Column Total)}{Grand Total}] # Step 4: Apply the Chi-Square Formula Now, apply the chi-square formula: [chi^2 = sumleft(frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}right)] where (O_{ij}) is the observed frequency in each cell, and (E_{ij}) is the expected frequency. # Step 5: Determine Significance After calculating the (chi^2) value, determine if it is significant. This involves comparing your calculated value to a critical value from a (chi^2) distribution table, which depends on your desired confidence level (often 95%) and the degrees of freedom (df). The df can be calculated as: [df = (number of rows - 1) cdot (number of columns - 1)] If your calculated (chi^2) is greater than the critical value from the table, you can reject the null hypothesis (which states there is no correlation between running times and altitudes) and conclude there is a statistically significant correlation between the variables. # Limitations and Considerations Remember, chi-square tests for independence rather than correlation per se, that is, whether two categorical variables are related or not, rather than how they move together. Additionally, because you're working with categorized data instead of the original continuous data, some information is lost in the process which might affect the sensitivity of your analysis. For continuous data like running times and altitudes, a correlation coefficient (like Pearson's r) or a regression analysis might provide more direct insight into how these variables relate. However, categorizing the data and using a chi-square test as outlined can still offer valuable preliminary insights, especially for non-linear relationships or when your data doesn’t meet the assumptions required for parametric tests."},{"prompt":"How i can use the chi square formula to find a correlation between the top 50 cross country running times and the college’s altitudes","completion":"To use the chi-square formula to find a correlation between the top 50 cross country running times and the college's altitudes, you would first need to collect the relevant data. 1. Record the top 50 cross country running times from a specific race or competition. 2. Record the altitudes of the colleges where the top runners train or compete. 3. Create a contingency table with the data, categorizing altitudes into different groups if necessary. 4. Calculate the expected frequencies for each cell in the contingency table. This can be done by multiplying the row total by the column total and dividing by the overall total. 5. Calculate the chi-square value by summing the squared differences between the observed and expected frequencies, divided by the expected frequency for each cell. 6. Determine the degrees of freedom for the chi-square test (degrees of freedom = (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1)). 7. Compare the calculated chi-square value to a critical value from a chi-square distribution table. If the calculated value is greater than the critical value, there is a significant correlation between cross country running times and altitudes. It is important to note that while the chi-square test can show a significant relationship between variables, it does not indicate the strength or direction of the correlation. Additional statistical analysis may be needed to further examine the relationship between cross country running times and altitudes."},{"prompt":"You are going to take an exam for a biology professor and answer his questions.

Typically, the Chi-square test is used for categorical data to test the independence between two variables. In your case, you're dealing with two continuous variables: running times and altitudes. However, to analyze the relationship between running times and altitudes, there are more appropriate statistical methods. Here's how you might proceed with an analysis that aligns more closely with the nature of your data: 1. **Data Collection**: Ensure your data on the top 50 cross-country running times and the corresponding colleges’ altitudes are correctly collected in two columns, one for each variable. 2. **Data Classification (if forcing a Chi-square application)**: If you still intend to proceed with a Chi-square for illustrative purposes or due to specific constraints, classify the continuous data into categories. For example, altitudes could be categorized into low, medium, and high, while running times could be split into fast, average, and slow. - **Altitude Categories (example)**: Low (0-500m), Medium (501-1500m), High (1501m+). - **Running Times Categories (example)**: Fast (times faster than a certain percentile), Average (times around the median), Slow (times slower than a certain percentile). 3. **Contingency Table**: Create a contingency table (also known as a cross-tabulation or crosstab) listing how many observations fall into each category for the combinations of the two variables. 4. **Perform Chi-square Test**: Now, if you've categorically divided your variables, you can apply the Chi-square test. The formula for the Chi-square ((chi^2)) statistic is: [ chi^2 = sum frac{(O - E)^2}{E} ] Where: - (O) stands for the observed frequency in each category. - (E) is the expected frequency under the null hypothesis, calculated by ((text{Row total}*text{Column total})/text{Total observations}). You'd calculate this for each cell in your contingency table and sum it up to get the Chi-square statistic. 5. **Interpretation**: Use the calculated Chi-square statistic and degrees of freedom (df) to determine the p-value from a Chi-square distribution table. The degrees of freedom are calculated as ((text{number of altitude categories} - 1) * (text{number of running time categories} - 1)). If your p-value is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis that there's no association between the two categorical variables. **More Appropriate Methods**: For continuous data like yours, correlation analysis (e.g., Pearson or Spearman correlation) or regression analysis would be more appropriate methods to assess the relationship directly without categorizing the variables. These methods can offer a clearer understanding of how running times might vary with altitude. To conclude, while the Chi-square test is not directly applicable to your original query without categorizing your continuous data, understanding the appropriate statistical methods to apply in specific contexts is crucial for accurate and meaningful data analysis."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!
