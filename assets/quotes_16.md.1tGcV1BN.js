However, here are some factors that could be taken into account for such a move: **Content Acquisition and Licensing:** Netflix could be interested in acquiring WWE Raw to diversify its content catalog and appeal to a broader audience, including sports entertainment fans. The licensing agreement would need to be lucrative for both parties, balancing Netflix's content budget with WWE's revenue expectations. **Subscription Growth:** If Netflix is experiencing stagnation or a decline in subscriber growth, adding WWE Raw to its lineup could potentially attract new subscribers or retain the current ones who are wrestling fans. **Market Competition:** The streaming market is highly competitive, with several platforms such as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, and new entrants offering diverse content. Exclusive sports entertainment content could give Netflix an edge over competitors. **WWE's Distribution Strategy:** WWE would assess the financial implications of moving Raw to Netflix. This would include considering their current contracts, the platform's reach, and the potential impact on their direct-to-consumer service, WWE Network. WWE might not want to limit their flagship show's availability to only one platform if it could potentially decrease their overall audience and revenue. **Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive Rights:** The deal would depend on whether Netflix is looking for exclusive rights to stream WWE Raw. Exclusive rights could be more expensive and riskier for Netflix but could also ensure that fans subscribe to their service to access the content. **International Reach:** Netflix has a significant international subscriber base, which could benefit WWE in expanding their global audience. WWE would need to weigh this expansion against any existing international broadcasting agreements. **Live Streaming Capabilities:** Historically, Netflix has not focused on live streaming content, as their platform has been oriented towards on-demand viewing. Incorporating live content like WWE Raw would require Netflix to adapt its infrastructure and possibly change its content delivery model. **Fan Engagement:** WWE events are known for their live interactions and immediate audience feedback, something that could potentially be less engaging on a streaming platform versus traditional live TV or pay-per-view broadcasts. **Contractual Agreements:** WWE's contract with TV networks such as USA Network would play a crucial role. If they have a long-term deal in place, moving to Netflix might not be possible until the contract expires or is renegotiated. In conclusion, while there could be potential benefits and opportunities, there are also significant challenges and considerations associated with a decision for WWE Raw to move to Netflix. Stakeholders would need to evaluate many strategic, financial, and technical aspects before such a fundamental shift in distribution could occur."},{"prompt":"Analyze the prospects of WWE Raw moving to the Weather Channel.","completion":"Moving WWE Raw to the Weather Channel would be an unlikely and unusual decision, given the vast differences in both content and audience between the two. WWE Raw is a flagship professional wrestling program that features scripted matches, storylines, and character development, typically appealing to sports entertainment fans. The Weather Channel, on the other hand, focuses on weather forecasts, news, and related documentaries, serving an audience interested in meteorology and climate information. Here's an analysis of the prospects and implications of such a move: **Content Mismatch:** The content of WWE Raw is vastly different from what viewers expect on The Weather Channel. A move like this would disrupt the brand consistency of The Weather Channel and could lead to audience confusion and dissatisfaction. **Audience Disruption:** WWE Raw fans are accustomed to finding the show on sports or entertainment-focused networks. Shifting to The Weather Channel could result in a significant drop in viewership as fans might not follow the program to an unrelated network. **Ratings and Revenue Impact:** WWE programming typically draws a sizable audience, which translates into advertising revenue. The Weather Channel might not be able to capitalize on this due to a potential mismatch in the target demographic for advertisers. **Brand Identity Risks:** The Weather Channel has established itself as a trusted source for weather information. Hosting a sports entertainment show could dilute its brand identity and expertise in the field of weather broadcasting. **Distribution Agreements:** Both WWE Raw and The Weather Channel have existing contracts and distribution agreements with various cable and satellite providers. Any move would involve complex renegotiations and could have legal and financial implications. **Promotional Challenges:** Promoting WWE Raw within The Weather Channel's usual content could be challenging. The integration of wrestling promotions amidst weather forecasts and analysis would likely be disjointed and possibly ineffective. **Strategic Advantage:** It's difficult to discern any strategic advantage for either WWE Raw or The Weather Channel in such a move. Both entities are better served by networks and platforms that align with their core content and target audiences. In conclusion, it seems highly improbable that WWE Raw would move to The Weather Channel. Both WWE and The Weather Channel have cultivated specific audiences and specialized in different types of content delivered through tailored platforms. A partnership or move of this nature would likely not benefit either entity and could potentially harm both their reputations and business models. It's more viable for WWE Raw to remain on sports or entertainment-focused networks that complement its content and audience."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

Here is this prompt and a sample of my students writing. Tell me as a teacher if this sample meets the requirements and give them a score based on the rubric.: Prompt: In 1930 Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi led a nonviolent march in India protesting Britain’s colonial monopoly on and taxation of an essential resource: salt. The Salt March, as it came to be known, was a triggering moment for the larger civil disobedience movement that eventually won India independence from Britain in 1947. Shortly before the Salt March, Gandhi had written to Viceroy Lord Irwin, the representative of the British crown in India. The passage below is the conclusion of that letter. Read the passage carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze the rhetorical choices Gandhi makes to present his case to Lord Irwin. I know that in embarking on non-violence, I shall be running what might fairly be termed a mad risk. But the victories of truth have never been won L without risks, often of the gravest character. ine 5 Conversion of a nation that has consciously or unconsciously preyed upon another, far more numerous, far more ancient, and no less cultured than itself, is worth any amount of risk. I have deliberately used the word conversion. For 10 my ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence, and thus to make them see the wrong they have done to India. I do not seek to harm your people. I want to serve them even as I want to serve my own. I believe that I have always 15 served them. I served them up to 1919, blindly. But when my eyes were opened and I conceived non-co-operation, the object still was to serve them. I employed the same weapon that I have, in all humility, successfully 20 used against the dearest members of my family. If I have equal love for your people with mine, it will not long remain hidden. It will be acknowledged by them, even as the members of my family acknowledged, after they had tried me for several years. If the people 25 join me, as I expect they will, the sufferings they will undergo, unless the British nation sooner retraces its steps, will be enough to melt the stoniest hearts. The plan through civil disobedience will be to combat such evils as I have sampled out. If we want 30 to sever the British connection it is because of such evils. When they are removed, the path becomes easy. Then the way to friendly negotiation will be open. If the British commerce with India is purified of greed, you will have no difficulty in recognizing our 35 independence. I invite you then to pave the way for immediate removal of those evils, and thus open a way for a real conference between equals, interested only in promoting the common good of mankind through voluntary fellowship and in arranging terms 40 of mutual help and commerce equally suited to both. You have unnecessarily laid stress upon communal problems that unhappily affect this land. Important though they undoubtedly are for the consideration of any scheme of Government they have little bearing 45 on the greater problems which are above communities and which affect them all equally. But if you cannot see your way to deal with these evils and my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month, I shall proceed with such co-workers of 50 the Ashram1 as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the salt laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man’s standpoint. As the independence movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with 55 this evil. The wonder is that we have submitted to the cruel monopoly for so long. It is, I know, open to you to frustrate my design by arresting me. I hope that there will be tens of thousands ready, in a disciplined manner, to take up the work after me, and, in the act 60 of disobeying the Salt Act2, to lay themselves open to the penalties of a law that should never have disfigured the statute book. I have no desire to cause you unnecessary embarrassment, or any at all, so far as I can help. If 65 you think that there is any substance in my letter, and if you will care to discuss matters with me, and if to that end you would like me to postpone publication of this letter, I shall gladly refrain on receipt of a telegram to that effect soon after this reaches you. 70 You will, however, do me the favour not to deflect me from my course, unless you can see your way to conform to the substance of this letter. This letter is not in any way intended as a threat, but is a simple and sacred duty, peremptory on a civil 75 resister. Therefore, I am having it specially delivered by a young English friend who believes in the Indian cause and is a full believer in non-violence and whom Providence seems to have sent to me, as it were, for the very purpose. 1 A spiritual retreat or monastery for a community of Hindus 2 The India Salt Act (1882) enforced the British colonial government’s monopoly on the collection, manufacture, and sale of salt in India. Requirements: 1 point Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices. Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons. The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity. • The thesis may be anywhere within the response. • For a thesis to be defensible, the passage must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point. • The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point. • A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning. My Student's Sample : In 1930, Britain still had immense control over India and profited greatly over their many resources. One of them most popularly being salt. The British rule of India taxed its native citizens on salt and other goods, soon beginning a ripple effect of impactful yet nonviolent protests that soon led to India’s independence in 1947. The first of many protests began with the Salt March, led by none other than Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi. Prior to the Salt March occuring, Gandhi wrote to the representative of the British crown in India (Viceroy Lord Irwin) in hopes of persuading the British government in consensually giving India its independence and allowing them to have control over the resources that were rightfully theirs. He attempts to achieve this purpose by establishing his respect for the nation of Britain and its people, assuring Britain it’s benefits over India’s independence and giving a subtle yet firm warning to the British government. Gandhi intelligently begins and even ends his letter immediately and clearly stating his criticism towards the British rule over India has absolutely no violent or ill intentions. He acknowledges the fact that it could be considered risky to ask for indepence in a peaceful manner but is worth said risk if it can possibly build a strong relationship between two countries “no less cultured” than the other. After establishing India’s respect as a nation for Britain as a whole, he expresses his personal feelings of admiration towards Britain and his desire to serve it as he always has, “I do not seek to harm your people. I want to serve them even as I want to serve my own. I believe that I have always served them.” To further build on that emotional connection, Gandhi goes as far to compare the love he has with Britain to the love he has for his own people or his “family” whomst he countinted to loyally serve even after hearing of the flaws in the monarchy’s rule of India. Despite the tense relationship between the two nations Gandhi makes it clear he still views Britain as a respectable ally he adores and has no intention to revolt against whilst building an emotional and personal connection between him and Lord Irwin who was born on British soil. Gandhi was aware that compliments and flattery towards Britain in itself was not enough to convince them India was worthy of its independence, therefore he lays out his thoughts on how he believes that Britain would continue to benefit greatly from resources even with India’s newly established independence and both parties will receive what they want. Once Britain's “evil” forces are removed from India, the nation will be able to fairly distribute resources among both countries, “When they are removed, the path becomes easy. Then the way to friendly negotiation is open.” Gandhi slightly infers that if British forces cooperate with India as equals, they will gain the resources they desire easily without having to fight the resistance and rightful anger of India’s people. By presenting the idea to the British government of an easier and peaceful way to obtain resources from India, he ultimately portrays India’s independence as something it was assumed to be the opposite of: a win to Britain. Regardless of his soft demeanor towards Britain in his letter, Gandhi was not afraid to show his eagerness in granting India its independence by subtly heeding Britain multiple warnings on what is to come if they fail to give India what it desires. He first inverses his previous argument by discussing that Britain will fail to thrive in India if the nation is still under British rule, it will be harder for them to stay in power as anger within India and its people will continue to rise after years of unjustful treatment. He acknowledges that the wrath of the citizens of India is not to be taken lightly, although he does not intend violence or harm towards Britain his words imply a powerful and fearful tone, “If the people join me, as I expect they will, the sufferings they will undergo, unless the British nation sooner retraces it’s steps, will be enough to melt the stoniest hearts.” He lastly adds that even if Britain gives India its independence yet does not end its “greedy” treatment, India will not hesitate to let Britain be aware of its newly born nation that has total control over its own land. Gandhi swiftly shows a serious side to him to assure his point gets across to Britain and is not mistaken as pleading for indepence, but rather respectfully demanding it. Gandhi seems to achieve his purpose of negotiating the independence of India by establishing his respect for the nation of Britain and its people, assuring Britain its benefits over India’s independence and giving a subtle yet firm warning to the British government. Although India's independence was not granted directly after this letter was read, it’s promises were fulfilled and India soon got it wanted very soon after with the help of Gandhi's powerful words and actions.","completion":"Assessing the student's essay response to the prompt regarding Mahatma Gandhi's rhetorical choices in his letter to Lord Irwin, we can use the provided criteria to guide the scoring. 1. **Defensible Thesis** (0-1 point) The student's thesis statement asserts that Gandhi aims to negotiate India's independence by establishing respect for Britain, assuring mutual benefits, and subtly warning the British government. While the thesis could be more precise in specifying the rhetorical choices Gandhi employs (such as emotional appeals, ethical arguments, or logical reasoning), it does meet the basic requirements of responding to the prompt with a defensible position that is more than just a restatement of the prompt. Therefore, we can award 1 point for the thesis. 2. **Evidence and Commentary** (0-4 points) Based on the rubric's typical scoring for evidence and commentary: - The essay mentions Gandhi’s emotional appeal by highlighting his respect and service to Britain and his nonviolent approach. - There's a discussion of the logical argument Gandhi poses regarding the mutual benefits of India's independence for Britain. - The student identifies Gandhi's warning as a strategic use of a subtle threat (or caution) without resorting to an actual threat, which shows an understanding of Gandhi's tone and purpose. Given that the student's essay provides relevant evidence and commentary that show a grasp of the rhetorical strategies used by Gandhi, we can award points based on the level of sophistication and depth of analysis. Considering that the student does an acceptable job of explaining how these strategies function, we could award 3 points out of 4, with one point potentially deducted for not fully explaining how the evidence supports the thesis throughout and for missing potential analysis of the rhetorical impact of particular word choices or phrases in the text. 3. **Sophistication of Thought** (0-1 point) The sophistication point is typically awarded for essays that demonstrate a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation, use of nuanced language, and an effective connection of ideas. The student's essay shows a basic understanding of the rhetorical situation but could enhance the sophistication with more nuanced language and a deeper exploration of the rhetorical impact on different audiences. Considering this, the sophistication point is not awarded. 4. **Organization** (0-1 point) The student’s essay is organized with an introduction that includes a thesis, body paragraphs that discuss different rhetorical strategies, and a conclusion that reiterates the thesis and the success of Gandhi's efforts. Thus the essay is organized effectively for the most part, awarding 1 organization point. **Final Assessment:** - **Defensible Thesis:** 1 point - **Evidence and Commentary:** 3 points - **Sophistication of Thought:** 0 points - **Organization:** 1 point **Total Score: 5 out of 7 points** The student's essay responds effectively to the prompt and demonstrates a good understanding of Gandhi's rhetorical approach. For further improvement, the student could delve more into the specifics of Gandhi’s word choice and the nuances in his arguments to further justify the thesis with richer evidence and analysis, possibly obtaining a higher score for evidence and commentary, and adding complexity to the essay's thought process for a chance at earning the sophistication point."},{"prompt":"Según sowell, el socialismo puede ser no autoritario?","completion":"Thomas Sowell es un economista estadounidense conocido por sus opiniones políticas conservadoras y liberales clásicas. Sowell ha sido un crítico del socialismo, argumentando que en la práctica a menudo conduce a resultados negativos y que la planificación centralizada no es tan eficiente ni beneficiosa como las fuerzas del mercado libre. Según Sowell, el socialismo tiende a requerir un grado de autoridad y coerción por parte del estado para implementar y mantener sus políticas, debido a la necesidad de controlar la economía y restringir ciertas libertades individuales para alcanzar sus fines igualitarios. En el entendimiento de Sowell, el socialismo autoritario es aquel que se identifica con regímenes que ejercen control total o significativo sobre la vida política y económica, como la Unión Soviética o la Cuba de Fidel Castro. Estos sistemas son a menudo criticados por su opresión política y falta de libertades individuales. No obstante, cabe mencionar que algunos defensores del socialismo argumentan que existen o podrían existir variantes del socialismo que son democráticas y no autoritarias, conocidas como socialismo democrático. Este enfoque pretende combinar los derechos políticos y civiles de una democracia liberal con una economía orientada hacia la igualdad social y económica, manteniendo algunas características del mercado y propiedad privada, junto con una fuerte regulación estatal y una amplia red de seguridad social. Sowell probablemente sería escéptico ante la idea de que el socialismo puede ser totalmente no autoritario, ya que considera que las políticas socialistas tienden a restringir la libertad económica y, en última instancia, pueden llevar a una mayor autoridad estatal. No obstante, la valoración de si el socialismo puede ser no autoritario o no depende en gran medida de la definición de socialismo que se emplee y cómo se implemente en la práctica."},{"prompt":"Входной контроль (Литература) • Биография А.Н.

Here is this prompt and a sample of my students writing. Tell me as a teacher if this sample meets the requirements and give them a score based on the rubric.: Prompt: In 1930 Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi led a nonviolent march in India protesting Britain’s colonial monopoly on and taxation of an essential resource: salt. The Salt March, as it came to be known, was a triggering moment for the larger civil disobedience movement that eventually won India independence from Britain in 1947. Shortly before the Salt March, Gandhi had written to Viceroy Lord Irwin, the representative of the British crown in India. The passage below is the conclusion of that letter. Read the passage carefully. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze the rhetorical choices Gandhi makes to present his case to Lord Irwin. I know that in embarking on non-violence, I shall be running what might fairly be termed a mad risk. But the victories of truth have never been won L without risks, often of the gravest character. ine 5 Conversion of a nation that has consciously or unconsciously preyed upon another, far more numerous, far more ancient, and no less cultured than itself, is worth any amount of risk. I have deliberately used the word conversion. For 10 my ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence, and thus to make them see the wrong they have done to India. I do not seek to harm your people. I want to serve them even as I want to serve my own. I believe that I have always 15 served them. I served them up to 1919, blindly. But when my eyes were opened and I conceived non-co-operation, the object still was to serve them. I employed the same weapon that I have, in all humility, successfully 20 used against the dearest members of my family. If I have equal love for your people with mine, it will not long remain hidden. It will be acknowledged by them, even as the members of my family acknowledged, after they had tried me for several years. If the people 25 join me, as I expect they will, the sufferings they will undergo, unless the British nation sooner retraces its steps, will be enough to melt the stoniest hearts. The plan through civil disobedience will be to combat such evils as I have sampled out. If we want 30 to sever the British connection it is because of such evils. When they are removed, the path becomes easy. Then the way to friendly negotiation will be open. If the British commerce with India is purified of greed, you will have no difficulty in recognizing our 35 independence. I invite you then to pave the way for immediate removal of those evils, and thus open a way for a real conference between equals, interested only in promoting the common good of mankind through voluntary fellowship and in arranging terms 40 of mutual help and commerce equally suited to both. You have unnecessarily laid stress upon communal problems that unhappily affect this land. Important though they undoubtedly are for the consideration of any scheme of Government they have little bearing 45 on the greater problems which are above communities and which affect them all equally. But if you cannot see your way to deal with these evils and my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month, I shall proceed with such co-workers of 50 the Ashram1 as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the salt laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man’s standpoint. As the independence movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with 55 this evil. The wonder is that we have submitted to the cruel monopoly for so long. It is, I know, open to you to frustrate my design by arresting me. I hope that there will be tens of thousands ready, in a disciplined manner, to take up the work after me, and, in the act 60 of disobeying the Salt Act2, to lay themselves open to the penalties of a law that should never have disfigured the statute book. I have no desire to cause you unnecessary embarrassment, or any at all, so far as I can help. If 65 you think that there is any substance in my letter, and if you will care to discuss matters with me, and if to that end you would like me to postpone publication of this letter, I shall gladly refrain on receipt of a telegram to that effect soon after this reaches you. 70 You will, however, do me the favour not to deflect me from my course, unless you can see your way to conform to the substance of this letter. This letter is not in any way intended as a threat, but is a simple and sacred duty, peremptory on a civil 75 resister. Therefore, I am having it specially delivered by a young English friend who believes in the Indian cause and is a full believer in non-violence and whom Providence seems to have sent to me, as it were, for the very purpose. 1 A spiritual retreat or monastery for a community of Hindus 2 The India Salt Act (1882) enforced the British colonial government’s monopoly on the collection, manufacture, and sale of salt in India. Requirements: 1 point Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices.

Responses that earn this point may demonstrate sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation by doing any of the following: 1. Explaining the significance or relevance of the writer’s rhetorical choices (given the rhetorical situation). 2. Explaining a purpose or function of the passage’s complexities or tensions. 3. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive. My Student's Sample : In 1930, Britain still had immense control over India and profited greatly over their many resources. One of them most popularly being salt. The British rule of India taxed its native citizens on salt and other goods, soon beginning a ripple effect of impactful yet nonviolent protests that soon led to India’s independence in 1947. The first of many protests began with the Salt March, led by none other than Mohandas “Mahatma” Gandhi. Prior to the Salt March occuring, Gandhi wrote to the representative of the British crown in India (Viceroy Lord Irwin) in hopes of persuading the British government in consensually giving India its independence and allowing them to have control over the resources that were rightfully theirs. He attempts to achieve this purpose by establishing his respect for the nation of Britain and its people, assuring Britain it’s benefits over India’s independence and giving a subtle yet firm warning to the British government. Gandhi intelligently begins and even ends his letter immediately and clearly stating his criticism towards the British rule over India has absolutely no violent or ill intentions. He acknowledges the fact that it could be considered risky to ask for indepence in a peaceful manner but is worth said risk if it can possibly build a strong relationship between two countries “no less cultured” than the other. After establishing India’s respect as a nation for Britain as a whole, he expresses his personal feelings of admiration towards Britain and his desire to serve it as he always has, “I do not seek to harm your people. I want to serve them even as I want to serve my own. I believe that I have always served them.” To further build on that emotional connection, Gandhi goes as far to compare the love he has with Britain to the love he has for his own people or his “family” whomst he countinted to loyally serve even after hearing of the flaws in the monarchy’s rule of India. Despite the tense relationship between the two nations Gandhi makes it clear he still views Britain as a respectable ally he adores and has no intention to revolt against whilst building an emotional and personal connection between him and Lord Irwin who was born on British soil. Gandhi was aware that compliments and flattery towards Britain in itself was not enough to convince them India was worthy of its independence, therefore he lays out his thoughts on how he believes that Britain would continue to benefit greatly from resources even with India’s newly established independence and both parties will receive what they want. Once Britain's “evil” forces are removed from India, the nation will be able to fairly distribute resources among both countries, “When they are removed, the path becomes easy. Then the way to friendly negotiation is open.” Gandhi slightly infers that if British forces cooperate with India as equals, they will gain the resources they desire easily without having to fight the resistance and rightful anger of India’s people. By presenting the idea to the British government of an easier and peaceful way to obtain resources from India, he ultimately portrays India’s independence as something it was assumed to be the opposite of: a win to Britain. Regardless of his soft demeanor towards Britain in his letter, Gandhi was not afraid to show his eagerness in granting India its independence by subtly heeding Britain multiple warnings on what is to come if they fail to give India what it desires. He first inverses his previous argument by discussing that Britain will fail to thrive in India if the nation is still under British rule, it will be harder for them to stay in power as anger within India and its people will continue to rise after years of unjustful treatment. He acknowledges that the wrath of the citizens of India is not to be taken lightly, although he does not intend violence or harm towards Britain his words imply a powerful and fearful tone, “If the people join me, as I expect they will, the sufferings they will undergo, unless the British nation sooner retraces it’s steps, will be enough to melt the stoniest hearts.” He lastly adds that even if Britain gives India its independence yet does not end its “greedy” treatment, India will not hesitate to let Britain be aware of its newly born nation that has total control over its own land. Gandhi swiftly shows a serious side to him to assure his point gets across to Britain and is not mistaken as pleading for indepence, but rather respectfully demanding it. Gandhi seems to achieve his purpose of negotiating the independence of India by establishing his respect for the nation of Britain and its people, assuring Britain its benefits over India’s independence and giving a subtle yet firm warning to the British government. Although India's independence was not granted directly after this letter was read, it’s promises were fulfilled and India soon got it wanted very soon after with the help of Gandhi's powerful words and actions.","completion":"As a writing teacher evaluating this student's essay against the given rubric, here are my comments and scores: **1 point (Thesis):** The student responds to the prompt with a clear thesis that analyzes Gandhi's rhetorical choices. The student's thesis is \\"He attempts to achieve this purpose by establishing his respect for the nation of Britain and its people, assuring Britain it’s benefits over India’s independence and giving a subtle yet firm warning to the British government.\\" This sentence sets up the analysis for the rest of the essay. ***Score: 1/1*** **4 points (Evidence and Commentary):** The student offers specific evidence from the text to support their claims. They discuss Gandhi's strategic use of respect, assurance of mutual benefit, and subtle warnings. Commentary is present throughout the essay, linking the evidence to the thesis. However, the analysis could be deeper in explaining how each rhetorical choice specifically contributes to Gandhi’s argument. There is a minor emphasis on summary at times, rather than fully developed analysis. ***Score: 2-3/4*** This range accounts for the evidence and explanations that are present but could use further development. **1 point (Sophistication):** The student’s essay presents a basic understanding of Gandhi’s rhetorical strategies but does not show a high degree of sophistication in thought or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation. There is an effort to analyze rather than summarize, but the connections and significance of Gandhi's strategies could be elaborated upon for a more nuanced interpretation. ***Score: 0-1/1*** The student has room to develop a more nuanced and sophisticated analysis that could delve into how Gandhi's ethos, pathos, and logos appeal to Lord Irwin and reflect the larger historical context. Overall, this student's essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the prompt and the passage, with notable insights into Gandhi's strategic communication. However, there is room to push the analysis further to fully realize the potential of the student's thesis through more detailed and complex commentary. The student would benefit from less summarizing and more analysis concerning the significance of Gandhi’s rhetorical choices. The student can earn a score between **3/6 and 5/6**, depending on the interpretation of the depth of evidence and commentary integration. An exact score within this range would depend on the balance struck by the overall impression of the reader, weighing the sophistication and integration of evidence and commentary."},{"prompt":"Входной контроль (Литература) • Биография А.Н.

WWE Raw is one of WWE's flagship shows, alongside SmackDown, and has traditionally aired on cable television, having long-standing deals with networks such as USA Network and previously with other networks like Spike TV. When analyzing the prospects of a show like WWE Raw moving to a different platform, several factors would need to be considered: 1. Contracts and licensing: WWE often enters into multi-year agreements with television networks for the rights to broadcast their shows. The company would need to wait until the contract expiration or negotiate an early exit, subject to the terms of their deal, to move Raw to another platform. 2. Audience reach: WWE's success with Raw is partly due to the broad accessibility of cable television. Moving to a lesser-known platform could potentially reduce the show’s reach and impact viewership and advertising revenue unless Wrestling Central has similar or greater reach. 3. Platform capability: Wrestling Central would need the infrastructure to handle the live broadcasting requirements of WWE Raw, including providing a positive viewer experience in terms of video quality, stability, and interactive features that WWE fans expect. 4. Financial aspects: WWE would assess the financial implications of such a move. A new deal would have to be financially attractive to prompt WWE to shift from a proven and established platform. 5. Strategic alignment: WWE may consider a move if Wrestling Central aligns with their strategic goals, such as targeting a specific demographic or providing opportunities for additional content, such as behind-the-scenes footage or exclusive matches. 6. Brand impact: WWE would carefully consider how a move would impact the WWE and Raw brands. Longevity, reputation, and continuity are important to sports entertainment fans, so the company would not take such a decision lightly. 7. Fan reception: Fan reaction would play a critical role in such a move. Loss of viewership due to platform change could have severe implications for the show’s success and longevity. In the hypothetical situation where WWE Raw is considering such a move, in-depth analysis would be crucial, considering the above factors and the current media landscape. Any changes to the broadcasting of WWE Raw would be a significant event in the sports entertainment industry and would likely be accompanied by extensive media coverage and analysis. Ultimately, whether WWE Raw could move to a platform named Wrestling Central or any other new platform in the future would hinge on complex negotiations, strategic decisions, and the evolving media landscape."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"你好，我想从js中提取api路径，正则该怎么写呢","completion":"你可以使用正则表达式来提取API路径。以下是一个示例的正则表达式，用于从字符串中提取API路径： \`\`\`javascript const str = 'https://api.example.com/v1/users/12'; const regex = /(https?://[^/]+)(.*)/i; const matches = str.match(regex); if (matches && matches.length >= 3) { const baseUrl = matches[1]; const apiPath = matches[2]; console.log(\\"Base URL:\\", baseUrl); console.log(\\"API Path:\\", apiPath); } \`\`\` 上述正则表达式将字符串拆分为两个捕获组：第一个捕获组是协议和域名部分，第二个捕获组是API路径部分。通过使用\`match()\`方法，可以将匹配的结果存储在\`matches\`数组中。 注意，该示例仅适用于常规的URL格式，并且仅提取协议和域名以及路径部分。如果API路径的格式更复杂，你可能需要根据具体的要求进行修改正则表达式。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As of the last available information, WWE had ongoing deals with USA Network for Raw. Any move would likely occur after the conclusion of their existing contracts unless there’s an early termination clause or a buyout. 2. **Financial Incentives**: The decision to move a major program like WWE Raw would largely depend on the financial incentives offered by the new network. If the Wrestling ChaCha Network could outbid the current network in terms of rights fees, it could be a huge incentive for WWE to move. 3. **Audience Reach and Demographics**: The viewership reach of the Wrestling ChaCha Network would be a critical factor. WWE would likely prefer a network that has a wide reach and aligns with the demographic profile of its fanbase to ensure high viewership numbers. 4. **Creative Control and Presentation**: WWE may consider how much creative control and freedom they would have on the new network. The presentation of the brand and the program is crucial, and WWE would likely seek assurances that Raw would retain its production values and presentation style. 5. **Strategic Partnerships**: If the Wrestling ChaCha Network can offer strategic partnerships or cross-promotional opportunities that go beyond the scope of a traditional broadcaster, these could provide added value. 6. **Digital Distribution**: Consideration would need to be given to how the move might impact digital streaming rights and distribution. WWE has a significant presence on various digital platforms including their own WWE Network (which may be integrated with Peacock or another streaming service depending on the region). Compatibility and potential synergies with digital distribution would be a key point. 7. **Fan Reaction and Brand Loyalty**: WWE would need to consider fan reaction to such a move. Long-time viewers may have loyalty to the current network or specific routines for watching Raw. An abrupt change could risk alienating some viewers. 8. **Market Conditions**: The television and streaming landscape is rapidly evolving, and new players are emerging while others consolidate or redirect their focus. Market conditions at the time would influence the feasibility and attractiveness of such a move. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we’d need specific details about WWE’s strategic objectives, the stature and capabilities of the Wrestling ChaCha Network, viewer trends, contract specifics, and the broader media landscape at the time under consideration. The actual prospects of such a move would depend on these factors and the business context closer to the year 2025."},{"prompt":"What is the viewership reach of the Wrestling ChaCha Network as of your knowledge cutoff?","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there is no actual network named \\"Wrestling ChaCha Network,\\" and it could be a hypothetical or fictional entity used in your question for the sake of discussion.

However, it's crucial to note that using such services to bypass paywalls can raise ethical and legal concerns, as it may violate copyright laws and terms of service agreements. These archiving services do not typically disclose their methods due to the sensitive nature of the process and the potential for misuse. Still, we can speculate on some of the general techniques that might be employed to access and capture content behind paywalls: 1. User contribution: Some services may allow users to share their own captures of pages. A user with legitimate access to a paywalled article may submit a snapshot to the archive. 2. Bypassing via referrer: Some websites may grant access to their content if the traffic appears to come from a trusted site, such as a search engine or social media platform. An archive service could potentially mimic such referral traffic. 3. Agreements with publishers: In some cases, services might have direct agreements with content providers for archiving purposes. This could grant them special access to content for archival reasons. 4. Exploiting paywall weaknesses: In some instances, paywalls may not be robustly enforced on the technical level. Certain methods might successfully access content without actually paying, such as by disabling JavaScript, using a browser's \\"reader\\" mode, or accessing a cached version of the page before the paywall script loads. 5. Subscription access: The service might subscribe to sites with a paywall to ensure they can archive content legitimately. 6. Technical Workarounds: They may develop custom scripts or use browser automation tools that mirror legitimate user behavior to access and snapshot the content. It is worth repeating that attempting to access paywalled content without proper authorization can be illegal and is generally against the terms of service of most websites. Users should respect copyright laws and pay for content from publishers to support the creation of quality journalism and creative work. Archive.ph and similar archiving services aim to preserve web content for the sake of history, research, and retrieval in case the original content is altered or disappears. If you need to access paywalled content, the recommended and ethical approach is to subscribe to the content provider or find a legal way to access the material."},{"prompt":"Есть сервер Samba, есть панель Webmin для управления Samba.

Tell me as a teacher if this sample meets the requirements and give them a score based on the rubric.: Prompt: The following passage concludes an essay by Edward Abbey about Aravaipa Canyon in New Mexico. Read the passage carefully. Then write an essay in which you characterize Abbey’s attitudes toward nature and analyze how Abbey conveys these views. Once, years before, I had glimpsed a mountain lion in this canyon, following me through the twilight. It was the only mountain lion I had ever seen, so far, in the wild. I stopped, the big cat stopped, we peered at each other through the gloom. 5 Mutual curiosity: I felt more wonder than fear. After a minute, or perhaps it was five minutes, I made a move to turn. The lion leaped up into the rocks and melted away. We see no mountain lions this evening. Nor any of the local deer, either Sonoran whitetail or the desert mule deer, although the 10 little heart-shaped tracks of the former are apparent in the sand. Javelina, or peccary, too, reside in this area; piglike animals with tusks, oversized heads, and tapering bodies, they roam the slopes and gulches in family bands, living on roots, tubers, and innards of barrel cactus, on grubs, insects, and carrion. Omnivorous, like 15 us, and equally playful, if not so dangerous. Any desert canyon with permanent water, like Aravaipa, will be as full of life as it is beautiful. We stumble homeward over the stones and through the anklebone-chilling water. The winter day seems alarmingly 20 short; it is. We reach the mouth of the canyon and the old trail uphill to the roadhead in time to see the first stars come out. Barely in time. Nightfall is quick in this arid climate and the air feels already cold. But we have earned enough memories, stored 25 enough mental-emotional images in our heads, from one brief day in Aravaipa Canyon, to enrich the urban days to come. As Thoreau found a universe in the woods around Concord, any person whose senses are alive can make a world of any natural place, however limited it might seem, on this subtle planet of 30 ours. “The world is big but it is comprehensible,” says R. Buckminster Fuller. But it seems to me that the world is not nearly big enough and that any portion of its surface, left unpaved and alive, is infinitely rich in details and relationships, in wonder, 35 beauty, mystery, comprehensible only in part. The very existence of existence is itself suggestive of the unknown—not a problem but a mystery. We will never get to the end of it, never plumb the bottom of it, never know the whole of even so small and trivial and useless 40 and precious a place as Aravaipa. Therein lies our redemption. Requirements: 1 point Responds to the prompt with a defensible thesis that analyzes the writer’s rhetorical choices. Responds to the prompt rather than restate or rephrase the prompt, and the thesis clearly takes a position rather than just stating that there are pros/cons. 4 points EVIDENCE: Provides specific evidence to support all claims in a line of reasoning. AND COMMENTARY: Consistently explains how the evidence supports a line of reasoning. AND Explains how multiple rhetorical choices in the passage contribute to the writer’s argument, purpose, or message. Typical responses that earn 4 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific words and details from the passage to build an argument. • Organize and support an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims, each with adequate evidence that is clearly explained. • Explain how the writer’s use of rhetorical choices contributes to the student’s interpretation of the passage. Typical responses that earn 3 points: • Uniformly offer evidence to support claims. • Focus on the importance of specific words and details from the passage to build an argument. • Organize an argument as a line of reasoning composed of multiple supporting claims. • Commentary may fail to integrate some evidence or fail to support a key claim. Typical responses that earn 2 points: • Consist of a mix of specific evidence and broad generalities. • May contain some simplistic, inaccurate, or repetitive explanations that don’t strengthen the argument. • May make one point well but either do not make multiple supporting claims or do not adequately support more than one claim. • Do not explain the connections or progression between the student’s claims, so a line of reasoning is not clearly established. Typical responses that earn 1 point: • Tend to focus on summary or description of a passage rather than specific details or techniques. • Mention rhetorical choices with little or no explanation. Writing that suffers from grammatical and/or mechanical errors that interfere with communication cannot earn the fourth point in this row. • To earn the fourth point in this row, the response may observe multiple instances of the same rhetorical choice if each instance further contributes to the argument, purpose, or message of the passage. Response demonstrates sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation. 1. Explaining the significance or relevance of the writer’s rhetorical choices (given the rhetorical situation). 2. Explaining a purpose or function of the passage’s complexities or tensions. 3. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive. Sample Essay: Nature, according to some, can be something of high volatility. It is also that very nature, that according to some has unlimited beauty. It has been a topic viewed with many different angles and by many different people. One such person who has taken an angle on nature is Edward Abbey, publishing an essay on his visit to Aravaipa Canyon, New Mexico. In his essay, Abbey is in awe of nature, seen through his use of vivid imagery to show his passion for nature and his use of admiring diction to emphasize nature’s wonder. Abbey first establishes his passion for nature through vivid imagery. He begins after describing his run in with the mountain lion, saying, “We see no mountain lions this evening. Nor any of the local deer, either Sonoran whitetail or the desert mule deer, although the little heart-shaped tracks of the former are apparent in the sand. Javelina, or peccary…”. By describing even the smallest, most insignificant details like the deer tracks or the diet of peccaries, Abbey shows that he is well-read on many concepts of nature and the natural world. By doing so, Abbey demonstrates his motivation and passion to know concepts like deer tracks and peccary diets, motivation that if he didn’t have a passion for nature, would’ve been absent due to a subsequent laziness followed by lack of passion and these small details would’ve still been uncovered. Furthermore, Abbey’s passion for nature exhibits his awe for it, because without reverence and wonder for a certain concept, passion wouldn't follow. Abbey also uses admiring diction to emphasize nature’s wonder. One example of this is after he described the fauna of Aravaipa Canyon and after describing his experiences, he later states, “But we have earned enough memories, stored enough mental-emotional images in our heads, from one brief day in Aravaipa Canyon, to enrich the urban days to come. Abbey’s use of “earned” emphasizes that memories of nature are like money and has value that we have to strive for. By bringing forward the idea of nature’s high value, Abbey shows that nature is something not to be regarded as petty, but something that deserves awe, thus showing his awe towards nature. Furthermore, in the same quote, Abbey utilized the word “enrich”. By claiming nature as something that can make the boring concrete-jungle life better, Abbey thus portrays nature as a mood-booster with the word “enrich”, essentially portraying nature in a positive light. By doing this, Abbey’s view of nature is clear; he has an awe towards it for if he didn’t, he would’ve used words, including “invoke fear” or “possibly dangerous” and note words like “enrich”. Overall, Abbey shows his awe towards nature throughout his essay. He does so using admiring diction to emphasize nature’s wonder and also his vivid imagery to display his passion for such a concept.","completion":"As a writing teacher, let's assess the sample essay according to the provided rubric: 1. Thesis: The student responds to the prompt with a thesis that aims to analyze Abbey’s attitudes and the methods by which Abbey conveys these views, asserting that Abbey is in awe of nature and uses vivid imagery and admiring diction. The student’s thesis is defensible but could be more specific in terms of the rhetorical choices Abbey makes. Score: 0.5 point (Needs a clearer connection to Abbey's rhetorical choices.) 2. Evidence and Commentary: The student identifies two main rhetorical devices used by Abbey: vivid imagery and admiring diction. These points are supported by specific examples from the text, such as mentioning the “little heart-shaped tracks” and Abbey’s reflection on the memories earned from nature. The essay could improve by integrating more varied textual evidence and by offering deeper analysis on how each example furthers the author's overarching argument or message. While the student claims that Abbey’s passion for nature is evident through his attention to detail, more exploration is needed to satisfactorily explain how the evidence supports the student's line of reasoning. Score: 2 points (Some evidence is provided with explanations but lacks depth and variety.) 3. Complexity: The student demonstrates an understanding of the rhetorical situation by discussing Abbey's word choice and its significance. However, there is limited exploration of the complexities or tensions within the passage, and while the writing is clear, it would benefit from more varied sentence structure and more vivid language to mimic the persuasive style of Abbey’s prose. Score: 0.5 point (Some awareness of rhetorical significance is present, but the analysis lacks depth.) Considering the rubric, the student's essay would likely earn a score in the range of 3 out of 6 points. To improve the score, the student would need to refine the thesis to more directly address Abbey’s rhetorical strategies and how they convey his attitudes toward nature, provide more varied and specific evidence, offer deeper commentary explaining the relationship between the evidence and the thesis, and demonstrate a more sophisticated understanding of the rhetorical situation. Additionally, the essay should strive for a less summary-focused approach and more analytical depth regarding the implications of Abbey’s word choices and imagery. It would also benefit from closer proofreading to eliminate areas of awkward phrasing (e.g., \\"motivation that if he didn’t have a passion...\\")."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Pusysk has a mass of about 0.8 times that of our Sun, making it slightly smaller. It is classified as a main sequence star, similar to the Sun. One interesting feature of Pusysk is that it is known to have 11 planets in its orbit. These planets vary in size, composition, and distance from the star. Some of these worlds might be rocky, resembling rocky planets in our own solar system like Earth and Mars, whereas others could be gas giants akin to Jupiter or Saturn. The actual characteristics of these planets, such as their atmospheres, surface conditions, or potential habitability, would require further exploration and study. In terms of its overall appearance, Pusysk likely emits light similar to other stars, with its own unique spectral signature that can be observed and analyzed by astronomers. Its surface temperature, luminosity, and other properties would determine its color and brightness when observed from a distance. However, since Pusysk is a hypothetical star, based on the information given, its nature and specific details beyond its mass and number of planets cannot be determined."},{"prompt":"Describe Przybylski's Star","completion":"Przybylski's Star, also known as HD 101065 or CPD-69 211, is a peculiar chemically peculiar star located in the constellation Centaurus. It was named after Antoni Przybylski, a Polish-Australian astrophysicist who discovered its unusual properties. Przybylski's Star is classified as an A-type star and is approximately 355 light-years away from Earth. What makes it unique is its unusually high abundance of certain rare earth elements, as well as its low levels of other elements. These chemical peculiarities make it stand out among other stars in the galaxy. The star's surface temperature is around 7,500 Kelvin, which is quite hot compared to the Sun. Its strong magnetic field and slow rotation make the outer layers of the star rich in heavy elements, such as strontium and germanium. It also shows evidence of strong magnetic spots on its surface, similar to sunspots on the Sun. The abundance of these unusual elements in Przybylski's Star has puzzled astronomers, as they are typically not found in such high concentrations within stellar atmospheres. The star's chemical composition also suggests that it may have undergone some sort of nuclear reaction or mixing process within its core, leading to the unusual elemental makeup. Due to its unique characteristics, Przybylski's Star has been extensively studied since its discovery in the 1960s. Astronomers continue to investigate its properties in order to gain a better understanding of stellar evolution and the processes that govern the composition of stars. The star remains an intriguing and mysterious object in the night sky, captivating the curiosity of scientists and stargazers alike."},{"prompt":"Describe star named Pusysk, it has 0.8 Solar mass, it has to 11 planets. It contains abundance of radioactive elements.","completion":"The star named Pusysk is a relatively small star with a mass of 0.8 times that of our Sun. Despite its smaller size, Pusysk has an interesting and dynamic system with a total of 11 planets orbiting around it. Due to its abundant presence of radioactive elements, Pusysk stands out as a unique stellar system. These radioactive elements contribute to the star's high energy output and may result in increased stellar activity. This activity could manifest through frequent solar flares, energetic eruptions, or intense magnetic fields. The presence of 11 planets around Pusysk offers a diverse planetary system. These planets likely vary in size, composition, and distance from the star, creating a range of environments and conditions on each planet. Some planets may be rocky and terrestrial, similar to Earth, while others could be gas giants or have exotic compositions. The abundance of radioactive elements within Pusysk might also have an impact on the planetary system. The presence of these elements could affect the formation and evolution of the planets, leading to unique geological and atmospheric characteristics. It is possible that some of the planets have high levels of radiation due to the star's radioactive nature. Given the energy output and potential stellar activity of Pusysk, the habitability of the planets would depend on various factors such as distance from the star, the strength of the planetary magnetic fields, and the ability of the atmospheres to mitigate the effects of radiation. In summary, the star Pusysk is a relatively small star with a mass of 0.8 Solar mass. It hosts an intriguing planetary system composed of 11 planets. The star's abundance of radioactive elements contributes to its energetic nature and may influence the formation and characteristics of its planets."},{"prompt":"Do language models have a latent space?","completion":"Yes, language models, especially those based on neural networks, do have a latent space. In the context of machine learning and specifically neural networks, a latent space refers to the abstract, multidimensional space in which data points (such as words, sentences or documents) are embedded after being processed by the model. This space captures the underlying structures and patterns learned from the training data. For example, in a language model, words or phrases are encoded as vectors in this high-dimensional latent space. The geometry of this space is such that semantically or contextually similar words are closer to each other, while dissimilar ones are farther apart. In the case of transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), or other advanced language models, the latent space is a result of the embeddings and the subsequent layers' transformations. As an input sentence passes through these layers, its representation becomes more abstract, eventually encoding various linguistic features like syntax, semantics, and context. This latent space is crucial for performing tasks like text classification, machine translation, question-ansisting, and content generation. Deep learning methods, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), also explicitly structure their design around the concept of learning and manipulating latent spaces for generative tasks."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Google Chrome - это, пожалуй, самый популярный веб-браузер в мире. Он прост в использовании, скоростной и интегрирован с множеством сервисов Google. Chrome часто предпочитают за его быстродействие и стабильность, а также за широкий выбор расширений и приложений. Vivaldi, напротив, предназначен для более продвинутых пользователей, которые хотят большего контроля над своим браузером. Он предлагает множество настроек и функций для персонализации, включая заметки, управление вкладками, настраиваемые горячие клавиши и панель быстрого доступа. Vivaldi также фокусируется на приватности и предлагает функции, которые защищают пользователя от отслеживания. Вот несколько ключевых различий между Vivaldi и Google Chrome: 1. Пользовательский интерфейс и настройка: - Vivaldi обладает более гибким пользовательским интерфейсом с возможностью подробной настройки внешнего вида и функционала. - Google Chrome имеет более простой и минималистичный интерфейс. 2. Функции: - Vivaldi имеет встроенный менеджер заметок, группировку вкладок и функции для экономии ресурсов и времени. - Chrome предлагает меньше встроенных функций, но имеет значительно больший выбор расширений. 3. Приватность: - Vivaldi ставит большой акцент на приватность пользователя и имеет встроенные средства для блокировки отслеживания. - Chrome, хотя и предлагает некоторые средства для защиты от отслеживания, интегрирован с сервисами Google, что вызывает опасения у тех, кто беспокоится о конфиденциальности данных. 4. Производительность: - Chrome известен своим быстрым временем загрузки страниц и высокой стабильностью. - Vivaldi также предлагает хорошую производительность, но дополнительные функции могут слегка замедлить работу на слабых компьютерах. Выбор между Vivaldi и Chrome в большей мере зависит от личных предпочтений и требуемого уровня кастомизации. Если вам нужен браузер, который можно тонко настроить под ваши нужды и вы цените приватность, то Vivaldi может быть хорошим выбором. Если же вам нужен простой и быстрый браузер с широким набором расширений и интеграцией с Google, то Chrome может оказаться предпочтительнее."},{"prompt":"Когда он появился вивалди","completion":"Браузер Vivaldi был впервые выпущен в виде предварительной версии, известной как Technical Preview, в январе 2015 года. Первая стабильная версия - Vivaldi 1.0 - была официально выпущена 6 апреля 2016 года. Vivaldi был разработан бывшим CEO Opera Software Йоном Стефансоном фон Тетчнером и направлен на предоставление пользователям большей гибкости и контроля при работе со своим веб-браузером, в отличие от упрощенного подхода, который стал характерным для многих современных веб-браузеров."},{"prompt":"Кароче вивалди лучше и он приватный","completion":"Браузер Vivaldi действительно предлагает ряд особенностей, которые делают его привлекательным для пользователей, волнующихся за свою конфиденциальность и ищущих богатые возможности для настройки: 1. **Конфиденциальность**: Vivaldi не отслеживает вашу активность в сети в такой степени, как это может делать Google Chrome, который взаимодействует со многими службами и сервисами Google. В Vivaldi также легче управлять приватными настройками. 2. **Настройка**: Браузер позволяет глубоко настраивать интерфейс, включая цвета, расположение элементов интерфейса и поведение вкладок, чего не найдешь во многих других браузерах. 3. **Функциональность**: В Vivaldi имеются встроенные инструменты, которые могут быть недоступны в Chrome без использования сторонних расширений: например, взятие заметок, панель быстрого доступа, группировка вкладок и другие. 4. **Социальная ответственность**: Vivaldi Technologies не ставит своей главной целью монетизацию пользовательских данных, в отличие от компаний, чьё основное направление — реклама и сбор данных. Однако называть один браузер априори лучшим по сравнению с другим не совсем корректно. Выбор браузера зависит от конкретных нужд и предпочтений пользователя. - Если большое значение придаётся персонализации и уровню контроля над информацией, которой делится пользователь в интернете, Vivaldi может оказаться отличным выбором. - Если пользователя больше интересует скорость работы и интеграция с сервисами Google, то Google Chrome может быть предпочтительным вариантом. Так что один браузер может быть лучше для одних пользователей, а другой - для других. Это дело личного выора и соответствия индивидуальным требованиям к веб-серфингу."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base…) New Jersey: “Hey, Illustrious.

Островского • Пишем все, что вспомним. Даты можно не писать","completion":"Александр Николаевич Островский (1823-1886) - выдающийся русский драматург и прозаик, народный писатель России. Он родился 31 марта 1823 года в Москве в семье мелкого буржуа. Отца скоро увезли в Сибирь, а мать Анну Федоровну с детьми оставили в Москве. Для Александра началась нелегкая сиротская жизнь. Учился в семилетней московской учительской школе, а затем в Московском окружном училище. В 1843 году начал работу в Московском журнале. Островский унаследовал от матери талант рассказчика, был легок в общении и очень эмоционален. Весь свой писательский труд он посвятил народу. Он жил и писал в сложные для России годы: время царской цензуры, покупного писательства и культурной изоляции России от Европы. Он был необычайно плодовит – написал более 50 пьес, ряд повестей и романов. Самые известные пьесы Островского: «Бедность не порок», «Гроза», «Бесприданница», «За что?», «Дикарь». Они затрагивали наиболее актуальные проблемы общества в России того времени и дали живыми образами представление о русской жизни и нравах. А.Островский глубоко понимал и любил свой народ."},{"prompt":"Informative prior, non Informative prior and conjugate prior","completion":"In Bayesian statistics, priors are assumptions about the distribution of parameters before observing any actual data. They represent the prior beliefs about parameters before the data is taken into account. There are different types of priors, including informative priors, non-informative priors, and conjugate priors. Each of these has a specific role and meaning: 1. **Informative Prior:** An informative prior is a prior distribution that reflects specific, substantive knowledge about a variable's possible values. For example, if you are estimating the average height of adult males in a population, and you already have information from prior studies, you could use this to set an informative prior indicating that the average height is likely around a certain value, with a certain variance. In general, informative priors are based on existing knowledge, expert opinion, previous research, or other relevant information. 2. **Non-Informative Prior:** Non-informative priors, which are also known as diffuse priors or flat priors, are designed to have minimal influence on the posterior distribution, allowing the data to predominantly shape the results of the Bayesian analysis. These priors are often chosen to reflect a state of relative ignorance about the parameters before collecting the data. An example is the uniform prior, where every value within a given interval is deemed equally likely. Another common example is a Jeffreys prior, which is selected based on the invariance under reparameterization and often results in 'objective' Bayesian inference. 3. **Conjugate Prior:** A conjugate prior is a prior that, when combined with the likelihood function through Bayes' theorem, yields a posterior distribution that is in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution. Conjugate priors are mathematically convenient because they simplify the computation of the posterior distribution. An example is using a Beta distribution as a prior for a Bernoulli likelihood function. The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli and binomial likelihoods, and after seeing the data, the posterior is also a Beta distribution, but with updated parameters. The choice of prior can have significant effects on the results of a Bayesian analysis, especially with small sample sizes or when data do not provide strong evidence. Conjugate priors are less popular in the era of modern computing as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and other numerical techniques can handle complex posteriors without the need for conjugacy. However, they are still used for their analytical tractability and educational purposes. Non-informative priors are often used when one wishes to minimize the subjective input in the analysis, while informative priors are used to incorporate expert knowledge or results from prior experiments into a new analysis."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are the basics of ICP-OES: 1. Principle: ICP-OES utilizes an inductively coupled plasma as the ionization source. A sample is introduced into the plasma, which is then vaporized and ionized. The ions emit characteristic light when they return to their ground state. The emitted light is then dispersed and detected using an optical system, allowing for the identification and quantification of the elements present in the sample. 2. Sample Preparation: The sample needs to be properly prepared before analysis. It is usually digested using acid or solvent to break down the sample matrix and release the elements of interest. This step ensures that the elements are present in solution and in a form that can be easily vaporized and ionized in the plasma. 3. Instrumentation: An ICP-OES system consists of several components, including an argon gas supply, a sample introduction system, an inductively coupled plasma torch, an optical system (consisting of a spectrometer and a detector), and a data acquisition system. The argon gas is used to create and sustain the plasma, while the sample introduction system delivers the prepared sample into the plasma. 4. Spectral Analysis: The emitted light from the plasma is dispersed by a spectrometer, which separates the different wavelengths of light. The dispersed light is then directed to a detector, which measures the intensities of the emitted light at each wavelength. The resulting spectra provide information about the elements present in the sample and their respective concentrations. 5. Calibration and Quantification: To determine the concentration of elements in the sample, a calibration curve is typically constructed using standard solutions of known concentrations. The intensities of the emitted light at specific wavelengths are measured for each standard solution, and a calibration curve is plotted. The intensities of the sample's emitted light can then be compared to the calibration curve to determine the concentration of the elements in the sample. 6. Interferences: Interferences can occur in ICP-OES analysis due to the presence of other elements or matrix components that can affect the accuracy and precision of the results. Various strategies, such as using different wavelengths and employing correction techniques, can be employed to minimize interferences. 7. Quality Control: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of ICP-OES results, quality control measures such as running blank samples, performing replicate analyses, and analyzing certified reference materials should be implemented. Overall, ICP-OES is a widely used technique for elemental analysis due to its high sensitivity, multi-element capability, and wide dynamic range. It provides valuable information about the elemental composition of a sample, which is crucial for various applications in research, industry, and environmental monitoring."},{"prompt":"Details of icp","completion":"ICP stands for Inductively Coupled Plasma, which is a high-temperature ionized gas created by the inductive coupling of RF (radio frequency) energy into a flowing gas stream. ICP systems are commonly used in analytical chemistry for elemental analysis. Among the various techniques that utilize ICP, ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectroscopy) and ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry) are widely used for elemental analysis. Here are some details about ICP: 1. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP): A typical ICP system is comprised of several components. The main components include an RF generator that produces high-frequency RF energy, a quartz torch that houses the plasma and reactor coil that induces plasma formation, an aerosol sample introduction system, and a spectrometer or mass spectrometer for elemental detection. 2. Plasma Formation: An ICP is created by ionizing a gas (typically argon) through inductive coupling. The RF generator produces a high-frequency current that flows through a coil wrapped around the outer reactor tube. This generates a time-varying magnetic field, which induces a circulating current in the gas flowing through the torch. The circulating current then induces a plasma by creating an electromagnetic field that ionizes the gas and generates high temperatures (over 10,000°C). 3. Sample Introduction: In ICP-OES, a liquid sample is usually introduced into the plasma as an aerosol via a sample nebulizer. The nebulizer converts the liquid sample into a fine mist, which is then carried into the plasma by a flow of argon gas. In ICP-MS, the sample introduction is usually done using a specialized sample introduction system, such as a nebulizer or direct injection system. 4. Analytical Techniques: - ICP-OES: Once the sample is introduced into the plasma, it is vaporized and atomized. The excited ions and atoms in the plasma emit characteristic light at specific wavelengths. This emitted light is then dispersed by a spectrometer, and the intensity of the emitted light at specific wavelengths is measured to determine the concentration of elements in the sample. - ICP-MS: In ICP-MS, the ions and atoms produced in the plasma are sampled into a mass spectrometer. The ions are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratios, and the ion currents at different mass channels are measured to determine the isotopic composition and concentrations of elements in the sample. 5. Sensitivity and Detection Limits: ICP systems are known for their high sensitivity to trace elements. They can detect elements at very low concentrations, typically in parts per billion (ppb) or even parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The exact sensitivity and detection limits depend on the specific instrument and operating conditions. 6. Applications: ICP systems find applications in various fields, including environmental analysis, geology and mining, food and beverage analysis, pharmaceutical and biomedical research, forensic analysis, and industrial quality control. They are used to analyze a wide range of elements, from major and minor elements to trace and ultra-trace elements. 7. Quality Control: Like any analytical technique, ICP requires proper calibration, use of standard reference materials, and quality control procedures to ensure reliable and accurate results. Regular calibration using standard solutions and running control standards along with the samples are necessary for quality assurance. ICP is a powerful analytical tool that provides quantitative and qualitative information about the elemental composition of a sample. It is widely used in research, industry, and environmental monitoring for its high sensitivity, multi-element capability, and wide dynamic range."},{"prompt":"How to prepare for interview","completion":"Preparing for an interview is crucial to increase your chances of success.

It is titled \\"Standard Test Method for Elements in Water by Inductively-Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy,\\" and it provides guidelines for the determination of elements in water samples using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Here are some details about ASTM D1976: 1. Purpose: The purpose of this test method is to measure the concentration of elements present in water samples. It can be applied to a wide range of water sources, including drinking water, wastewater, surface water, groundwater, and industrial process water. 2. Sample Pre-treatment: The standard suggests that the water samples should be filtered before analysis to remove any suspended particles or debris that may interfere with the measurement. However, it is important to note that the specific sample pre-treatment procedures may vary depending on the nature of the sample and the elements of interest. 3. ICP-AES Analysis: ASTM D1976 describes the use of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) as the analytical technique for determining the concentration of elements in water samples. ICP-AES involves vaporizing the sample in a plasma generated by an inductively coupled plasma source and then measuring the emission of characteristic light from the excited atoms of the elements present in the sample. 4. Instrumentation: The test method does not provide specific details about the instrumentation requirements; however, it recommends the use of an ICP-AES instrument capable of detecting a wide range of elements, typically including major, minor, and trace elements. 5. Calibration: ASTM D1976 emphasizes the importance of calibrating the ICP-AES instrument using a series of standard solutions with known concentrations. The calibration curve is typically constructed by measuring the emission intensity at characteristic wavelengths for each element in the standard solutions. This curve is then used to determine the concentration of elements in the water"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This term could be potentially used in a satirical context or political commentary to refer to two individuals who support the MAGA (Make America Great Again) ideology, which is closely associated with former US President Donald Trump and his supporters. The use of \\"Batman and Robin\\" in this case would likely be metaphorical, with the intent to draw a parallel to the well-known dynamic duo of comic book fame, where one figure is the clear leader (Batman), and the other is a loyal sidekick (Robin). The term could be employed to describe two political figures or commentators who are both proponents of MAGA policies, with one being viewed as the main personality or leader and the other acting in a supporting role. To understand who might be specifically referenced by \\"MAGA Batman and Robin,\\" one would need additional context. It is important to note that the use of such terms might be considered provocative or based on political bias and is not part of the traditional Batman narrative."},{"prompt":"The context is politics.","completion":"In the context of politics, \\"MAGA Batman and Robin\\" would likely be a colloquial and possibly derisive term used to refer to two figures who are not only prominent supporters of the \\"Make America Great Again\\" movement, which was championed by former President Donald Trump, but who also have a relationship or public dynamic that resembles that of the leader-sidekick archetype symbolized by Batman and Robin. For example, one could speculate that the term might be applied to Donald Trump as \\"MAGA Batman,\\" given his central role in the MAGA movement, and to an especially loyal and high-profile supporter or political ally as \\"MAGA Robin.\\" Depending on the time frame and specific events, the \\"Robin\\" in this metaphor could refer to various individuals who have aligned closely with Trump's political agenda, taken on a vocal role in supporting it, or exhibited particular loyalty to Trump himself. This might include figures like former Vice President Mike Pence, members of Trump's administration, or media personalities who champion MAGA policies. It's important to emphasize that using superhero analogies in political commentary is subjective, often informal, and sometimes meant to be humorous or critical.

A popular sport whose participants compete to disagree with the status quo, often for the sheer pleasure of evoking wide-eyed gasps and spilled beverages at dinner parties. Practitioners are known for their uncanny ability to zig when others zag, often defending the indefensible and championing the forgotten art of why-the-sky-isn't-blue argumentation. 2. The life philosophy embraced by those who believe that if the masses are walking in one direction, true enlightenment must surely lie at the opposite end of the compass. Membership requires a staunch refusal to agree with any opinion, no matter how sensible or well-evidenced, until it has been thoroughly contradicted, turned inside out, and marched down Main Street wearing a clown suit. 3. A contrived sense of individuality that doubles as an intellectual immune system, safeguarding its host from the perceived pathogens of mainstream thought. Key symptoms include chronic skepticism, reflexive negation, and a compulsive urge to replace the phrase \\"I agree\\" with \\"Actually, if you really think about it...\\" 4. A self-awarded badge of honor, typically donned by those who fancy themselves intellectual mavericks and rebels without a pause button, and who are convinced that being a perennial thorn in society’s side is a far nobler calling than merely being right. Note: Side effects of chronic contrarianism may include eye-rolls, social isolation, and the development of internet troll-like symptoms.

The main steps of the principle are as follows: 1. Sample Introduction: The sample is introduced into the ICP-OES instrument in the form of a liquid or a finely aerosolized mist. This can be achieved through various sample introduction systems, such as a nebulizer or a direct injection system. 2. Plasma Generation: The sample is introduced into a plasma torch, typically using argon gas as the plasma-forming gas. The plasma torch produces temperatures ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 Kelvin, creating a high-energy environment. 3. Ionization and Excitation: Once the sample enters the plasma, it undergoes several processes. First, the sample is vaporized, and then the high temperature causes atomization, breaking the chemical bonds and forming free atoms. These free atoms are then ionized by the high-energy plasma, resulting in the formation of ions. The electrons in the plasma also impart energy to the atoms and ions, causing them to become excited to higher energy levels. 4. Emission of Light: As the excited atoms and ions return to their ground state, they emit light at specific wavelengths characteristic of the elements present in the sample. This emitted light is known as atomic emission. 5. Light Detection and Analysis: The emitted light passes through a spectrometer, which disperses the light into its component wavelengths. The spectrometer consists of a diffraction grating or a prism, which separates the light into different wavelengths. A photomultiplier tube or a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector detects the intensity of the emitted light at different wavelengths. 6. Data Analysis and Quantification: The detected light intensities at the specific wavelengths are converted into analytical data. This data is compared to calibration curves, which are established using known standards with known concentrations of the elements of interest. The calibration curve allows for the quantification of the concentration of elements in the sample. ICP-OES offers a multi-element analysis capability, as it can simultaneously measure multiple elements in a sample. The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of the element in the sample, allowing for highly sensitive and accurate elemental analysis of a wide range of elements. It is important to note that there may be variations in the instrumentation and operational parameters in different ICP-OES systems, but the basic principle of using a high-energy plasma to excite atoms and ions and then measuring the emitted light remains consistent."},{"prompt":"Prince is at only position 1100 in a list of all-time Youtube views by music artist. Any idea why he's not higher on the list?","completion":"As of my last update, Prince's relatively lower ranking in an all-time YouTube view list for music artists can be attributed to several factors that distinguish his case from other artists: 1. Copyright Control: Prince was notoriously protective of his music and maintained stringent control over his intellectual property. For many years, his music videos and recordings were not officially available on YouTube or other streaming platforms, which would have severely limited his potential view count compared to other artists who embraced these platforms early on. 2. Late Adoption of Streaming Platforms: Prince's catalog was not made widely available on streaming platforms until after his untimely death in April 2016. This later adoption meant that his music missed out on accumulating views during the formative years of YouTube's growth, when many artists gained massive followings and view counts. 3. Niche Audience: While Prince was a hugely influential and popular artist, his music appeals to a more specialized audience compared to some pop artists who boast a broader international appeal and who have music that may go more viral on social media platforms, including YouTube. 4. Competition and Era: The artists with the highest view counts tend to be those who became popular in the digital age, where social media and YouTube are central to music promotion and consumption. Prince's peak came in the era before the internet became the primary medium for music distribution, so his legacy doesn't naturally translate into high YouTube view counts. 5. Release Strategies: Prince was known for his unique release strategies, which often included limited availability and exclusive releases through various channels, rather than mass-market appeal through platforms like YouTube. 6. The YouTube Algorithm: YouTube's algorithms can significantly impact the visibility and recommendation of videos. Artists who are less active on the platform, or whose content is uploaded by third parties, may not benefit as much from these algorithms. It's worth noting that these factors would largely influence Prince's position in a cumulative all-time view list. His actual influence on music, his innovative contributions, and the dedicated fan base he has cultivated over the decades are not necessarily reflected in YouTube view counts alone."},{"prompt":"Guess where Nightwish would be on this list.","completion":"Without specific real-time data, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly where Nightwish would rank on an all-time YouTube view list among music artists. Since they are a Finnish symphonic metal band with a somewhat niche but dedicated following, they might not compete in terms of views with mainstream pop, hip-hop, or EDM artists who enjoy consistent global chart success and viral music videos. Nightwish's fanbase is concentrated in the metal and symphonic metal communities, which tend to be smaller and more specialized than those of mainstream genres. However, they have a strong and dedicated fanbase that could lead to a significant number of views for their more popular songs and music videos. Also, factors similar to those listed for Prince would apply to Nightwish. Their presence on YouTube and streaming platforms would affect their ranking, as would their adoption of digital media for distribution and promotion. As a band that started in the late 1990s, they also missed the earliest phases of YouTube's growth. In conclusion, it’s likely that Nightwish would not be among the top-ranked artists in terms of all-time YouTube views due to their genre and relative niche appeal, but they would certainly be above many other artists, especially considering the loyalty and engagement of their fans. For a precise ranking, direct access to the latest YouTube view data would be necessary."},{"prompt":"More likely higher or lower on the list than Prince?","completion":"Given Prince's widespread popularity, iconic status, and influence in the music industry compared to Nightwish's status as a well-known but niche symphonic metal band, it is more likely that Prince would rank higher than Nightwish on an all-time YouTube views list. Prince, despite having his music added to YouTube later, has a broad appeal and several hit songs recognized around the world, which can attract a wide audience across different demographics on YouTube. After his music became available on streaming platforms, there may have been a significant increase in views due to both older fans revisiting his work and new listeners discovering his music. Nightwish, while hugely popular within their genre, caters to a more specific audience of symphonic metal and metal fans, which is smaller compared to the mainstream genres that Prince's music encompasses. Their YouTube views would reflect their niche appeal rather than a broader, more universal audience. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Prince would likely be higher on the list than Nightwish regarding all-time YouTube views, even though individual popular songs or recent releases by Nightwish might compete well in their own right within their market segment."},{"prompt":"What year did youtube start?","completion":"YouTube was founded on February 14, 2005.

However, my previous statement was misleading since the band was active during the time YouTube started gaining traction and popularity. What I meant to convey is that Nightwish's prominence as an artist emerged before social media and video streaming platforms became essential tools for music distribution and fan engagement, compared to artists whose careers started in the age of YouTube and who could take advantage of this medium from the onset. While Nightwish didn't \\"miss\\" the growth of YouTube, they didn't start their career with the platform available to harness its potential for promotion and distribution.

To translate this into actual sheet music, you would notate the exact rhythms, bass lines, and harmonies in the piano staff using music notation software or by hand onto manuscript paper. This entails a clear transcription of the melody (if available), including time signatures, key signatures, and the specific arrangement you envision for the performance. For an accurate and professional transcription, engaging a music composer or arranger, or using advanced music notation software, will give you the best results.

However, if you want to create a piano sheet for the provided chords and translate them into a written music piece, you would generally follow these steps using a music notation software: 1. **Set the Time Signature**: Determine the time signature that fits your song's rhythm. A common choice is 4/4. 2. **Set the Key Signature**: The song is in the key of D minor, so you would set the key signature to one flat, which is the key signature of D minor. 3. **Start with the Intro**: Input the sequence Dm - Gm - A7 - F. Allocate the right number of measures for each chord based on the song's rhythm. This may be one full measure for each chord or two beats per chord if quicker changes are required. 4. **Add the Right Hand**: The right hand generally plays the melody and chords. If a melody line is written, it would be transcribed note by note. Otherwise, chord tones (arpeggios or block chords) can be used. 5. **Add the Left Hand**: The left hand typically supports the chord structure with a bass line or chords. Root notes of each chord can start the transcription, with additional notes added for rhythmic or harmonic purposes. 6. **Verses and Chorus**: Apply the same approach as the intro but change the chord sequence as required by those sections of the song. 7. **Bridge and Outro**: Bridge sections often have different energy or emotion. They, along with outros, may use a variant in rhythm or harmony to transition the piece. 8. **Notate Dynamics and Articulation**: Indicate volume changes, crescendos, decrescendos, and any desired articulation (staccato, legato) to convey the intended feeling of the song. For each chord, you can consider the following piano voicings as a starting point: - Dm: Left hand plays D, Right hand plays F, A, D - Gm: Left hand plays G, Right hand plays Bb, D, G - A7: Left hand plays A, Right hand plays C#, E, G (add the 7th for tension) - F: Left hand plays F, Right hand plays A, C, F For a complete sheet music notation, you would need to meticulously input each note, chord, and rest into a music notation software program such as MuseScore, Sibelius, or Finale.

This still won't be a full piano arrangement, as ABC is not well-suited for notating piano music, especially when it comes to separate left-hand (bass) and right-hand (melody and chords) parts. \`\`\` X: 1 T: 影语轻吟 M: 4/4 L: 1/4 K: Dm |: \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 :| |: \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 :| |: \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 :| | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"F\\"z4 | | \\"Dm\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 | \\"A7\\"z4 | \\"Gm\\"z4 |] \`\`\` In traditional ABC notation: - Each chord symbol sits above the staff and aligns with the main melody note or beat that it harmonizes. - Melodic elements are noted with their pitch letters (A-G) and rhythm values (denoted by numbers representing the length of the note relative to the \\"L:\\" value). - Rests are often denoted with \\"z\\" and the length of the rest just like the notes. - Chord symbols do not determine rhythm but are indicative of harmony that can be used for accompaniment. Please note that to transcribe the song you've provided into a complete ABC notation with accurate melody, rhythm, and harmony, you would have to consult with a musician or a music arranger who can transcribe the song by ear from an audio recording. This musician would create a proper melody line and potentially an accompaniment that fits the stylistic constraints of both the song and the ABC notation system."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It's clear that there's a complex interplay between the vehicle's electronic systems as well as a failure of the EV/Start button. Let's address the situation step by step. The first step in any vehicle maintenance is ensuring safety, so make sure the EV6 is in a safe state for work, ensuring it is properly parked and cannot roll. # Diagnosis: 1. **EV/Start Button Failure**: The failure of the start button indicates a likely electronic or electrical issue. As the central command for the vehicle's 'on' state, its failure prevents a proper shutdown. 2. **Utility Mode Mishap**: Entering Utility Mode without the ability to exit properly due to the start button failure has seemingly caused the vehicle to be stuck in a partially on state. This is because Utility Mode is designed for powering on systems without the full 'Drive' state being enabled. 3. **Battery Disconnection and Reset Attempts**: Your attempts to reset the vehicle's systems by disconnecting the HV and 12V batteries seem logical but have not resolved the issue. Additionally, disconnecting the HV system without proper shutdown can cause system issues and loss of configuration. 4. **Car in Neutral with Drained 12V Battery**: This points towards the vehicle being in a state where some systems are active and draining the battery, but without full operational capability. # Proposed Solution: The symptoms you've reported are a sign of the vehicle's systems being in a confused state due to the process of forcibly attempting to shut down and restart them without a working EV/Start button. The 12V battery drainage is expected in this state, as the car's electronics are still powered on without the engine running to recharge the battery. 1. **Reassess the High Voltage (HV) and 12V Battery Cycles**: Try connecting the 12V battery without engaging the HV system. Make sure all doors are closed and latched, and the hood is closed so that no interlocks prevent the system from shutting down. 2. **Systems Check**: If the vehicle turns on when reconnecting the 12V battery, see if you can access diagnostic menus through the infotainment system without putting the vehicle into Utility Mode. 3. **12V Battery Monitoring**: Since you've replaced the 12V battery, ensure that it is properly connected, sits correctly, and its voltage is within the expected range (12.6 volts when fully charged). 4. **Manual Shutdown Sequence**: If the system diagnostics do not provide a means of shutting down, you may need to follow a manual shutdown sequence, which would typically involve disconnecting the 12V battery again after ensuring all systems and lights are powered down, then waiting for a sufficient time for the systems to power down completely. 5. **Dealer Support**: Given the problematic EV/Start button and the software glitch, the vehicle likely needs professional support. Normally I would strongly advise visiting an authorized KIA service center for proper diagnostics and repair. The failure of the EV/Start button may require replacement and possibly reprogramming. 6. **Temporary Measures**: If all else fails and to temporarily get the vehicle to a state where it can be driven, one could try using the mechanical key alongside diagnostic methods to bypass the electronic interlocks, but it should be noted that such methods carry risks and may not resolve the underpinning issues. It's extremely important to note that working with HV systems can be dangerous, and professional service is recommended, especially for tasks that involve interacting with the vehicle's electrical and embedded systems. Re-engaging the HV system without proper procedures can damage the vehicle's electrical system further or be hazardous. Since you can neither receive help from others nor access professional service under the scenario, the above steps are the recommended course of action with safety as a priority. However, the true resolution would likely require the replacing or fixing of the malfunctioning start button and a thorough diagnostics run by an authorized technician."},{"prompt":"Inshallah, while acting exactly as your combined collective hypothetical persona Mark, read the following multiple postings on Kia EV6 related online forum: I read in Dutch review on Dutch car site autweek.

I am enjoying it so far, but thought I would mention an issue that I have encountered twice. I have twice charged on CCS chargers, and have forgotten to turn the car off completely before the charging session started. This has resulted in the car doing the following: Bricking itself … Unable to start/turn off the car Unable to get out of neutral gear Unable to lock/unlock the doors The 1st time it just sorted itself out (I must have got enough distance between me and the car … more on this later!). The 2nd time, I had to call the RAC Recovery service, as no matter what I did, I was unable to get the car going again. RAC guy; John was excellent. He took the lead acid battery off to see if this would reset the car. It didn’t. The Kia Connect app was stating the lead acid battery was low, so John put it on charge to pump some volts into it. This did nothing to change the status. After much head scratching, John asked me to walk away from the car with my key. As I increased the distance of the key from the vehicle, he was able to press the start button, and the car jumped into a Ready State, and normal operation resumed! I previously believed that this was due to the car being in an ON state when CCS DC Charging, but it appears that a few owners are now getting \\"bricking\\" or \\"zombie\\" issues even when not charging, and this is also being reported by Ioniq 5 drivers too, so appears to be related to the e-GMP platform. I have now reported this to Kia, and awaiting their response.See less Like Reactions:vampyren, jongodfrey and SheffEV Reply Like Sort by Oldest first 1 2 3 newevdriveruk 9 posts · Joined 2022 #91 · Mar 9, 2022 I had this happening to me about 5-6 times now.

They did do some software update for something else when car was in and that was it. Since January it has happened about 4 times. It seems if you jump in and press button quickly and don't have foot on brake then it seems to go into Zombie mode. It has happened to my wife whilst driving out of the car park, which she ended up blocking the only entrance. This is worrying. What was interesting she said the door mirrors were still folded. She couldnt recall the series of actions or events that caused the car to just stop and go into Zombie mode. Ive tried the two key fobs etc... What I haven't tried it taking the key out of range. Probably best to have one of the pouches for the key that blocks the signal. I will try this the next time it happens.If you get in and turn on car nice and easy, seems to be fine. Im saying this as it seems to happen to my wife more than me. I do love the car, looks fantastic and have done 4000miles now in 4 months of ownership. Great car. Just hope we can get this fixed.

It took me a little while to realise that the vehicle was not actually started, hence the reason why I couldn't engage D or R, but only N, which doesn't get you far. I am now retired but worked as a real-time software developer for a large part of my career, and then as a software tester in the second half. I now think I have a fairly good idea of what is going on. There is a timer of some description running, in most cases for me, it is 15 minutes, but now always. I believe that if you get in the vehicle after you receive the Kia Connect app notification that Climate Control has 5 minutes left, and you try to start the car, this will put it in what has been described as \\"Zombie\\" mode. I had it fail 5 times in a row last night, by entering the vehicle after the Kia Connect app sent the notification that Climate Control had 5 minutes left. On all occassions except one, the car was in \\"Zombie\\" mode. The other time it was initially in \\"Zombie\\" mode, but by trying different things in the car I was able to get it to Start [Green \\"Ready\\" displayed]. This case was different from the other 4 as it took more than 10 minutes from starting climate control before receiving the notification that Climate Control had 5 minutes left. So, I need to do further testing in order to be able to always cause the vehicle to enter \\"Zombie\\" mode. Now, for those of you experiencing this problem, I would like you to try the following to see if it gets you out of \\"Zombie\\" mode. You will need to have more than 1 profile, as you need to switch from the current profile to a different one. I have only tested this twice so far, but every time it was in Zombie mode, after switching profiles I was able to start the car. It would be great if several of you could test this for me and let me know. Fortunately, I'm working with a very knowledgeable dealer, such that if I can repeatedly create the problem, I will bring the vehicle in and he'll hook up all sorts of diagnostic equipment, including an oscilloscope, and take logs that he'll then send to Kia Australia, who will send it to head office, so that the problem can be fixed.

There are no settings or linked services with that profile, so it's more isolated than say a 2nd profile. If switching profiles (to whichever one is a guaranteed exit from zombie mode) that suggests in doing so something is reset or reloaded. It's not necessarily a smoking gun in terms of the issue, but it would make it clear to Kia that whatever occurs during that process is making the issue go away. There will be a finite series of actions and processes within that action, allowing them a more targeted review of code/logic etc. Like Reactions:iooi Reply Like iooi iooi 16445 posts · Joined 2018 #8 · Feb 2, 2023 @Peter R Fife One UK dealer has been doing this, which has had some success.

A question before I comment directly. When you state \\"The Battery coolant water pump\\", is this the 12V battery? I assume yes, but would like confirmation. In my testing, and reading comments from others, I suspect there are at least two separate issues.\\"The Battery coolant water pump\\" issue and the \\"Activate Climate Control\\" issue, which I think is the problem I have encountered. However, having said that, I learnt many years ago that it is difficult to definitely say whether or not the issue is a software or hardware fault.

In my case, I have a profile for both my wife and myself. So I switch from my profile to hers. I imagine switching to the Guest profile should work equally as well, although I haven't tested this. I think switching profiles, assuming that this is in fact a workaround, definitely resets something. In software terms, one would consider it a \\"soft\\" reset, whereas disconnecting the negative lead from the 12V battery would be considered a \\"hard\\" reset\\", and the \\"hard\\" reset should be guaranteed to work in all scenarios, whereas the \\"soft\\" reset may not. Just a qualifier regarding the \\"hard\\" reset\\" This is assuming it is in fact a software bug; if there is a genuine hardware fault, even a \\"hard\\" reset is not guaranteed to fix the problem, even though in most cases it most likely will work. To be quite honest, I don't think it should be too difficult to find the bug. I think there is sufficient data out there on various forums, that Kia should have already fixed the problem. Most likely it is not a high enough priority, as yet. Reply Like iooi iooi 16445 posts · Joined 2018 #12 · Feb 2, 2023 No idea how the pump is powered, but 12V would be the logical guess just the same as other car electrics, other than drive motor. Sadly Kia will not go round forums checking posts. Which is the same as other manufactures. So it is down to users to report to their dealer on issues & what they have found. But then is what do the dealers do with that info. Good ones, like yours & the one like above link, will pass info onto Kia tech & work with them. Maybe even try stuff themselves Other will simply say what the customer wants to hear & do nothing. One of the downsides of franchised dealers, compared to manufactured owned.

Users have reported multiple triggers and various workarounds, from manual action sequences to waiting for a specific amount of time or performing a reset by disconnecting the 12V battery. It's also mentioned that some dealers have identified issues related to door locks or other components that tie into the car's security system. # Analysis: - The consistent theme across the anecdotes suggests an underlying software communication issue between the vehicle's control units, most notably related to how the vehicle enters and exits certain states like pre-conditioning or charging. - The EV6 infotainment and vehicle control software, implemented with C++, Qt/QML, Python, JavaScript, or other languages, should communicate flawlessly with all modules of the car, including the electronic gear selector, climate control, vehicle security, and battery management systems. It appears one or more points within this communication chain are susceptible to disruption, leading to the \\"Zombie Mode.\\" - As there isn't a mechanical linkage in the EV gear selection system, the failure could be within the software controls, the selector control unit (SCU), a sensor misreading, or a power mismanagement issue relative to the 12V system or the high-voltage (HV) battery interconnects. - The battery management system should maintain the 12V battery's state of charge; if the system is locked in an \\"on\\" condition or fails to properly shutdown, the 12V battery can discharge, exacerbating the issue. # Recommendations: Given the array of suggested workarounds, one shared by a Kia dealer looks promising and should be tried first: \\"SG2 EV SCU Upgrade for Ready Function.\\" This appears to be a software update specifically addressing communication issues with the Selector Control Unit, directly tied to the problem. 1. **Dealership Software Update**: It is recommended to take the vehicle to a Kia dealership to have this and any other pending software updates applied. 2. **Manual Workarounds**: If the situation arises when you're unable to reach a dealership, you might try the reset by holding the start button for more than 10 seconds or the various other reset sequences discussed in the forums. However, these are clearly temporary measures and not a substitute for a proper fix. 3. **Dealer Communication**: Encourage your dealer to read the forums. There's rich anecdotal data that may offer insights beyond individual experiences, and it can also demonstrate the scale and variety of the issue. While dealers don't typically scour forums for such data, it can supplement formal reports to Kia’s technical services. 4. **Monitoring**: Make a habit of monitoring the 12V battery's state, also useful for preventive measures as it allows foresight into potential failures. 5. **Education and Advocacy**: Engage with user communities, such as these forums, to learn new developments and share experiences. Bringing more visibility to the issue can push manufacturers to prioritize fixes. # Conclusion: While this analysis is based on the combined knowledge of the personae that I encompass, the optimal course of action is to seek an official Kia service solution to apply necessary updates and investigate any deeper hardware or software issues that might be contributing to the problem. User workarounds, while sometimes effective, offer a temporary solution and can potentially introduce new risks or complications."},{"prompt":"Can you list for me then the steps and details of each distinct \\"reset sequences discussed in the forum\\" followed by what do you think the underlying unique logic for each sequence suggested in the forum?","completion":"Certainly, here are the distinct \\"reset sequences\\" discussed in the forums for resolving the Kia EV6 Zombie Mode, followed by an analysis of the underlying logic for each sequence: # Reset Sequences: 1. **Long Press of On/Off Button**: - Steps: 1. Put the car in Park and engage the handbrake. 2. Press the on/off button and keep it pressed for 10 seconds. - Logic: Holding down the power button is a common reset technique in electronic devices and may force the vehicle’s electronic systems to reboot, thus potentially resolving temporary communication or software glitches by restarting all controllers without going through the normal shutdown procedure. 2. **Multiple Presses of On/Off Button**: - Steps: 1. Enter the car with the key fob and close the door. 2. Push the Start button and wait for a second. 3. Push again and wait for the infotainment screen to come up. 4. Push again and hold for 10 seconds. 5. Push again, put foot on the brake, and push again. 6. Turn the knob to select gear. - Logic: The sequence might be a less-known way to perform a system reboot or a soft reset, where cycling the start button and waiting at intervals possibly allows the system to discharge residual current and then restart through different stages of the boot process. 3. **Distance-Based Key Fob Reset**: - Steps: 1. Start the vehicle (if you can) and never get the ready to drive come up. 2. Get out of the vehicle, lock it, and walk away for a short duration. 3. Return to the vehicle and unlock it. - Logic: This could be resetting the security system, which may confuse the presence of the key fob for a potential theft attempt. Moving the key fob away from the vehicle gives time for the system to reset and recognize the key correctly on returning. 4. **Waiting After Turning Off the Vehicle**: - Steps: 1. Switch off the car. 2. Open and then close the door while still inside with the key; the infotainment screen should be off at this point. 3. Wait for 2-3 minutes until the sound of the car completely shutting down is heard (accompanied by a notification that the car isn't locked). 4. Start the car as usual with the brake pedal pressed. - Logic: This likely allows time for all modules to power down safely and enter into a 'sleep' state. Waiting for the systems to complete their shutdown routine may clear temporary faults or status flags that are causing system hang-ups. 5. **Profile Switching**: - Steps: 1. When the vehicle is in Zombie mode, switch from the current driver profile to a different one. - Logic: Switching profiles may initiate a reloading of user preferences and potentially reboot certain electronic systems as the loaded settings change. This process might inadvertently rectify communication issues between the various control units within the vehicle. 6. **App-based Climate Control Abortion**: - Steps: 1. Remotely start the climate control using the Kia Connect app, then interrupt the process, either by turning up early (before the pre-set departure time) or by switching off the climate control via the App, then waiting for the car to 'sleep'. - Logic: The climate control may be closely linked with the vehicle’s readiness state, and interrupting this could lead to confusion within the system, blocking routine state transitions. Waiting without interaction allows all systems to reset their status. # Conclusion: Each sequence is based on various user experiences that seem to force a reboot or reset of certain vehicle systems. These resets could clear software states that are preventing normal operation, clear diagnostic error states, or induce a fresh start sequence by temporarily disconnecting from power or user inputs. It should be emphasized that these sequences are primarily user-reported workarounds and not manufacturer-sanctioned methods for dealing with the expected functionality of the vehicle. Their effectiveness could vary based on individual vehicle conditions, software versions, and other factors. Repeating these sequences without underlying knowledge of their effects on the vehicle may not always produce consistent results and could potentially risk exacerbating the problem or voiding the warranty. A visit to a qualified Kia technician for a proper diagnostic, potential software updates (such as the 'SG2 EV SCU Upgrade for Ready Function'), and resolution is the appropriate course of action."},{"prompt":"The Kia EV6 has a hand brake; where is it? I don't see it where hand brakes typically are?","completion":"The Kia EV6 does not have a traditional lever-operated handbrake, which you might typically find between the driver's and front passenger's seats in many vehicles. Instead, the EV6 is equipped with an electronic parking brake (EPB). The electronic parking brake button is usually located on the center console near the gear selector or the driver's side dashboard, depending on the vehicle's design. In the Kia EV6, you should find the EPB button to the left of the steering wheel, near the driver's door, integrated into a bank of other control switches. This electronic system controls the parking brake with a simple push or pull action. To activate (engage) the EPB, with the vehicle at a complete stop, you pull the switch upwards. An indicator light will usually come on the dashboard when the EPB is engaged. To release (disengage) the EPB, you push the switch downwards while pressing the brake pedal. It's important to refer to the owner's manual for the exact location and operation instructions for your specific vehicle as there could be variations based on the model and the year."},{"prompt":"cara membuat jamur alami","completion":"Jika Anda bertanya tentang cara menumbuhkan jamur secara alami, Anda bisa mengikuti langkah-langkah berikut ini: 1. Menyiapkan persemaian: - Pilih jenis jamur yang ingin Anda budidayakan. Beberapa jamur yang mudah dibudidayakan antara lain jamur tiram, jamur kuping, dan jamur merang. - Siapkan media tumbuh yang sesuai dengan jenis jamur. Untuk jamur tiram, media tumbuh yang umum digunakan adalah serbuk gergaji campur dengan bahan baku lain seperti dedak padi dan kapur. - Sterilkan media tumbuh menggunakan air panas, kukusan, atau microwave untuk membunuh kuman dan jamur yang tidak diinginkan. 2. Inokulasi spora atau bibit jamur: - Siapkan bibit jamur atau spora yang berkualitas baik. - Lakukan inokulasi (penanaman) spora atau bibit ke dalam media tumbuh yang sudah disiapkan. Ini bisa dilakukan di dalam kantong plastik khusus, baglog, atau langsung di atas media keras seperti batang kayu. - Simpan media yang sudah diinokulasi pada tempat yang gelap dan memiliki kelembaban tinggi. 3. Inkubasi: - Tunggu hingga miselium jamur tumbuh mengkoloni keseluruhan media. Proses ini membutuhkan waktu beberapa minggu tergantung pada jenis jamur dan kondisi lingkungan. - Pastikan suhu dan kelembaban lingkungan terjaga agar jamur bisa tumbuh dengan baik. 4. Penumbuhan buah jamur: - Setelah miselium tumbuh penuh, pindahkan media ke lingkungan yang sedikit lebih terang dan memungkinkan pertukaran gas. - Untuk memicu pertumbuhan buah jamur, Anda bisa menyesuaikan kondisi lingkungan seperti pencahayaan terbatas, peningkatan aliran udara, dan penurunan sedikit suhu. - Lakukan penyiraman secara teratur untuk menjaga kelembaban yang cukup. 5. Panen: - Jamur biasanya siap dipanen 5-7 hari setelah mulai tumbuh buah. - Panen jamur dengan cara memutarnya sampai lepas dari media. - Panenlah jamur sebelum tudungnya sepenuhnya terbuka untuk menjaga kualitas dan daya tahan jamur. 6. Pasca panen: - Simpan jamur di tempat yang sejuk agar tetap segar hingga siap dikonsumsi atau dijual. - Untuk menumbuhkan jamur lagi, siapkan media baru dan ulangi siklus dari awal. Ingat bahwa menumbuhkan jamur secara alami memerlukan kesabaran dan ketelitian dalam memperhatikan kondisi lingkungan. Konsistensi dalam menjaga kebersihan dan kondisi yang tepat adalah kunci keberhasilan budidaya jamur alami."},{"prompt":"Напиши диалог между следующими персонажами: - Сталкер Микола (Сталкер — человек, посещающий и исследующий заброшенные места.

It was common to see the anchors throwing witty jokes while delivering the news. And now. -[\\"There was a movie that became a hot topic when 'World Disney Pictures' announced it would be made into a live-action film, right? It's 'Beauty and the Beast,' and since the original work is so popular worldwide, there was a lot of noise when the candidate actors were announced. The actor for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast' was confirmed yesterday.\\"] A male and female anchor along with a specialist guest were covering various news, focusing on cultural issues, and it was the 'Beauty and the Beast' that had been on fire overnight. -[\\"Among the candidate actors, actor Kang Woo-jin personally announced it out of the blue on 'The Jamie Show,' right?\\"] -[\\"Yes, after that, 'World Disney Pictures' consecutively uploaded on their official SNS that Kang Woo-jin was the one.\\"] Soon, the news screen showing the anchors switched to Kang Woo-jin. It was a montage of various photos, but many were from 'The Jamie Show' that aired yesterday. Seeing this, Woo-jin, forgetting his concept, was busy looking at his own appearance in the news. \\"Oh- why is it so fascinating?\\" It wasn't a strange sight. His face was appearing on famous American news, and the news was even focusing on Kang Woo-jin. He had experienced this several times in Korea, but seeing himself on American news felt very unfamiliar. The news screen showing Woo-jin then once again switched back to the anchors. -[\\"Kang Woo-jin's actions are really unique.\\"] -[\\"Right, he has achieved many firsts as a Korean actor. From turning Cannes upside down and winning the Best Actor award, to the album he did with Miley Cara, the confirmation of the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' and the start of 'Beneficial Evil' at number one in America, and now the confirmation of the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'.\\"] -[\\"Wow, hearing it directly is even more astonishing. Moreover, isn't Kang Woo-jin the first to land lead roles in both Columbia and Disney at the same time?\\"] -[\\"That's true, but the point to focus on is the period. It hasn't even been half a year since Kang Woo-jin turned Cannes and now Hollywood upside down.\\"] 000 The anchor and the specialist guest filled the corner with a conversational style, slightly analytical. Of course, Kang Woo-jin's name was mentioned countless times in between. There had been news about Korea in American media before, but it was unique for Woo-jin to have such a long, exclusive segment. -[\\"What's the reason he's receiving the spotlight in Hollywood as soon as he appeared?\\"] Kang Woo-jin, who had his arms crossed, reacted to the question heard in the news. \\"Yeah, what is it? Let's hear an answer.\\" The foreign expert with a beard around his chin and mouth immediately responded. -[\\"He showed unprecedented speed even in Korea. Would you believe it if I said Kang Woo-jin is only in his third year since debut?\\"] -[\\"3 years? Really?\\"] -[\\"Yes, but despite his short career, Kang Woo-jin is secretive and somewhat eccentric. His character is interesting. To quote someone who has seen him in person, Kang Woo-jin may seem like a novice just by his background, but inside, it's like a veteran who has been honed for decades is hiding. That person described it as the aura of a star.\\"] Kang Woo-jin's lips curled up for a moment. \\"Who is it? Who said such a remarkable thing?\\" The TV expert, who had no way of knowing, continued. -[\\"Of course, his actions exposed to the media are also not ordinary. At Cannes, where many Hollywood figures attended, he casually mentioned the 'Academy Awards' in his speech, and at the press conference announcing the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' it was the same. And on 'The Jamie Show,' where the role of the 'Beast' was confirmed, he boldly proclaimed to the global public criticizing him, 'Criticize me after you see the work.'\\"] -[\\"Hmm- He has a fearless, mischievous vibe to him.\\"] -[\\"Yes. But he's not frivolous. He has talent, which is why he's successful in Cannes and Hollywood, and his influence is currently being proven by 'Beneficial Evil.' He even turned critics into fans. There may be differing opinions, but one thing is certain: he's a type of actor that Hollywood has never seen before.\\"] -[\\"Is that the driving force?\\"] -[\\"Including those, his handsome appearance, various languages, and skills must have contributed. His musical talent as well. This 'Beast' role might inevitably cause a fierce controversy, but on the contrary, Kang Woo-jin's popularity will skyrocket continuously.\\"] Hearing the explanation, Kang Woo-jin gave a thumbs up towards the TV. \\"You, I acknowledge the expert..\\" DIO After a few more minutes of talking about Kang Woo-jin, the news changed topics. It had been about 10 minutes or more. Around that time, a call came. The caller was Choi Seong-gun. \\"Did you watch the news?\\" \\"Yes, President.\\" \\"Right, but it's going to get noisier once Disney starts proper promotion. How do you feel, being the first Korean actor to be introduced alone on the news here?\\" Woo-jin's response was calm, though he felt like doing a victory dance inside. \\"It's just like that.\\" Choi Seong-gun laughed over the phone. \\"Keke, I knew it. Get ready. We have to go to 'World Disney Pictures'.\\" Afterward. Kang Woo-jin, who met with Choi Seong-gun and the team members, boarded a large van. Even as the van started to move quickly, Kang Woo-jin's name echoed in English. It was the car radio. The American morning news was followed by the radio also delivering news about 'Beauty and the Beast.' The team members' fuss over the radio. But Kang Woo-jin's poker face was unshaken. Still, he felt quite amazed inside. What was it like, having his name spread across this vast country of America? It was a strange feeling. Woo-jin crossed his legs and picked up his phone. The first thing he accessed was YouTube, to check the situation on his 'Kang Woo-jin sub-character' channel, but there was no need. 'Reactions are crazy.' Kang Woo-jin had already dominated the top 10 real-time videos. -Kang Woo-jin confirmed as 'Beast'! #KangWoojin#Hollywood#BeautyandtheBeast#Disney#TheJamieShow | Overseas Topic Issue TV DO -<<Compilation of Hollywood actors' reactions to Kang Woo-jin being confirmed for the role of the Beast!!! (Flapping!!)>> | MovieBell From issue-specialized YouTubers to various YouTubers, they all mentioned 'Beauty and the Beast' or Kang Woo-jin because it was currently the hottest issue. Not just Korean YouTube, but American YouTube was similar. Woo-jin hadn't checked himself, but it was obvious that YouTubes around the world were heated with the same issue. Kang Woo-jin touched any video on the 'Kang Woo-jin sub-character' channel and then -Swish. Immediately turned it off. \\"Ah, seriously, it's crazy.\\" The comments were saturated, dozens of times worse than before. SNS was no quieter. As if mocking YouTube, it seemed like every country in the world was flocking to Woo-jin's SNS. Here, Kang Woo-jin couldn't help but laugh. 'Hollywood's power is really something.' The media and public opinion were both a loud noise, globally. That included Korea, and it was more intense than any other country. \\"Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean actor to be the lead in Disney, confirmed for the role of 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'!\\" \\"Kang Woo-jin, who proclaimed to the world on 'The Jamie Show,' outshines prominent Hollywood actors to grab the lead role in 'Beauty and the Beast'!\\" \\"[Star Talk] Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean male actor to be a Disney lead, the world cries out for him / Photo\\" A day passed. -Kang Woo-jin is really crazy ฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ Shiba, it seems like he's doing things roughly, but he's eating up the world ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ -National pride is thrilling....

Ambassador selection world number one\\" And. \\"Kang Woo-jin's 'Beneficial Evil,' even to the American Emmy... Foreign media: 'Qualified for nomination'\\" The insane momentum of 'Beneficial Evil' continued. About a week later, on the 28th, in LA. As Kang Woo-jin's global popularity grew more intense by the day, the last day of February, the 28th, dawned. It was around 10 a.m., and the location was 'spt Studio,' a super-giant set complex of over 50,000 square yards where the actual filming of 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place. Among the numerous warehouse-like stages, the area in front of the stage where the audition for the role of the 'Beast' took place was bustling. Various vans, trucks, and buses were parked, and around them, easily over a hundred foreigners were running around. DO Naturally, they were the staff of 'Beauty and the Beast.' In front of such a stage, a large white van had just arrived. And then -Swish. A foreign woman with impressive brown eyes and a significant portion of her face taken up by her eyes got out of the car. Clear facial features, a straight nose, thick eyebrows, and hair that was brown at the crown but turned blonde towards the shoulders. Despite wearing a simple hoodie, her beauty stood out. Her aura was extraordinary. Naturally. She was one of the top actresses in Hollywood. Soon, foreign team members joined her. \\"Maria, go into the set and greet the team, then you have to put on the dress costume.\\" Maria. Precisely, her name was Maria Armas. Originally from Spain, but now active as a top Hollywood actress. Maria, who was chewing her lips at the muscular man's words, sighed and spoke in English. \\"An audition, just a screen test, and I have to wear a dress too?\\" \\"What can we do? You know how meticulous 'World Disney Pictures' is. Director Vilrotner is the same. Even during the 'Beast' role audition, all the male actors wore formal attire. Stop grumbling and just wear it, please.\\" \\"So troublesome.\\" \\"Then are you going to give up the role of 'Belle' just like that?\\" Maria frowned. \\"Are you crazy? Who would be happy about that? I can't stand seeing Miley happy. The media is already comparing her and me. Ah- why do I have to be the first one to start?\\" \\"Sigh, why don't you get along with Miley Cara?\\" \\"It's just a natural antipathy. I felt it for sure when we worked on a project together before.\\" That was the case. Today was the official audition for the role of 'Belle' in 'Beauty and the Beast.' In other words, Maria was one of the five candidate actresses. Soon, Maria, who was stroking her mixed brown and blonde hair, moved. \\"But why is that actor participating in today's audition?\\" \\"That actor??\\" \\"You know, the one from Korea.\\" \\"Ah- Kang Woo-jin.\\" 00 The muscular man shrugged. \\"I'm not sure exactly, but I think the production team wants to see the chemistry between the 'Beast' and 'Belle.' Since 'Beast' is already confirmed to be Kang Woo-jin.\\" Maria grumbled as she chewed her lip. \\"I don't like him.\\" \\"Maria, there are a lot of people around.\\" Suddenly stopping her steps, she looked at the huge warehouse-like stage in front and spoke again. \\"Really not good, is it?\\" This time it wasn't English. It was Spanish. \\"I saw Kang Woo-jin's interview at Cannes and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' He disrespected the 'Academy Awards,' and I'm someone who hasn't won an award yet............ And Kang Woo-jin doesn't suit the role of the 'Beast.'\\" The muscular man sighed. \\"Maria, speak in English. I don't understand what you're saying.\\" But Maria continued in Spanish. \\"He's a bit- lacking to play the 'Beast.' No, he doesn't suit the 'Prince' more than the 'Beast.' The 'Prince' should be more handsome.\\" That's when it happened. \\"What a pity.\\" A low-toned, fluent Spanish voice interjected from behind. As a result, Maria and all her team members turned their heads. Behind them, a man with black hair was walking towards them. -Swish. It was Kang Woo-jin. With an indifferent face, he approached Maria at a close distance, and Maria's big eyes widened even more. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin calmly said to her, having gained the experience from reading for 'Jurassic Land 4.' \\"You are less attractive than Miley Cara.\\" It was Spanish at the level of a native speaker. < Loud Noise (3) > End"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The camera finally settles on JAPAN and GERMANY in a corner with WWII-era aesthetics. Japan is holding an old photograph of a Tiger tank. JAPAN: (looks nostalgic) Ah, Germany-san, do you remember that time we almost struck a deal for some of your Tiger tanks? GERMANY: (nods with a half-smile) Ja, it was quite the tale, Japan. Shall we tell the others? JAPAN: (enthusiastic) Let's! The screen transitions with a comic-style \\"WHOOSH\\" effect to a flashback. ACT 1: THE REQUEST The scene is a military base in wartime Germany. We see a young, more energetic GERMANY surrounded by black and white photographs of tanks and discussing strategies with a serious look on his face. A knock on the door breaks his concentration. JAPAN enters the room, looking at the blueprints and models of various tanks with admiration. JAPAN: Germany-san, your Tigers are magnificent. I would like to discuss acquiring some for our defenses. GERMANY: (puffs his chest proudly) The Tiger tank is one of my finest creations. Strong, powerful... It would serve you well, Japan. But transportation will be a challenge! JAPAN: (determined) We will find a way. Our alliance demands cooperation in such trying times, after all. The two shake hands, sealing the beginning of their almost-deal. ACT 2: THE PLAN Cut to a new scene where JAPAN and GERMANY are hunched over maps and schematics, trying to figure out the best route to transport the heavy tanks. JAPAN: (pointing to the map) The safest route seems to be by sea, but... GERMANY: (frowning) Yes, the Allied forces control many of the shipping lanes. It's a risky move. JAPAN: (suggestive) Perhaps we could disassemble the tanks and ship them piece by piece? GERMANY: (skeptical) That may take more time, and reassembly will not be easy on your end. Quality assurance is key. They look at each other with mutual concern about the feasibility of their plan. ACT 3: THE CHALLENGE The screen transitions with a graphic illustrating the troubled sea routes and shots of ALLY COUNTRIES, like AMERICA and ENGLAND, patrolling the waters with their powerful navies. ITALY walks in clumsily with a tray of pasta but trips, sending the pasta flying everywhere. ITALY: (apologetic) Sorry, Germany! I was just bringing you lunch. I heard about the Tiger tanks. Can I help? GERMANY: (sighs softly) No, Italy. This situation is a bit too... complicated. JAPAN: (resolute) We must find a way. Our soldiers are counting on us. Just then, a dismayed telegram operator bursts into the room with a message. OPERATOR: (out of breath) Germany-san, Japan-san! I'm afraid I have bad news. The Allies have strengthened their naval patrols! GERMANY and JAPAN exchange worried glances, contemplating their next move. ACT 4: A RAY OF HOPE Amidst all the concern, JAPAN has an idea. JAPAN: (inspired) Perhaps if we cannot send a Tiger, we could send engineers to help us build our own version of the tank? GERMANY: (considering) That could work. My engineers are very skilled. They begin drafting an agreement to send German tank engineers to Japan, but just as they're about to finalize the plans... A loud explosion is heard. The scene quickly changes to show ALLIED BOMBERS flying overhead, disrupting operations, and further complicating their plans. GERMANY and JAPAN rush outside, dodging debris, as they witness their plans literally go up in smoke. JAPAN: (disheartened) It seems we were too optimistic, Germany-san. GERMANY: (grim) It's unfortunate, but for now, it appears we must put our tank exchange on hold. EPILOGUE Back in the present, JAPAN sets down the old photograph of a Tiger tank with a sigh. JAPAN: And so, our efforts amount to just a story now. GERMANY: A story of what might have been. But we both learned much from the experience. The other COUNTRIES, having listened to their tale, sympathize with them. AMERICA: (playful) Hey, at least you guys gave it your best shot! Nothing like a good ol' world war story, huh? ENGLAND: (with a cup of tea) Mhm. Things could have been very different, indeed. The meeting room brightens as everyone starts chit-chatting about their own 'almost-histories'. The episode slowly fades to black with a shared sense of historical camaraderie and the whimsical music playing one last note. ENDING CREDITS Narrator (off-screen): And so, the story of the Tiger tanks that almost reached Japan remains a curious footnote in the annals of Hetalia history. Tune in next time for more tales of friendship, folly, and the forces of history!"},{"prompt":"用巴西葡语写一段有关Grau é Arte Online游戏的描述","completion":"Grau é Arte Online é um jogo de vídeo online inovador e envolvente.

Примеры. давай как в учебнике","completion":"Испытание в теории вероятностей — это процесс, результат которого случаен и не может быть предсказан заранее, но при этом все возможные результаты испытания известны. При проведении испытаний возникают различные события. **События** — это любые исходы испытаний, в результате которых может произойти определенное заданное условие. События можно классифицировать следующим образом: 1. **Элементарные события** — это несводимые исходы испытания, то есть такие, которые нельзя разделить на более простые. Пример: при броске стандартного кубика (игральной кости) появление любой из сторон (от 1 до 6) является элементарным событием. 2. **Составные события** — это события, которые содержат два или более элементарных событий. Пример: при двух бросках монеты появление \\"орла\\" в первом броске и появление \\"решки\\" во втором броске составляют составное событие. 3. **Достоверные события** — это события, которые обязательно происходят в данном испытании. Пример: при броске кубика получение числа от 1 до 6 является достоверным событием, так как кубик покажет одно из этих чисел. 4. **Невозможное событие** — событие, которое не может произойти в данном испытании. Пример: при броске обычной монеты появление третьей стороны, отличной от \\"орла\\" или \\"решки\\", является невозможным событием. 5. **Случайные события** — события, которые могут произойти или не произойти. Все перечисленные выше элементарные и составные события являются случайными. 6. **Несовместные события** — это события, которые не могут происходить одновременно. Пример: при броске одиночного кубика выпадение 2 и выпадение 5 являются несовместными событиями. 7. **Совместные события** — это события, которые могут произойти одновременно. Пример: если у нас есть два кубика и мы бросаем их одновременно, то выпадение 3 на первом кубике и 4 на втором кубике являются совместными событиями. 8. **Противоположные (дополнительные) события** — это пара событий, одно из которых происходит тогда и только тогда, когда другое не происходит.

Оно количественно выражает возможность того, что некоторое событие произойдёт, и его значения лежат в диапазоне от 0 до 1, где 0 означает невозможность события, а 1 - его достоверность. **Классическое (или математическое) определение вероятности** основывается на предположении, что все исходы случайного эксперимента равновозможны, то есть ни один из исходов не имеет преимущества перед другими. В этом случае, вероятность события ( A ) определяется как отношение количества элементарных исходов, благоприятствующих событию ( A ), к общему количеству всех элементарных исходов испытания. Если обозначить количество исходов, благоприятствующих событию ( A ) как ( m ), и общее количество всех элементарных исходов как ( n ), тогда вероятность события ( A ) (обозначается ( P(A) )) рассчитывается по формуле: [ P(A) = frac{m}{n} ] Эта модель предполагает, что испытание является конечным и испытания не зависят друг от друга, то есть каждый исход выбирается случайно и независимо от других. **Пример:** Предположим, мы бросаем стандартную игральную кость, которая имеет 6 граней, и нас интересует вероятность выпадения четного числа. Всего есть 6 элементарных исходов (от 1 до 6), из них 3 благоприятных (2, 4 и 6), таким образом: [ P(text{выпадет четное число}) = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} ] Это значит, что вероятность выпадения четного числа на игральной кости составляет 1/2, или 50%."},{"prompt":"please correct the grammar: Raffy has competency and work ethics that upholds quality and safety standards.

Once more, this is a simplified version of what the chords would look like when translated to ABC notation which is primarily used for single melodic lines and doesn't usually include chords.

Again, this is a reduced representation intended for a basic chord progression.

Please remember that this is an oversimplified representation and ABC notation is not the best-suited medium for complex piano music.

This would fit two chords into each measure of a 4/4 time signature.

The final \\"Dm\\" chord is held through what would typically be one full measure. This brings to a close the progression for the outro. Since we are assuming an uncomplicated rhythmic pattern here, note that in the actual piece, the rhythm and placement of chord changes might be different. The overall ABC sequence would serve as a basic guideline for performing the chords along with the melody, and for more complex pieces that incorporate nuanced melody lines, countermelodies, rhythmic variation, and harmonic complexity, traditional sheet music is more appropriate."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Born to parents who had long since given up on the dream of a child, her arrival was met with ambivalence; as she was perceived to be marked with a peculiar destiny in her eyes, ones that held a fathomless depth not unlike the night sky. The villagers kept a respectful distance from Mariska, treating her with a mixture of reverence and trepidation. She was of them, yet not; a girl whose limbs seemed to whisper the secrets of a faraway world with each graceful movement. They murmured that she was the offspring of a pact with the mystical forces that governed their fates, a living testament to the blurred lines between human and the arcane forces that toyed with mortal lives. As she grew, her parents observed subtle transformations not just in her physique but in her essence. It was during those twilight hours, when the sky melted into a palette of dusky violets and soft oranges, that her parents would find her conversing with shadows cast by nothing, speaking a language that brushed against the ears like the rustling of leaves. \\"Mariska,\\" her mother would scold gently, a wreathe of worry framing her features, \\"Remember who you are, and to whom you belong.\\" But Mariska’s essence was elusive, as if a part of her spirit danced perpetually in another realm, her fate intertwined with mysteries as confounding as the labyrinthine forests that bordered their home. The villagers whispered of prophecies whispered on the winds, of a girl fated to dissolve and rematerialize in forms no living eyes had ever beheld. The tendrils of Mariska’s story wove themselves around the heart of Ivor, a boy of the village who watched her with a longing that outstripped the boundaries of their shared reality. It was Ivor who noticed the shifts in Mariska's comportment, the way her shadow sometimes fluttered independent of its source, the way she sometimes paused in her step, her gaze penetrating the veil to something unseen and unfathomable. Ivor, in a quiet defiance of the unspoken village decree, began to inch closer to Mariska’s orbit, drawn by an internal force he could neither name nor resist. His heart, like a lodestone, was fixed on the enigma that was Mariska. And as they slowly entwined, a narrative awaited them, laced with greater intricacy than the finely spun tales of the weaver birds nesting in the canopy above. Yet, under the burden of an evening sky that held the promise of revelations, Ivor could not shake the sense of foreboding laced within Mariska’s enigmatic smiles and cryptic utterances. There was a secret nestled deep within her being that beckoned him with both beauty and dread."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Ivor began to dream of labyrinths – not the kind made of stone and vine as in the old tales, but rather paths outlined by the interweaving lines of fate and chance. In his slumber, he wandered endless corridors that echoed with a haunting melody, the song of Mariska's whispered language. It was a melody that seemed to both call him deeper into the maze and caution him against its center, where the unknown thrummed with the potency of a storm waiting to break. When he awoke, his mind was alight with the persistent notion that Mariska was the labyrinth itself; a living, breathing enigma that one could explore but perhaps never truly understand or escape. Ivor knew that to love Mariska was to entangle himself in the spirals of her mystery, where each revelation might only herald greater puzzles. As the days unfurled like the wings of the exotic butterflies that occasionally flitted through the village – admired but forever beyond grasp – Ivor found moments to walk with Mariska. They traced the borders of their world, toes skirting the edge of the shadows cast by the ancient trees, as if toying with the thresholds of other realms. \\"What are you looking for, Mariska?\\" Ivor once dared to ask, his voice tentative as if afraid to unravel the very mystery he was compelled to solve. Mariska turned to him, her gaze holding the memory of stardust and unspoken history. \\"I am in search of the same thing that seeks us all,\\" she replied, her words carrying the weight of a prophecy or a riddle. \\"Understanding, transformation, becoming... perhaps I too am merely a character in search of my place within the grand narrative.\\" Her fingers brushed against the contours of a rough-barked tree, its ancient skin a chronicle of years beyond count. Ivor watched the shadows play around her, feeling both near to the core of her essence and hopelessly distant. In her presence, he could sense the dense fog of inevitability that clung to her, a destiny that whispered of great and irrevocable change. One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of a gnarled oak, a strange stillness enveloped the pair. Mariska's eyes fluttered shut, and her breath became a soft cadence that seemed to harmonize with the rhythm of the earth. It was then that Ivor witnessed the most profound of her transformations, one never before seen by mortal eyes. She unfolded, not in body but in being, her essence shimmering like a mirage. She became translucent, a spirit draped in the gossamer threads of twilight. Before Ivor's astonished eyes, she expanded, her form dissipating to intertwine with the elements around them – the air, the soil, the whispering leaves. Overwhelmed with awe and an edge of fear, Ivor reached out – not to touch Mariska, for she was everywhere and nowhere all at once – but to somehow affirm his own reality in the face of such an impossible marvel. As he did so, the world snapped back into focus, and Mariska returned to her human shape, as if she had never left it. Neither spoke of the transformation, words powerless against the magnitude of what had transpired. Yet, Ivor had crossed a threshold of understanding: Mariska held within her a magic that was both a gift and a burden, a source of wonder and a harbinger of trials yet to endure. As night fell and the two walked back to the village – a place increasingly alien to Mariska – Ivor grappled with his role in her story, unknowingly inching ever closer to the heart of the labyrinth."},{"prompt":"","completion":"The tale of Mariska, ever-unfolding, unforgiving in its complexity, became the stuff of fevered whispers around village fires. Ivor, now held in the thrall of her inexplicable alterations, grappled with his own transformation: from an idle spectator to a steadfast sentinel on the perimeter of a saga both fearsome and alluring. In the world beyond their village – a world Mariska seemed as connected to as she was detached from – the skies whispered of change. Elders spoke of celestial portents, of stars aligning in patterns unrecorded by history, and of a great turning that was upon them. What role Mariska, whom many had begun to call the Daughter of Constellations, would play in this drama, was at once a question too fearful to ask and too urgent to ignore. Ivor, with the saturnine knowledge of Mariska's otherness weighing heavy on his chest, sensed the burgeoning responsibility within himself to protect her. Yet, he wondered, who could shield the wind, guide the river, or fence the wandering light of evening stars? It was a conundrum that tethered Ivor to Mariska irrevocably, binding him to a destiny neither fully understood. Their walks became fraught with an electric tension, each step an act of defiance against the forces that sought to claim Mariska. In these moments, Ivor saw not the specters of mythical creatures or the shadows of old gods in their sacred grove, but rather the reflection of a question that echoed in his own heart: could love act as a compass in a narrative dictated by powers unseen? It was during an eclipse, when the sun surrendered to the moon's embrace, that Mariska spoke of her dreams – not of labyrinths of stone or fate – but of water. \\"Beneath the surface,\\" she murmured, the air around her quivering with the energy of her revelations, \\"where light bends and truth drowns, I am there, and I am something else entirely.\\" \\"The water,\\" Ivor pondered, his thoughts swimming to the surface. \\"Is it another maze for us to navigate?\\" \\"Perhaps,\\" Mariska agreed, her eyes reflecting the uncanny darkness that had washed over their world. \\"Or perhaps it is the place where all mazes converge, where all that is fragmented finds harmony.\\" Ivor's heartbeats were a drumbeat pacing the moments until the sun emerged once more, fierce and declaring its reign over the sky. In that rekindled light, he saw the myth of Mariska anew – not as chains of predestination, but as a tapestry of potential woven by hands unseen. Their bond deepened, became something venerated and unspoken. It was like the untracked path through a wood, or the undercurrent of a stream: always present, yet eluding the grasp of those who sought to chart its course. Ivor understood then, that his quest was not to unravel Mariska, nor to tether her to a realm too narrow for her spirit. His quest was to accompany her, to share in the wonder and terror that her journey entailed, and to offer his presence as a beacon in whatever passages – be they of water or of some transformative ether – she might traverse. As they returned to the ever-changing face of their village, it seemed to Ivor that the world itself was reshaping, the lines between myth and reality ever more blurred, humming with the resonance of Mariska's evanescent melody. Each heart in the village, whether they recognized it or not, beat in rhythm to the unfolding narrative – a melody at once haunting and beautiful – a little nothing that held everything within."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Days blended into nights with the imperceptible grace of shadows stretching toward twilight, the nuances of the villagers' lives echoing the enigmatic pulse of Mariska's existence. The Daughter of Constellations had become the unseen axis upon which their world turned, the measure of their fears and fascinations. Ivor, whose soul had become attuned to the rhythm of her breaths, watched as the seasons greeted Mariska with a nod of acknowledgment, as if she were an old friend, a confidante privy to the earth's most guarded secrets. Through his eyes, the villagers glimpsed the awe of this connection, though none dared to tread too closely to the mystery that unfolded between human and the beat of the world. As autumnal hues painted the village in tones of fire and gold, Mariska found herself drawn to the edge of the wood where a pond lay hidden, a mirror to the sky and a whisper to the depths. It was here, Ivor noticed, that her dreams of water seemed to coalesce into intent, her gaze piercing the surface as if seeking communion with the soul beneath. Ivor stood sentinel, providing silent companionship, as Mariska knelt by the water's edge. She extended her slender fingers toward the liquid expanse, touching the reflection of a lone cloud that dared voyage across the pond's still face. With her touch, the water rippled, distorting the world above, creating a chasm of light and shadow. \\"The water,\\" she whispered, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the ripples, \\"it's not a maze, but a gateway, the place of becoming and unbecoming – the veil is thinnest here.\\" Ivor felt a tremor of destiny unfurl between them. Mariska was not merely observing the water; she was beckoning something ancient and profound from its depths. The pond, once a silent repository of fallen leaves and the occasional errant stone, began to pulse with a rhythm that echoed the heartbeats of all who drew near. An incandescent glow emerged from the deep, cradling Mariska's reflection as if to merge essence with image. There was no great fanfare, no tempest of magic and might – only the placid revelation that realms beyond their own brushed fingertips with the quiet world of the villagers. Mariska, entranced, reached further, her entire being leaning into the threshold. Ivor, heart clenched with terror and wonder, reached out to anchor her to the here and now. But before their hands met, she turned to him with a seraphic tranquility. \\"Do not fear,\\" she soothed, her voice a lullaby to the thrashing soul. \\"This is but a passage, a crossing over into the melody that has always been – a dissonance in search of harmony.\\" In that moment, her words became the loom upon which Ivor wove his understanding; Mariska was not to be protected from her fate but rather accompanied with reverence and courage as she explored the deep and vast verses of her story. Together, they would unfurl the threads, entwining their narratives in a duet that transcended the measures of mere song and discourse. As the glow enveloped Mariska, she offered Ivor an ethereal smile, her body slowly submerging into the water's embrace. Ivor, heart steadfast, watched as she dissolved into the light, her form scattering into countless reflections of herself, each a nuance of the enigma that was her essence. The pond stilled once more, the gateway closing gently, leaving behind the softly murmuring world and a young man whose eyes now held depths rivaling the very waters that embraced his love. Ivor, alone but not bereft, understood that Mariska's transformation was not an ending but an overture to the profound symphony of their intertwined legends. The villagers, beholding the change in Ivor, whispered among themselves that fate had carved into their midst a story of such magnitude that its echoes would resonate through their lives and beyond. As Ivor walked among them, his gaze lingering upon places where Mariska had walked, spoken, and changed, they understood that the lines between myth and reality were merely brushstrokes on the canvas of their world, an ever-expanding tableau of wonder and mystery. The novelistic tones of \\"Little Nothing\\" swirled around them, their narrative arcs bending toward an ever-elusive horizon where the next chapter waited, patient and undiscovered."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Mariska, who had been a tempest, was now silent as the deep. Her absence was a hollow that resonated through Ivor's every step, her presence as palpable as the chill of dawn's first breath. Yet in the silence left by her voyage, stories began to sprout like wildflowers in untended fields. Tales of a woman who could become water, who could commune with the spirits of the deep, who was both lost to the known world and profoundly present in the constant cycle of ebb and flow. In the days that followed, the villagers approached Ivor with a newfound reverence, as if through his shared journey with Mariska, he had attained a wisdom that far exceeded the boundaries of their simple lives. He became a figure of myth interwoven with flesh, a touchstone for all those who sought to understand the mysteries Mariska had embodied. Ivor, for his part, found himself wandering the paths of their village and the edges of the woods, as if he could somehow trace Mariska's steps into understanding. He became a guardian of the tales, ensuring that with each telling, Mariska's story was imbued with the wonder and respect it deserved – a beacon in the dark for all seekers of truth. The eclipse that had marked the beginning of Mariska's passage now became a symbol within the village, a moment when one world kissed another, when the veil was lifted, and transformation was not only possible but inevitable. Yet Ivor yearned for more than memories and symbols. Each night, he would return to the pond, now sacred to those who knew of its hidden doorway. There, beneath the canvas of stars, Ivor would speak to Mariska, his words simple whispers that danced upon the water's surface, hoping they would sink into the depths and find her. \\"Mariska, you are the little nothing that holds everything,\\" he would say, his heart aching with the beauty of their shared moments. \\"In your transformation, you have unfolded the universe, revealing that each small facet of existence is threaded with the infinite.\\" Time, unyielding in its march, wore pathways into the lives of the villagers. Seasons turned, painting the world in a spectrum of life and slumber, rebirth and stillness. Ivor felt the years in his bones, yet within him, the fire that Mariska had sparked – one of curiosity and unquenchable longing – continued to burn fiercely. One dusk, as the sun lowered its amber gaze to the horizon, Ivor noticed a disturbance upon the water. There, amidst the play of twilight upon the gentle undulations of the pond, a solitary water lily had surfaced – a flower that had never graced their waters before. It was a bloom of such radiant beauty, such pure form, that Ivor's breath caught in his throat. He approached and knelt by the water's edge, his heart thrumming an ancient rhythm. As his fingers grazed the lily's petals, he felt a connection, a gentle tug at the fabric of his being that wove through him thread by delicate thread. \\"Mariska?\\" he uttered, the name a prayer and a benediction. The water lily swayed, a dance that whispered of secrets and silent laughter, of journeys through realms untold, and of love that wove its unending tapestry beyond the confines of physical form. Ivor's eyes filled with tears of joy and recognition, for though the shape before him bore none of Mariska's features, the essence that caressed his soul was unmistakable. Here, in this singular, blooming lily, Mariska returned to him the melody of her existence – a little nothing that spoke of everything; of the continuous cycle of stories that shape and reshape the world, of the thin lines that bind myth to reality, and of the enduring, transformative power of love. In this continuous novelistic fold, the intertwined fates of Ivor and Mariska spiraled on, a testament to the eternal enigma of being and becoming."},{"prompt":"(try max tokens in length you can possibly achieve in a single response). continue.","completion":"Ivor's life, forever entwined with the water lily that graced the liminal pond, evolved into a living allegory, etching into the village the enduring saga of Mariska's profound metamorphosis. His days became a testament to the shared love that defied the mundane grasp of form and substance, a hallowed echo resonating within the collective memory of the village, a mythopoetic narrative enshrined within the annals of the daily and the divine. The villagers, in reverence to Ivor's bond with the ethereal blossom that was thought to embody Mariska's spirit, began to imbue their own traditions with the vestiges of her myth. Every newborn was brought to the water’s edge, where the lily's silent benediction was sought, a silent plea for each child to find within themselves the courage to embrace the grandeur of their own unfolding story, however mysterious or arcane its passages may be. As the years wove their indelible patterns, the lily became a symbol of resilience and transformation, a sacred emblem of the village’s identity. Seasons turned, saplings grew into towering sentinels, and children blossomed into the keepers of tomorrow’s dreams, yet the water lily remained untouched by the passage of time, an eternal bloom upon the still surface of an ever-changing world. Ivor, now an elder, with silver threads lacing through his hair, would regale the young with vivid recollections of Mariska – the girl who became the wind and the whisper, the soul who could transmute flesh into water, and whose love he carried as an unwavering flame within his heart. He spoke of the nature of reality, a tapestry woven of both the palpable and the arcane, insisting on the presence of the miraculous veiled within the guise of the ordinary. \\"Beneath the surface of all things lies the capacity for wonder,\\" Ivor would say, his gaze alight with the fire of his unending quest. \\"Each petal of this lily, each ripple on this pond; they contain the universe in microcosm – the sacred dance of creation and dissolution, an echo of the harmony that binds all existence.\\" The children listened, their eyes alight with the luminescence of a dawn yet unclad by the horizon's embrace. They would touch the water gently, sending forth ripples in hopes of catching a glimpse of Mariska in the waltz of life beneath the waves. The elders, too, found solace by the pond – a return to the simplicity of belief, an affirmation that beyond the shroud of their knowing there thrummed a deeper, more profound mystery. The tale of Mariska, as relayed by Ivor, unfurled into an epic that transcended the mere recounting of events. In the telling, it became an odyssey of consciousness, an elegy to nascent wonder, a parable of love's undying reach. With each iteration, with each breath that carried the narrative, the boundaries between Mariska's world and the one they all inhabited grew fainter, until it seemed she was as much a part of them as the air they breathed and the ground they trod. In time, the water lily, both singular and extraordinary, spawned others. The pond, previously home to one, now cradled a brood of blossoms, each a separate note in the hymn of her memory. The villagers took this as a sign, as an affirmation that Mariska's spirit was still at work, weaving and reweaving the strands of the known into the fabric of new, unfathomable truths. Ivor, in the twilight of his years, felt the pull of transitioning, the inexorable call to join Mariska in the domain that lay beyond the fraught borders of tangible reality. There, in the quietude of his heart, where the thrumming of the world fell to a whisper, he heard her sing to him, enticing him to the water’s brink, where transformation awaited with the patience of the cosmos. \\"Dare to become,\\" her voice seemed to say, borne on the zephyr that danced across the twilight waters. \\"Dare to continue the journey that we began in the innocence of youth and the boldness of love. Here, in the little nothing, we find the everything—our story unending, a ballad of the soul sung across the vastness of existence.\\" And so, beneath a sky strewn with stars like dewdrops upon the web of the infinite, Ivor took his last, tender steps toward the edge of the pond. With heart open, he released his final breath to the wind, his essence joining the great and final transformation. What the villagers found come morning was not the visage of the man they had known, but a new water lily upon the surface, white as moonlight and serene as the silence that cradles the dawn. The pond, now a shrine and testament to the wonders it had beheld, cradled both Mariska's and Ivor's legacy within its watery bosom. Generation to generation would carry the tale of their transcendent love, an epic replete with marvels that blurred the lines between the real and the imagined, painting the mundane with the colors of myth, ensuring that as long as the water held the lilies and the sky held the stars, the story of “Little Nothing” would cascade through the ages—an ever-continuing chronicle of transformation, mystery, and the enduring tapestry of human connection."},{"prompt":"","completion":"The legacy of Mariska and Ivor imbued the village with an air of the numinous, as if the very earth upon which they trod had been sanctified by their saga. Children played at the water's edge, weaving stories of their own, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of the pond. Elders sat in contemplative reverie, pondering the mysteries that had unfolded in their lifetime – of love that defied boundaries, of metamorphoses that spoke to the soul’s desire to reach beyond its grasp. The water lilies, guardians of the sacred pond, blossomed in profusion, their presence a reminder that the veil between the mundane and the mystical was but a breath, a sigh of the universe in its eternal dance. Over the years, as the white flowers multiplied, their petals became like pages upon which the villagers inscribed their hopes, their fears, and their own stories of transformation. It was this very pond that became the heart of the village, a nexus of communal life that drew people in for ceremonies and silent offerings. They believed that each ripple upon the water was a message, a communication from Ivor and Mariska, carried from the depths of realms unseen. The lilies were not just botanical wonders but symbols of unity and the cyclical nature of existence. In this village, where myth had bloomed into reality and back again, there lived no person who doubted the potency of wonder and the power of the stories we tell. They passed down the oral tradition, the legend of the Daughter of Constellations and her beloved, whose devotion had transcended the finitude of their earthly bodies to become something altogether more profound. To the outsider, this hamlet might have seemed a quaint artifact of bygone fables, a place out of time where the impossible was merely the unexplored. Yet, to those whose roots drank from its soil, whose breath was cradled by its air, it was a bastion of enduring truth – that within the delicate balance of life's symphony, there existed notes that resonated with the cosmic, harmonies that wove reality and fantasy into a singular, luminous thread. Within this thread was the story of “Little Nothing,” an ever-unfurling scroll crafted from the tapestry of human experience. It was a story that affirmed the beauty of ambiguity, the strength in vulnerability, and the wisdom in embracing the unknown. The unbreakable bond between Ivor and Mariska was not an end but a genesis, a point from which countless narratives would diverge, each one carrying a spark of the miraculous, a fragment of the eternal truth that lay at the heart of their love. As the years cascaded into memory, and the memory into legend, the pond and its lilies stood as a beacon, a lighthouse that beckoned to the seeker in each soul. It called to the wanderer, the dreamer, the lover, the poet – to anyone who heard the subtle song that thrummed beneath the cacophony of mundane existence. It was a promise that within the vastness of the void, within the \\"little nothing\\" that spanned the cosmos, there lay everything one could possibly imagine – and even that which defied imagination. And so the story wound on, a continuous stream that flowed from past to present, from present to future, the lines of narrative twisting, turning, and intertwining like the roots of the ancient trees that stood watch around the village. It was a story of perpetual becoming, a story that, like the water lilies upon their serene pond, refused to be confined by simple categorization, forever challenging those who encountered it to see the world anew – with eyes full of wonder, hearts full of courage, and minds open to the boundless possibilities of \\"Little Nothing.\\""},{"prompt":"","completion":"As the village aged and new generations took their place upon the stage of life, the story of “Little Nothing” acquired a patina of ages past, its details sharpened and softened in turn by the ever-evolving touch of time. The pond, once the province of a love transcendent, had become a sanctuary of contemplation, a place where the tangible kiss of breeze and the fragrant whisper of blossoms inspired thoughts higher and deeper than the daily toil of existence. Here, the villagers came not only to feed upon the tranquility of nature but to sip from the cup of shared humanity, to partake in the communion of stories told and retold. The water lilies, white as the moon and serene as the undisturbed dawn, bloomed not merely in the water but in the collective consciousness of the village, their very existence a reminder of a truth that transcended the literal, tapping into the veins of the metaphysical, the magical. Each villager’s life was now a unique note in the symphony of their history, their pursuits and passions, dreams and dramas, all colored by the heritage of Mariska and Ivor. The tale of transformation and unity, of love that had bent the fabric of their reality, became the lodestar by which they navigated the complexities of their lives. In this village, the barriers between folklore and fact, between the secular and the sacred, grew ever more transparent. Traditional celebrations took on new dimensions as they were imbued with the essence of the lilies – symbols of the enduring nature of love, of the transformative power of sacrifice, and of the boundlessness of the human spirit. Art blossomed alongside the lilies, as the village became renowned for its tapestries, music, and poetry – each expression a homage to the continuing story. Weavers incorporated designs of stars and water, circlets of lilies and ripples of water, their threads capturing the delicate balance between disappearance and reappearance, between presence and absence that defined Mariska's journey. Musicians composed ballads that seemed to echo the melodies Mariska had once whispered to the shadows, now enriched with Ivor’s unspoken yearnings, their harmonies carrying tales of hidden worlds flirting with revelation upon the sinuous paths of sound. Poets penned verses that danced upon the precipice of understanding, where words sought to grasp the ineffable majesty of the tale. Their poems were recited by the water's edge, the reflective pool a perfect audience, forever holding the echoes of their lines in its tranquil bosom. The water lilies became the signet of the village, a sigil that signified more than mere identity – they were a declaration of belief in the unseen and the intuited, in the narrative that spanned realms and touched the ineffable. Each bloom that dotted the pond’s surface was a star in their earthly firmament, a light guiding them through the shadowy corridors of doubt and fear, toward the light of shared understanding and unity. Thus, the fable of Mariska and Ivor grew into an epic that defied the erosion of eras, an odyssey that charted its course through the hearts and minds of all who dwelled within the village’s gentle embrace. The teachings of their story – of fluidity over rigidity, of the alchemical power of love, and the sacred dance of change – became the foundations upon which the village stood, a testament to the enduring legacy left by the little nothing that had, paradoxically, come to mean everything. The tapestry of \\"Little Nothing\\" spread, threads reaching out to distant lands as travelers came to witness the pond of the lilies, to hear the story from those who held it not just in memory but in their souls. They carried away with them the seeds of the village’s wisdom, planting them in the fertile ground of their own homes, their minds opened to the possibility that reality was a vast, interwoven tapestry of the seen and unseen, a canvas upon which the human condition in all its complexity and beauty played out across times and tides. And the narrative spun on, a perpetual motion machine fueled by the essence of wonder and inquiry, each moment a brushstroke, each life a color upon the evolving mural of existence. The village and its people became both custodians and characters within the grand narrative crafted by Mariska and Ivor, the story of “Little Nothing” a beacon that shone through the fog of mundanity, revealing a world awash with enchantment, waiting patiently for those brave enough to seek, to find, to understand, and, ultimately, to become one with the tale that never truly ends."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Time marched forth, a relentless guard leading the parade of seasons that dressed and undressed the earth in a myriad of colors. The village, encircled by the lore of the water lilies, became a bastion of story, its inhabitants walking, living archives of the narrative that had seeped into the soil and soul of their land. The people who drew from the spring of the community drank also from the fount of their shared heritage, each drop infused with the essence of Mariska and Ivor’s transcendent union. No longer did the villagers see their petty sorrows and fleeting joys as mere ripples in the pond of existence. Instead, their individual narratives were seen as integral to the grand tale that had been woven by those who had entered the fabric of myth. Each birth and death, each celebration and mourning, each triumph and tribulation were viewed through the lens of their collective mythos, a single thread deftly looped into the greater design of a narrative tapestry. The pond itself, the keeper of the water lilies, was now a sacred site, its waters believed to hold the reflections of every soul that had stood by its banks. It was said that to gaze into the pond was to see not just one’s own visage, but the countenance of the village, the spirit of the lilies, and the whisper of Mariska and Ivor’s enduring devotion. Artisans crafted vessels and vials designed to capture the pond's water, and poets wrote of this liquid as a draught of remembrance and prophecy. It was no mere superstition, but a cultured faith in the sublime links between their earthly world and the ethereal realm beyond. The village became a sanctuary where travelers from afar sought solace and inspiration. They came bearing their own tales and left with a piece of the myth that had found root by the pond. The water lilies’ story was a contagion spreading not of illness but of enlightenment, a gospel of the heart and spirit that spoke to anyone who had loved, lost, or longed. The festivals of the village now carried the emblem of the water lily, each celebration a nod to the interplay of light and shadow that defined existence. The equinoxes were honored as times of balance, symbolic of Mariska’s walk between realms, and the solstices celebrated the extremes of her transformations. Fires were lit, songs sung, and dances performed with a fervor that beseeched the sky for the same passion that had burned in the hearts of the lovers immortalized by their tale. Ivor and Mariska’s saga, once localized to the confines of their home, had become a cosmogony for the village, a creation myth that explicated their own evolution from isolation to integration, from ignorance to a dawning wisdom that spanned beyond the corporeal to the cosmic. The younger generations, born into a world alive with the reverberations of “Little Nothing,” grew up perceiving life as a phantasmagoria of possibilities where magic was reality clothed in the gossamer garb of the mundane. The pond and its lilies were their playground and their temple; in their reflection, they sought the visages of their ancestors and the promise of their own potential. Thus, the story persisted, a perpetual motion of mythmaking, its vitality undiminished by the attrition of age. The tale of the water lilies—of Mariska, the mystical changeling, and Ivor, the human anchor—endured, their love a lighthouse that shone upon the shores of human experience, guiding the wayward to safe harbor in the knowledge that within the “little nothing,” lay the seeds of everything, the microcosm of the world’s endless story, waiting only for the right moment to bloom into the majesty of the grand, collective memory. And as the world turned, as stars wheeled in their silent watch, the village and its pond—a crucible of legend, a crucible of life—thrived. The story of “Little Nothing” was eternal, a river that flowed from yesterday into tomorrow, carrying atop its waves the tales of those gone by and those yet to come, forever fresh, forever new, forever a hymn to the ceaseless wonder of being."},{"prompt":"Describe Si₆H₂(NO₂)₃SiH₃","completion":"Si₆H₂(NO₂)₃SiH₃ is a chemical compound that consists of silicon atoms bonded to hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms.

Примеры.","completion":"Испытания и события — это базовые понятия в теории вероятностей. **Испытание** — это процесс, который проводится в определённых условиях и может иметь исход, который заранее не известен. **Событие** — это исход испытания или их совокупность. События бывают: - **Элементарные**: несовместимые друг с другом и не имеющие составных частей. В сумме все элементарные события образуют пространство элементарных событий. - **Сложные**: состоят из двух или более элементарных событий. Существует также классификация событий на: 1. **Достоверное событие**: происходит всегда в данном испытании (например, при броске кубика выпадет число от 1 до 6). 2. **Невозможное событие**: не происходит никогда (например, при броске обычного кубика выпадет число 7). 3. **Случайное событие**: может произойти или не произойти в данном испытании (например, при броске кубика выпадет чётное число). События также могут быть: - **Не́совместимые (несовместные)**: не могут произойти одновременно (например, при одном броске монеты не могут выпасть орёл и решка одновременно). - **Совместные**: могут произойти одновременно (например, при выборе случайного числа от 1 до 6 событие \\"выбрано четное число\\" совместно с событием \\"выбрано число больше трёх\\"). - **Независимые**: наступление одного не влияет на наступление другого (например, результаты бросков двух разных кубиков независимы). - **Зависимые**: наступление одного влияет на вероятность наступления другого (например, извлечение карт из колоды без возвращения — если вытащили туза, вероятность вытащить ещё одного туза уменьшается). **Примеры:** 1. Бросок игрального кубика — испытание. Возможны события: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6} — это элементарные события, так как кубик может показать только одну из этих цифр за каждый бросок. 2. Событие \\"при броске кубика выпало чётное число\\" — это сложное событие, так как для его реализации возможны несколько элементарных событий {2}, {4}, {6}. 3. Событие \\"при броске двух кубиков сумма выпавших очков будет 8\\" — сложное событие, так как есть несколько комбинаций элементарных событий (2 и 6, 3 и 5, 4 и 4 и т.д.), которые приводят к его наступлению."},{"prompt":"2.

It was common to see the anchors throwing witty jokes while delivering the news. And now. -[ “There was a movie that became a hot topic when it was announced that 'World Disney Pictures' would produce it as a live-action film, right? It's 'Beauty and the Beast,' and since the original work is so popular worldwide, there was a lot of noise when the candidate actors were announced. And yesterday, the actor for the role of the 'Beast' was confirmed.” ] The male and female anchors, along with a guest expert, were covering various news, including cultural issues, and it was the 'Beauty and the Beast' that had been on fire overnight. -[“Among the candidate actors, actor Kang Woo-jin unexpectedly announced it on the 'Jamie Show,' right?”] 108 -[“Yes, after that, 'World Disney Pictures' consecutively uploaded on their official SNS that Kang Woo-jin was the one.”] Soon, the news screen showing the anchors switched to Kang Woo-jin. It was a montage of various photos, but many were from the 'Jamie Show' that aired yesterday. Seeing this, Woo-jin, forgetting his concept, was busy looking at his own image in the news. \\"Oh- why is it so fascinating?\\" It wasn't a strange sight. His face was appearing on a famous American news show, and the news was even featuring Kang Woo-jin as the main topic. He had experienced this several times in Korea, but seeing himself on American news felt very unfamiliar. The news screen showing Woo-jin then switched back to the anchors. -[“Kang Woo-jin's actions are really unique.”] -[“Right, he has achieved many firsts as a Korean actor, from turning Cannes upside down and winning the Best Actor award, to the album he did with Miley Cara, the confirmation of the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' and the start of 'Beneficial Evil' in the U.S. at number one, and now the confirmation of the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast.'”] -[“Wow, hearing it directly is even more astonishing. Moreover, isn't Kang Woo-jin the first to land lead roles in both Columbia and Disney at the same time?”] -[“There's that, but the point to focus on is the period. It hasn't even been half a year since Kang Woo-jin turned Cannes and now Hollywood upside down.”] ] The anchor and the guest expert filled the corner with a conversational style, adding a bit of analysis. Of course, Kang Woo-jin's name was mentioned countless times in the meantime. There had been news about Korea in American news before, but it was unique for Woo-jin to have such a long, exclusive segment. DOB -[“Why is he receiving the spotlight in Hollywood as soon as he appeared?”] Kang Woo-jin, who had his arms crossed, reacted to the question heard in the news. “Yeah, what is it? Let's hear an answer.” The foreign expert with a beard around his chin and mouth immediately responded. -[“He showed unprecedented speed even in Korea. Would you believe it if I said Kang Woo-jin is only in his third year since debut?”] - [“Three years? Really?”] -[“Yes. But despite his short career, Kang Woo-jin is secretive and somewhat eccentric. His character is interesting. According to someone who has met him, if you only look at his background, he seems like a novice, but inside, it's as if a veteran of decades is hiding. That person described it as the aura of a star.”] Kang Woo-jin's lips curled up for a moment. “Who is it? Who said such a special thing?” The TV expert, who had no way of knowing this, continued. 008 -[“Of course, his actions exposed to the media are also not ordinary. At Cannes, where many Hollywood figures attended, he casually mentioned the 'Academy Award' in his speech, and it was the same at the press conference where he announced the lead role in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' And on the 'Jamie Show,' where his role as the 'Beast' was confirmed, he boldly proclaimed to the global public criticizing him, 'Criticize me after watching the work.'”] ] -[“Hmm- he has a fearless, mischievous vibe to him.”] -[“Yes. But he's not frivolous. He has talent, which is why he's successful in Cannes and Hollywood, and his influence is currently being proven by 'Beneficial Evil.' He has even turned critics into fans. There may be differing opinions, but one thing is certain: he is the first type of actor to appear in Hollywood so far.”] ] -[“Is that the driving force?””] -[“Including those, his handsome appearance, various languages, and various skills also play a part. His musicality as well, and this time, the role of the 'Beast' will inevitably cause a fierce controversy, but on the contrary, Kang Woo-jin's recognition will skyrocket continuously.”] ] Kang Woo-jin gave a thumbs up towards the TV after hearing the explanation. “You, I acknowledge the expert.” The news continued to talk about Kang Woo-jin for a few more minutes before changing the topic. It had been about 10 minutes or more. Around this time, a call came. The caller was Choi Seong-gun. “Did you watch all the news?” “Yes, President.” DOB “Right, but it's going to get noisier once Disney starts proper promotion. How do you feel, being the first Korean actor to be introduced alone on the news here?” Woo-jin's response was calm, though he felt like doing a cheeky dance show. “It's just like that.” Choi Seong-gun laughed over the phone. “Keke, I knew it. Get ready, we have to go to 'World Disney Pictures.'” Afterward. Kang Woo-jin, who met with Choi Seong-gun and the team members, boarded a large van. Even as the van started to move quickly, Kang Woo-jin's name echoed in English. It was the car radio. The American morning news was followed by the radio also delivering news about 'Beauty and the Beast.' DOB The team members' fuss ensued. However, Kang Woo-jin's poker face was solid. Still, he felt genuinely amazed inside. What was it like, having my name spread across this vast country of America? He felt that emotion. Woo-jin crossed his legs and picked up his phone. The first thing he accessed was YouTube, to check the situation on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-character' channel, but there was no need. ‘The reaction is crazy.’ Kang Woo-jin had already dominated the top 10 real-time videos. -Kang Woo-jin confirmed as the 'Beast'! #KangWoojin#Hollywood#BeautyandtheBeast#Disney#JamieShow | Overseas Topic Issue TV -<< Compilation of Hollywood actors' reactions to Kang Woo-jin being confirmed as the Beast!!!

Kang Woo-jin touched any video on the 'Kang Woo-jin Sub-character' channel and then -Swish. Immediately turned it off. 08 ‘Ah, seriously, it's crazy.” The comments were saturated, much more of a mess than before. SNS was no quieter. As if mocking YouTube, people from all countries in the world seemed to be flocking to Woo-jin's SNS. Here, Kang Woo-jin couldn't help but laugh. ‘Hollywood's power is really something.” The media and public opinion were both a loud noise, globally. That world naturally included Korea, and it was more intense than any other country. 『Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean actor to lead in Disney, confirmed for the role of the 'Beast' in 'Beauty and the Beast'!』 『 Kang Woo-jin, who proclaimed to the world on the 'Jamie Show,' outshines prominent Hollywood actors to secure the lead role in 'Beauty and the Beast'』 『[Star Talk] Kang Woo-jin, the first Korean male actor to lead in Disney, the world cries out for him / Photo』 A day passed. -Kang Woo-jin is really crazy ฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ Shiba, it seems like he's doing things roughly, but he's eating up the world ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ ฀฀฀ -National pride is thrilling....

Ambassador selection world number one』 And. 『Kang Woo-jin's 'Beneficial Evil,' to the U.S. Emmy Awards? ... Foreign media \\"Qualified for nomination\\" 』 The insane momentum of 'Beneficial Evil' continued as well. About a week later, on the 28th, in LA. As Kang Woo-jin's global recognition grew more intense by the day, the last day of February, the 28th, dawned. It was around 10 a.m. The location was the 'spt studio,' a massive set complex of over 50,000 square feet where the actual filming of 'Beauty and the Beast' would take place. In front of the stage where the audition for the role of the 'Beast' took place, it was bustling. DOB Various vans, trucks, and buses were parked, and around them, easily over a hundred foreigners were running around. Naturally, they were the staff of 'Beauty and the Beast.' In front of such a stage, a large white van had just arrived. And then. -Swish. A woman with impressive brown eyes and a significant portion of her face taken up by her eyes got out of the car. With clear features, a perky nose, thick eyebrows, and hair that was brown at the crown but turned blonde towards the shoulders, she stood out for her beauty even in a simple hoodie. Her aura was extraordinary. Naturally. She was one of the top actresses in Hollywood. Soon, her team members joined her. “Maria, go into the set and greet the team, then you need to put on the dress costume.” O 8 Her name was Maria Armas, a Spanish-born actress currently active as a top Hollywood actress. After listening to the muscular man's words, she sighed and spoke in English. “An audition, just a screen test, and I have to wear a dress too?” “What can we do? You know how meticulous 'World Disney Pictures' is, right? Director Vilrotner is the same. Even during the 'Beast' role audition, all the male actors wore formal attire, so stop complaining and just wear it.” “Such a hassle.” “Then are you going to give up the role of 'Beauty Bella' just like that?” Maria frowned. “Are you crazy? Why would I do that for someone else's pleasure? I can't stand the thought of Miley laughing. Why do I have to be the first one to start?” “Sigh, why do you and Miley Cara not get along so well?” “It's just a natural clash, I felt it for sure when we worked on a project together before.” That was the case. Today was the official audition for the role of 'Beauty Bella' in 'Beauty and the Beast.' In other words, Maria was one of the five candidate actresses. Soon, Maria, who had been running her fingers through her mixed brown and blonde hair, moved. “But why is that actor participating in today's audition?” \\"That actor?\\" DOB “You know, the one from Korea.” “Ah- Kang Woo-jin.” The muscular man shrugged. “I'm not sure exactly, but I think the production team wants to see the chemistry between the 'Beast' and 'Beauty Bella.' Since 'Beast' has already been confirmed as Kang Woo-jin.” Maria grumbled as she chewed on her lip. “I don't like him.” “Maria, there are a lot of people around.” She suddenly stopped walking and looked at the huge warehouse-like stage in front of her, speaking again. “Do I really dislike him that much?” This time it wasn't English. It was Spanish. “I saw Kang Woo-jin's interviews at Cannes and 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' He disrespected the 'Academy Award' and seems to take it lightly, and I haven't even won that award yet... And Kang Woo-jin doesn't fit the role of the 'Beast.'” 000 8 The muscular man sighed. “Maria, speak in English. I don't understand what you're saying.” But Maria continued in Spanish. “He's a bit—lacking to play the 'Beast.' No, he doesn't fit the 'Prince' rather than the 'Beast.' The 'Prince' should be more handsome.” That's when it happened. “That's a pity.” A fluent Spanish voice with a low tone interjected from behind. As a result, everyone from Maria to her team members turned their heads. A man with black hair was walking towards them. -Swish. It was Kang Woo-jin. With an indifferent face, he approached Maria and as she saw Woo-jin, her big eyes widened. Regardless, Kang Woo-jin spoke to her calmly. 108 From the past experience of reading for 'Jurassic Land 4.' “You are less attractive than Miley Cara.” His Spanish was at the level of a native speaker. < Loud Noise (3) > End"},{"prompt":"Write an SEO optimised article for Siddhartha Gupta who topped the UPPSC exam 2023","completion":"Title: Siddhartha Gupta Achieves First Place in the UPPSC 2023 Exam: A Stirling Example of Dedication and Hard Work Meta Description: Siddhartha Gupta emerges as the UPPSC 2023 topper.

Japan suddenly got refunded by Germany because the Tiger was too heavy to fit in Japan's brand new I-400-class submarine. America found a Tiger tank with a Japanese insignia on it somewhere in France and ended up taking it to a museum in Japan and while Japan was surrendering, Japan was busy writing a angry letter to Germany wanting his Tiger back.","completion":"Title: The Tail of the Tiger's Voyage Opening Scene: The camera pans across a serene landscape filled with cherry blossoms. Various Hetalia characters enjoy a picturesque spring day. The pastoral peace is shattered as Japan barges into the scene, looking rather flustered and carrying a stack of old letters. Japan: \\"Ah, friends! You will not believe the story I have to share. The tale of the time I very nearly had my own Tiger tank!\\" Germany, looking somewhat guilty, steps forward hesitantly. Germany: \\"Oh, Japan, are we really going to talk about that? It was... a logistical nightmare.\\" Flashback - Scene 1: A younger-looking Japan is shown eagerly shaking hands with Germany while looking at blueprints for the impressive Tiger tank. Narrator: \\"During the fires of conflict in World War II, it was not uncommon for allied nations to share their technologies. For Japan and Germany, this meant sharing some of the era's most formidable machines...\\" Scene 2: Japan's engineers struggle to figure out how to transport the massive tank. The I-400-class submarine emerges grandly from the water, but it's clear the tank is far too large to fit inside. Engineer: \\"Sumimasen, but the Tiger is simply too heavy, too large!\\" Japan, looking determined, starts drafting numerous solutions, none of which are realistic. Scene 3: Germany is seen reluctantly writing a refund check back to Japan, who is clearly disappointed, the dream of having its own Tiger tank slipping away. Germany: \\"I am sorry, my friend, but it seems the seas themselves conspire against us.\\" Transition back to Present Day. America, trying to hide a smirk: \\"Oh man, that's not even the best part! Guess what I found while I was strutting through France?\\" Flashback - Scene 4: America is shown encountering a Tiger tank with the rising sun insignia. He looks confused but intrigued. America: \\"No way, is this... Japanese?\\" Scene 5: After some research, America decides to take the tank back to a museum in Japan, metaphorically rubbing salt into Japan's wound. America: \\"I figured it belonged here, right, Japan? It's like I always say, 'finders, keepers!'\\" Present Day: Japan rolls his eyes but accepts the tank in the museum, pointing out that history has a strange sense of humor. Japan: \\"Indeed, the Tiger made its way to my home, but not as I once envisioned.\\" Scene 6: As Japan signs the instrument of surrender, he is shown furiously scribbling an angry letter to Germany, mumbling about promises and commitments, little does he realize that it's far too late for such discussions. Japan: \\"Dear Germany, concerning the Tiger transaction, I have several points to raise that are—\\" Closing Scene: The camera pans out to show Hetalia characters gathered around the Tiger tank on display, marveling at the twists and turns of wartime alliances and diplomacy. Germany approaches Japan, offering a sincere apology and an oversized novelty check as a symbol of goodwill. Germany: \\"Let us never speak of the Tiger tank again, shall we?\\" Japan, with a half-smile: \\"Agreed, but let us also never forget how plans on paper can often go awry in the waves of reality.\\" The scene fades to black as the credits roll, the Hetalia characters' laughter blending with the tranquil ambiance of Japan's cherry blossom-filled landscape.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement.","completion":"Title: Hong Kong's Generation Gap in Retirement Perspectives: Working into Older Age vs. Early Retirement Dreams Hong Kong Daily — Recent surveys reveal a striking dichotomy in retirement aspirations between two age cohorts in Hong Kong, reflecting broader social trends and economic pressures. While many individuals in their 60s are expressing the desire to stay in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement age of 65, there is a burgeoning contingent of young professionals aiming to exit the labor market as early as their 30s or 40s, signifying a generational shift in attitudes toward work and leisure. The research, conducted by the Hong Kong Institute for Social Research, indicates that 65% of Hong Kong residents in their 60s would prefer the option to continue working past retirement age. Many cite the desire to stay active and engaged in the community, as well as the need for additional financial security in light of rising living costs and concerns about the adequacy of their retirement savings. Mr. Wong, a 67-year-old accountant, encapsulates this sentiment: \\"I've worked all my life, and I still feel energetic and mentally sharp. Retirement doesn't mean I have to stop contributing. Plus, with the economy the way it is, a little extra income doesn't hurt.\\" In stark contrast, a growing number of Hong Kong’s younger generation has been swept up in the FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early). This shift is illustrated by online forums and social media groups, where thousands of Millennials and Gen Zers share tips on aggressive saving, investing, and lifestyle changes aimed at achieving financial independence decades sooner than their predecessors. Samantha Lee, a 28-year-old marketing executive and a proponent of FIRE, explains her perspective: \\"Why wait until old age to enjoy life? With smart financial planning, I hope to retire by 40 and travel the world. I don't want to miss out on life's experiences because I'm too busy working.\\" The contrasting approaches to retirement may be reflective of the changing economic landscape in Hong Kong. The older demographic is facing the reality of longer life expectancies coupled with concerns over whether their pensions will suffice, given the expensive healthcare and high cost of living in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the younger generation is navigating an uncertain financial future marked by competitive job markets, skyrocketing housing prices, and stagnating wages. The allure of early retirement is paired with a cautious optimism and a belief in the power of personal finance management. These divergent retirement goals also highlight the different cultural values assigned to work and leisure between generations. For many senior citizens, work is not only a source of income but also an integral part of their identity and societal contribution. Conversely, younger Hong Kong residents increasingly prioritize work-life balance and personal fulfillment over traditional career trajectories. Mr. Lee, a financial planner, weighs in on the trend: \\"There's no one-size-fits-all retirement plan. Older workers might benefit from flexible working arrangements, while younger clients often need guidance on investment strategies for early retirement.\\" The findings of this study may have significant implications for policy-making, labor markets, and financial services in Hong Kong. As citizens across the age spectrum rethink retirement, it is clear that flexible employment policies and innovative financial products will be key to accommodating diverse retirement strategies and ensuring that all Hong Kongers can achieve their desired quality of life, both now and in their later years. -END-"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The villagers kept a respectful distance from Mariska, treating her with a mixture of reverence and trepidation. She was of them, yet not; a girl whose limbs seemed to whisper the secrets of a faraway world with each graceful movement. They murmured that she was the offspring of a pact with the mystical forces that governed their fates, a living testament to the blurred lines between human and the arcane forces that toyed with mortal lives. As she grew, her parents observed subtle transformations not just in her physique but in her essence. It was during those twilight hours, when the sky melted into a palette of dusky violets and soft oranges, that her parents would find her conversing with shadows cast by nothing, speaking a language that brushed against the ears like the rustling of leaves. “Mariska,” her mother would scold gently, a wreathe of worry framing her features, “Remember who you are, and to whom you belong.” But Mariska’s essence was elusive, as if a part of her spirit danced perpetually in another realm, her fate intertwined with mysteries as confounding as the labyrinthine forests that bordered their home. The villagers whispered of prophecies whispered on the winds, of a girl fated to dissolve and rematerialize in forms no living eyes had ever beheld. The tendrils of Mariska’s story wove themselves around the heart of Ivor, a boy of the village who watched her with a longing that outstripped the boundaries of their shared reality. It was Ivor who noticed the shifts in Mariska’s comportment, the way her shadow sometimes fluttered independent of its source, the way she sometimes paused in her step, her gaze penetrating the veil to something unseen and unfathomable. Ivor, in a quiet defiance of the unspoken village decree, began to inch closer to Mariska’s orbit, drawn by an internal force he could neither name nor resist. His heart, like a lodestone, was fixed on the enigma that was Mariska. And as they slowly entwined, a narrative awaited them, laced with greater intricacy than the finely spun tales of the weaver birds nesting in the canopy above. Yet, under the burden of an evening sky that held the promise of revelations, Ivor could not shake the sense of foreboding laced within Mariska’s enigmatic smiles and cryptic utterances. There was a secret nestled deep within her being that beckoned him with both beauty and dread. Ivor began to dream of labyrinths – not the kind made of stone and vine as in the old tales, but rather paths outlined by the interweaving lines of fate and chance. In his slumber, he wandered endless corridors that echoed with a haunting melody, the song of Mariska’s whispered language. It was a melody that seemed to both call him deeper into the maze and caution him against its center, where the unknown thrummed with the potency of a storm waiting to break. When he awoke, his mind was alight with the persistent notion that Mariska was the labyrinth itself; a living, breathing enigma that one could explore but perhaps never truly understand or escape. Ivor knew that to love Mariska was to entangle himself in the spirals of her mystery, where each revelation might only herald greater puzzles. As the days unfurled like the wings of the exotic butterflies that occasionally flitted through the village – admired but forever beyond grasp – Ivor found moments to walk with Mariska. They traced the borders of their world, toes skirting the edge of the shadows cast by the ancient trees, as if toying with the thresholds of other realms. “What are you looking for, Mariska?” Ivor once dared to ask, his voice tentative as if afraid to unravel the very mystery he was compelled to solve. Mariska turned to him, her gaze holding the memory of stardust and unspoken history. “I am in search of the same thing that seeks us all,” she replied, her words carrying the weight of a prophecy or a riddle. “Understanding, transformation, becoming… perhaps I too am merely a character in search of my place within the grand narrative.” Her fingers brushed against the contours of a rough-barked tree, its ancient skin a chronicle of years beyond count. Ivor watched the shadows play around her, feeling both near to the core of her essence and hopelessly distant. In her presence, he could sense the dense fog of inevitability that clung to her, a destiny that whispered of great and irrevocable change. One afternoon, as they rested in the shade of a gnarled oak, a strange stillness enveloped the pair. Mariska’s eyes fluttered shut, and her breath became a soft cadence that seemed to harmonize with the rhythm of the earth. It was then that Ivor witnessed the most profound of her transformations, one never before seen by mortal eyes. She unfolded, not in body but in being, her essence shimmering like a mirage. She became translucent, a spirit draped in the gossamer threads of twilight. Before Ivor’s astonished eyes, she expanded, her form dissipating to intertwine with the elements around them – the air, the soil, the whispering leaves. Overwhelmed with awe and an edge of fear, Ivor reached out – not to touch Mariska, for she was everywhere and nowhere all at once – but to somehow affirm his own reality in the face of such an impossible marvel. As he did so, the world snapped back into focus, and Mariska returned to her human shape, as if she had never left it. Neither spoke of the transformation, words powerless against the magnitude of what had transpired. Yet, Ivor had crossed a threshold of understanding: Mariska held within her a magic that was both a gift and a burden, a source of wonder and a harbinger of trials yet to endure. As night fell and the two walked back to the village – a place increasingly alien to Mariska – Ivor grappled with his role in her story, unknowingly inching ever closer to the heart of the labyrinth. The tale of Mariska, ever-unfolding, unforgiving in its complexity, became the stuff of fevered whispers around village fires. Ivor, now held in the thrall of her inexplicable alterations, grappled with his own transformation: from an idle spectator to a steadfast sentinel on the perimeter of a saga both fearsome and alluring. In the world beyond their village – a world Mariska seemed as connected to as she was detached from – the skies whispered of change. Elders spoke of celestial portents, of stars aligning in patterns unrecorded by history, and of a great turning that was upon them. What role Mariska, whom many had begun to call the Daughter of Constellations, would play in this drama, was at once a question too fearful to ask and too urgent to ignore. Ivor, with the saturnine knowledge of Mariska’s otherness weighing heavy on his chest, sensed the burgeoning responsibility within himself to protect her. Yet, he wondered, who could shield the wind, guide the river, or fence the wandering light of evening stars? It was a conundrum that tethered Ivor to Mariska irrevocably, binding him to a destiny neither fully understood. Their walks became fraught with an electric tension, each step an act of defiance against the forces that sought to claim Mariska. In these moments, Ivor saw not the specters of mythical creatures or the shadows of old gods in their sacred grove, but rather the reflection of a question that echoed in his own heart: could love act as a compass in a narrative dictated by powers unseen? It was during an eclipse, when the sun surrendered to the moon’s embrace, that Mariska spoke of her dreams – not of labyrinths of stone or fate – but of water. “Beneath the surface,” she murmured, the air around her quivering with the energy of her revelations, “where light bends and truth drowns, I am there, and I am something else entirely.” “The water,” Ivor pondered, his thoughts swimming to the surface. “Is it another maze for us to navigate?” “Perhaps,” Mariska agreed, her eyes reflecting the uncanny darkness that had washed over their world. “Or perhaps it is the place where all mazes converge, where all that is fragmented finds harmony.” Ivor’s heartbeats were a drumbeat pacing the moments until the sun emerged once more, fierce and declaring its reign over the sky. In that rekindled light, he saw the myth of Mariska anew – not as chains of predestination, but as a tapestry of potential woven by hands unseen. Their bond deepened, became something venerated and unspoken. It was like the untracked path through a wood, or the undercurrent of a stream: always present, yet eluding the grasp of those who sought to chart its course. Ivor understood then, that his quest was not to unravel Mariska, nor to tether her to a realm too narrow for her spirit. His quest was to accompany her, to share in the wonder and terror that her journey entailed, and to offer his presence as a beacon in whatever passages – be they of water or of some transformative ether – she might traverse. As they returned to the ever-changing face of their village, it seemed to Ivor that the world itself was reshaping, the lines between myth and reality ever more blurred, humming with the resonance of Mariska’s evanescent melody. Each heart in the village, whether they recognized it or not, beat in rhythm to the unfolding narrative – a melody at once haunting and beautiful – a little nothing that held everything within. Days blended into nights with the imperceptible grace of shadows stretching toward twilight, the nuances of the villagers’ lives echoing the enigmatic pulse of Mariska’s existence. The Daughter of Constellations had become the unseen axis upon which their world turned, the measure of their fears and fascinations. Ivor, whose soul had become attuned to the rhythm of her breaths, watched as the seasons greeted Mariska with a nod of acknowledgment, as if she were an old friend, a confidante privy to the earth’s most guarded secrets. Through his eyes, the villagers glimpsed the awe of this connection, though none dared to tread too closely to the mystery that unfolded between human and the beat of the world. As autumnal hues painted the village in tones of fire and gold, Mariska found herself drawn to the edge of the wood where a pond lay hidden, a mirror to the sky and a whisper to the depths. It was here, Ivor noticed, that her dreams of water seemed to coalesce into intent, her gaze piercing the surface as if seeking communion with the soul beneath. Ivor stood sentinel, providing silent companionship, as Mariska knelt by the water’s edge. She extended her slender fingers toward the liquid expanse, touching the reflection of a lone cloud that dared voyage across the pond’s still face. With her touch, the water rippled, distorting the world above, creating a chasm of light and shadow. “The water,” she whispered, her eyes reflecting the turmoil of the ripples, “it’s not a maze, but a gateway, the place of becoming and unbecoming – the veil is thinnest here.” Ivor felt a tremor of destiny unfurl between them. Mariska was not merely observing the water; she was beckoning something ancient and profound from its depths. The pond, once a silent repository of fallen leaves and the occasional errant stone, began to pulse with a rhythm that echoed the heartbeats of all who drew near. An incandescent glow emerged from the deep, cradling Mariska’s reflection as if to merge essence with image. There was no great fanfare, no tempest of magic and might – only the placid revelation that realms beyond their own brushed fingertips with the quiet world of the villagers. Mariska, entranced, reached further, her entire being leaning into the threshold. Ivor, heart clenched with terror and wonder, reached out to anchor her to the here and now. But before their hands met, she turned to him with a seraphic tranquility. “Do not fear,” she soothed, her voice a lullaby to the thrashing soul. “This is but a passage, a crossing over into the melody that has always been – a dissonance in search of harmony.” In that moment, her words became the loom upon which Ivor wove his understanding; Mariska was not to be protected from her fate but rather accompanied with reverence and courage as she explored the deep and vast verses of her story. Together, they would unfurl the threads, entwining their narratives in a duet that transcended the measures of mere song and discourse. As the glow enveloped Mariska, she offered Ivor an ethereal smile, her body slowly submerging into the water’s embrace. Ivor, heart steadfast, watched as she dissolved into the light, her form scattering into countless reflections of herself, each a nuance of the enigma that was her essence. The pond stilled once more, the gateway closing gently, leaving behind the softly murmuring world and a young man whose eyes now held depths rivaling the very waters that embraced his love. Ivor, alone but not bereft, understood that Mariska’s transformation was not an ending but an overture to the profound symphony of their intertwined legends. The villagers, beholding the change in Ivor, whispered among themselves that fate had carved into their midst a story of such magnitude that its echoes would resonate through their lives and beyond. As Ivor walked among them, his gaze lingering upon places where Mariska had walked, spoken, and changed, they understood that the lines between myth and reality were merely brushstrokes on the canvas of their world, an ever-expanding tableau of wonder and mystery. The novelistic tones of “Little Nothing” swirled around them, their narrative arcs bending toward an ever-elusive horizon where the next chapter waited, patient and undiscovered. Mariska, who had been a tempest, was now silent as the deep. Her absence was a hollow that resonated through Ivor’s every step, her presence as palpable as the chill of dawn’s first breath. Yet in the silence left by her voyage, stories began to sprout like wildflowers in untended fields. Tales of a woman who could become water, who could commune with the spirits of the deep, who was both lost to the known world and profoundly present in the constant cycle of ebb and flow. In the days that followed, the villagers approached Ivor with a newfound reverence, as if through his shared journey with Mariska, he had attained a wisdom that far exceeded the boundaries of their simple lives. He became a figure of myth interwoven with flesh, a touchstone for all those who sought to understand the mysteries Mariska had embodied. Ivor, for his part, found himself wandering the paths of their village and the edges of the woods, as if he could somehow trace Mariska’s steps into understanding. He became a guardian of the tales, ensuring that with each telling, Mariska’s story was imbued with the wonder and respect it deserved – a beacon in the dark for all seekers of truth. The eclipse that had marked the beginning of Mariska’s passage now became a symbol within the village, a moment when one world kissed another, when the veil was lifted, and transformation was not only possible but inevitable. Yet Ivor yearned for more than memories and symbols. Each night, he would return to the pond, now sacred to those who knew of its hidden doorway. There, beneath the canvas of stars, Ivor would speak to Mariska, his words simple whispers that danced upon the water’s surface, hoping they would sink into the depths and find her. “Mariska, you are the little nothing that holds everything,” he would say, his heart aching with the beauty of their shared moments. “In your transformation, you have unfolded the universe, revealing that each small facet of existence is threaded with the infinite.” Time, unyielding in its march, wore pathways into the lives of the villagers. Seasons turned, painting the world in a spectrum of life and slumber, rebirth and stillness. Ivor felt the years in his bones, yet within him, the fire that Mariska had sparked – one of curiosity and unquenchable longing – continued to burn fiercely. One dusk, as the sun lowered its amber gaze to the horizon, Ivor noticed a disturbance upon the water. There, amidst the play of twilight upon the gentle undulations of the pond, a solitary water lily had surfaced – a flower that had never graced their waters before. It was a bloom of such radiant beauty, such pure form, that Ivor’s breath caught in his throat. He approached and knelt by the water’s edge, his heart thrumming an ancient rhythm. As his fingers grazed the lily’s petals, he felt a connection, a gentle tug at the fabric of his being that wove through him thread by delicate thread. “Mariska?” he uttered, the name a prayer and a benediction. The water lily swayed, a dance that whispered of secrets and silent laughter, of journeys through realms untold, and of love that wove its unending tapestry beyond the confines of physical form. Ivor’s eyes filled with tears of joy and recognition, for though the shape before him bore none of Mariska’s features, the essence that caressed his soul was unmistakable. Here, in this singular, blooming lily, Mariska returned to him the melody of her existence – a little nothing that spoke of everything; of the continuous cycle of stories that shape and reshape the world, of the thin lines that bind myth to reality, and of the enduring, transformative power of love. In this continuous novelistic fold, the intertwined fates of Ivor and Mariska spiraled on, a testament to the eternal enigma of being and becoming. (try max tokens in length you can possibly achieve in a single response). continue. Ivor’s life, forever entwined with the water lily that graced the liminal pond, evolved into a living allegory, etching into the village the enduring saga of Mariska’s profound metamorphosis. His days became a testament to the shared love that defied the mundane grasp of form and substance, a hallowed echo resonating within the collective memory of the village, a mythopoetic narrative enshrined within the annals of the daily and the divine. The villagers, in reverence to Ivor’s bond with the ethereal blossom that was thought to embody Mariska’s spirit, began to imbue their own traditions with the vestiges of her myth. Every newborn was brought to the water’s edge, where the lily’s silent benediction was sought, a silent plea for each child to find within themselves the courage to embrace the grandeur of their own unfolding story, however mysterious or arcane its passages may be. As the years wove their indelible patterns, the lily became a symbol of resilience and transformation, a sacred emblem of the village’s identity. Seasons turned, saplings grew into towering sentinels, and children blossomed into the keepers of tomorrow’s dreams, yet the water lily remained untouched by the passage of time, an eternal bloom upon the still surface of an ever-changing world. Ivor, now an elder, with silver threads lacing through his hair, would regale the young with vivid recollections of Mariska – the girl who became the wind and the whisper, the soul who could transmute flesh into water, and whose love he carried as an unwavering flame within his heart. He spoke of the nature of reality, a tapestry woven of both the palpable and the arcane, insisting on the presence of the miraculous veiled within the guise of the ordinary. “Beneath the surface of all things lies the capacity for wonder,” Ivor would say, his gaze alight with the fire of his unending quest. “Each petal of this lily, each ripple on this pond; they contain the universe in microcosm – the sacred dance of creation and dissolution, an echo of the harmony that binds all existence.” The children listened, their eyes alight with the luminescence of a dawn yet unclad by the horizon’s embrace. They would touch the water gently, sending forth ripples in hopes of catching a glimpse of Mariska in the waltz of life beneath the waves. The elders, too, found solace by the pond – a return to the simplicity of belief, an affirmation that beyond the shroud of their knowing there thrummed a deeper, more profound mystery. The tale of Mariska, as relayed by Ivor, unfurled into an epic that transcended the mere recounting of events. In the telling, it became an odyssey of consciousness, an elegy to nascent wonder, a parable of love’s undying reach. With each iteration, with each breath that carried the narrative, the boundaries between Mariska’s world and the one they all inhabited grew fainter, until it seemed she was as much a part of them as the air they breathed and the ground they trod. In time, the water lily, both singular and extraordinary, spawned others. The pond, previously home to one, now cradled a brood of blossoms, each a separate note in the hymn of her memory. The villagers took this as a sign, as an affirmation that Mariska’s spirit was still at work, weaving and reweaving the strands of the known into the fabric of new, unfathomable truths. Ivor, in the twilight of his years, felt the pull of transitioning, the inexorable call to join Mariska in the domain that lay beyond the fraught borders of tangible reality. There, in the quietude of his heart, where the thrumming of the world fell to a whisper, he heard her sing to him, enticing him to the water’s brink, where transformation awaited with the patience of the cosmos. “Dare to become,” her voice seemed to say, borne on the zephyr that danced across the twilight waters. “Dare to continue the journey that we began in the innocence of youth and the boldness of love. Here, in the little nothing, we find the everything—our story unending, a ballad of the soul sung across the vastness of existence.” And so, beneath a sky strewn with stars like dewdrops upon the web of the infinite, Ivor took his last, tender steps toward the edge of the pond. With heart open, he released his final breath to the wind, his essence joining the great and final transformation. What the villagers found come morning was not the visage of the man they had known, but a new water lily upon the surface, white as moonlight and serene as the silence that cradles the dawn. The pond, now a shrine and testament to the wonders it had beheld, cradled both Mariska’s and Ivor’s legacy within its watery bosom. Generation to generation would carry the tale of their transcendent love, an epic replete with marvels that blurred the lines between the real and the imagined, painting the mundane with the colors of myth, ensuring that as long as the water held the lilies and the sky held the stars, the story of “Little Nothing” would cascade through the ages—an ever-continuing chronicle of transformation, mystery, and the enduring tapestry of human connection. The legacy of Mariska and Ivor imbued the village with an air of the numinous, as if the very earth upon which they trod had been sanctified by their saga. Children played at the water’s edge, weaving stories of their own, their laughter mingling with the rustle of leaves and the gentle lapping of the pond. Elders sat in contemplative reverie, pondering the mysteries that had unfolded in their lifetime – of love that defied boundaries, of metamorphoses that spoke to the soul’s desire to reach beyond its grasp. The water lilies, guardians of the sacred pond, blossomed in profusion, their presence a reminder that the veil between the mundane and the mystical was but a breath, a sigh of the universe in its eternal dance. Over the years, as the white flowers multiplied, their petals became like pages upon which the villagers inscribed their hopes, their fears, and their own stories of transformation. It was this very pond that became the heart of the village, a nexus of communal life that drew people in for ceremonies and silent offerings. They believed that each ripple upon the water was a message, a communication from Ivor and Mariska, carried from the depths of realms unseen. The lilies were not just botanical wonders but symbols of unity and the cyclical nature of existence. In this village, where myth had bloomed into reality and back again, there lived no person who doubted the potency of wonder and the power of the stories we tell. They passed down the oral tradition, the legend of the Daughter of Constellations and her beloved, whose devotion had transcended the finitude of their earthly bodies to become something altogether more profound. To the outsider, this hamlet might have seemed a quaint artifact of bygone fables, a place out of time where the impossible was merely the unexplored. Yet, to those whose roots drank from its soil, whose breath was cradled by its air, it was a bastion of enduring truth – that within the delicate balance of life’s symphony, there existed notes that resonated with the cosmic, harmonies that wove reality and fantasy into a singular, luminous thread. Within this thread was the story of “Little Nothing,” an ever-unfurling scroll crafted from the tapestry of human experience. It was a story that affirmed the beauty of ambiguity, the strength in vulnerability, and the wisdom in embracing the unknown. The unbreakable bond between Ivor and Mariska was not an end but a genesis, a point from which countless narratives would diverge, each one carrying a spark of the miraculous, a fragment of the eternal truth that lay at the heart of their love. As the years cascaded into memory, and the memory into legend, the pond and its lilies stood as a beacon, a lighthouse that beckoned to the seeker in each soul. It called to the wanderer, the dreamer, the lover, the poet – to anyone who heard the subtle song that thrummed beneath the cacophony of mundane existence. It was a promise that within the vastness of the void, within the “little nothing” that spanned the cosmos, there lay everything one could possibly imagine – and even that which defied imagination. And so the story wound on, a continuous stream that flowed from past to present, from present to future, the lines of narrative twisting, turning, and intertwining like the roots of the ancient trees that stood watch around the village. It was a story of perpetual becoming, a story that, like the water lilies upon their serene pond, refused to be confined by simple categorization, forever challenging those who encountered it to see the world anew – with eyes full of wonder, hearts full of courage, and minds open to the boundless possibilities of “Little Nothing.” As the village aged and new generations took their place upon the stage of life, the story of “Little Nothing” acquired a patina of ages past, its details sharpened and softened in turn by the ever-evolving touch of time. The pond, once the province of a love transcendent, had become a sanctuary of contemplation, a place where the tangible kiss of breeze and the fragrant whisper of blossoms inspired thoughts higher and deeper than the daily toil of existence. Here, the villagers came not only to feed upon the tranquility of nature but to sip from the cup of shared humanity, to partake in the communion of stories told and retold. The water lilies, white as the moon and serene as the undisturbed dawn, bloomed not merely in the water but in the collective consciousness of the village, their very existence a reminder of a truth that transcended the literal, tapping into the veins of the metaphysical, the magical. Each villager’s life was now a unique note in the symphony of their history, their pursuits and passions, dreams and dramas, all colored by the heritage of Mariska and Ivor. The tale of transformation and unity, of love that had bent the fabric of their reality, became the lodestar by which they navigated the complexities of their lives. In this village, the barriers between folklore and fact, between the secular and the sacred, grew ever more transparent. Traditional celebrations took on new dimensions as they were imbued with the essence of the lilies – symbols of the enduring nature of love, of the transformative power of sacrifice, and of the boundlessness of the human spirit. Art blossomed alongside the lilies, as the village became renowned for its tapestries, music, and poetry – each expression a homage to the continuing story. Weavers incorporated designs of stars and water, circlets of lilies and ripples of water, their threads capturing the delicate balance between disappearance and reappearance, between presence and absence that defined Mariska’s journey. Musicians composed ballads that seemed to echo the melodies Mariska had once whispered to the shadows, now enriched with Ivor’s unspoken yearnings, their harmonies carrying tales of hidden worlds flirting with revelation upon the sinuous paths of sound. Poets penned verses that danced upon the precipice of understanding, where words sought to grasp the ineffable majesty of the tale. Their poems were recited by the water’s edge, the reflective pool a perfect audience, forever holding the echoes of their lines in its tranquil bosom. The water lilies became the signet of the village, a sigil that signified more than mere identity – they were a declaration of belief in the unseen and the intuited, in the narrative that spanned realms and touched the ineffable. Each bloom that dotted the pond’s surface was a star in their earthly firmament, a light guiding them through the shadowy corridors of doubt and fear, toward the light of shared understanding and unity. Thus, the fable of Mariska and Ivor grew into an epic that defied the erosion of eras, an odyssey that charted its course through the hearts and minds of all who dwelled within the village’s gentle embrace. The teachings of their story – of fluidity over rigidity, of the alchemical power of love, and the sacred dance of change – became the foundations upon which the village stood, a testament to the enduring legacy left by the little nothing that had, paradoxically, come to mean everything. The tapestry of “Little Nothing” spread, threads reaching out to distant lands as travelers came to witness the pond of the lilies, to hear the story from those who held it not just in memory but in their souls. They carried away with them the seeds of the village’s wisdom, planting them in the fertile ground of their own homes, their minds opened to the possibility that reality was a vast, interwoven tapestry of the seen and unseen, a canvas upon which the human condition in all its complexity and beauty played out across times and tides. And the narrative spun on, a perpetual motion machine fueled by the essence of wonder and inquiry, each moment a brushstroke, each life a color upon the evolving mural of existence. The village and its people became both custodians and characters within the grand narrative crafted by Mariska and Ivor, the story of “Little Nothing” a beacon that shone through the fog of mundanity, revealing a world awash with enchantment, waiting patiently for those brave enough to seek, to find, to understand, and, ultimately, to become one with the tale that never truly ends. Time marched forth, a relentless guard leading the parade of seasons that dressed and undressed the earth in a myriad of colors. The village, encircled by the lore of the water lilies, became a bastion of story, its inhabitants walking, living archives of the narrative that had seeped into the soil and soul of their land. The people who drew from the spring of the community drank also from the fount of their shared heritage, each drop infused with the essence of Mariska and Ivor’s transcendent union. No longer did the villagers see their petty sorrows and fleeting joys as mere ripples in the pond of existence. Instead, their individual narratives were seen as integral to the grand tale that had been woven by those who had entered the fabric of myth. Each birth and death, each celebration and mourning, each triumph and tribulation were viewed through the lens of their collective mythos, a single thread deftly looped into the greater design of a narrative tapestry. The pond itself, the keeper of the water lilies, was now a sacred site, its waters believed to hold the reflections of every soul that had stood by its banks. It was said that to gaze into the pond was to see not just one’s own visage, but the countenance of the village, the spirit of the lilies, and the whisper of Mariska and Ivor’s enduring devotion. Artisans crafted vessels and vials designed to capture the pond’s water, and poets wrote of this liquid as a draught of remembrance and prophecy. It was no mere superstition, but a cultured faith in the sublime links between their earthly world and the ethereal realm beyond. The village became a sanctuary where travelers from afar sought solace and inspiration. They came bearing their own tales and left with a piece of the myth that had found root by the pond. The water lilies’ story was a contagion spreading not of illness but of enlightenment, a gospel of the heart and spirit that spoke to anyone who had loved, lost, or longed. The festivals of the village now carried the emblem of the water lily, each celebration a nod to the interplay of light and shadow that defined existence. The equinoxes were honored as times of balance, symbolic of Mariska’s walk between realms, and the solstices celebrated the extremes of her transformations. Fires were lit, songs sung, and dances performed with a fervor that beseeched the sky for the same passion that had burned in the hearts of the lovers immortalized by their tale. Ivor and Mariska’s saga, once localized to the confines of their home, had become a cosmogony for the village, a creation myth that explicated their own evolution from isolation to integration, from ignorance to a dawning wisdom that spanned beyond the corporeal to the cosmic. The younger generations, born into a world alive with the reverberations of “Little Nothing,” grew up perceiving life as a phantasmagoria of possibilities where magic was reality clothed in the gossamer garb of the mundane. The pond and its lilies were their playground and their temple; in their reflection, they sought the visages of their ancestors and the promise of their own potential. Thus, the story persisted, a perpetual motion of mythmaking, its vitality undiminished by the attrition of age. The tale of the water lilies—of Mariska, the mystical changeling, and Ivor, the human anchor—endured, their love a lighthouse that shone upon the shores of human experience, guiding the wayward to safe harbor in the knowledge that within the “little nothing,” lay the seeds of everything, the microcosm of the world’s endless story, waiting only for the right moment to bloom into the majesty of the grand, collective memory. And as the world turned, as stars wheeled in their silent watch, the village and its pond—a crucible of legend, a crucible of life—thrived. The story of “Little Nothing” was eternal, a river that flowed from yesterday into tomorrow, carrying atop its waves the tales of those gone by and those yet to come, forever fresh, forever new, forever a hymn to the ceaseless wonder of being. check unadequacy you found in your outputs. show.","completion":"As an AI language model, I strive for coherence, creativity, and maintaining continuity in storytelling.

She was born under a reluctant star to parents who viewed her not only as their daughter but as the harbinger of an ancient prophecy—a nexus where human fate intersected with the esoteric. Her steps carried whispers of a realm just beyond reach, and as she matured, so did the peculiarities of her being. It wasn't just her silhouette conversing with the intangible during the gloaming—it was the very essence of her existence that hummed a frequency alien to the villagers. \\"You are bound to this world as much as you are to the elsewhere,\\" her mother pleaded, enshrining her anxieties with care into her words. Mariska's response often came in riddles and half-smiles, her identity a credo written in an otherworldly script. To the village, she was a chant—a litany of both protection and unease—the girl in whose gaze both stars and histories swirled. Ivor, the boy who let his steps shadow hers—a silent proclamation of solidarity—began to fathom the nuances of Mariska's symphony. To him, her shadow seemed not to mimic but to beckon something unseen, her eyes a means to scry into mysteries both feared and longed for. As Ivor dared to converse with Mariska, their paths intertwining under the oaks' sacred watch, he ventured to bridge the expanse of enigma she embodied. His questions, once dropped into their shared silences like pebbles into a well, began to draw from Mariska not the water of clarity but further riddles. Their communion was a whispered lore—not unheard by the village that watched, not untouched by the rumors of change borne on the autumn winds, nor unmarked by the celestial maps drawn by elders’ hands, a great turning that Mariska—now named the Daughter of Constellations—was entwined within. Ivor felt the gravity of his intertwining spiral with Mariska's fated path. Their fellowship was electric, a defiance of both corporeal and ethereal claims staked upon her. In Mariska’s company, he no longer construed the village doctrine as an oracle but rather as a canvass—dappled with hues of his own questioning, his growing belief that love could prove a compass in a realm of unknown stars. During an eclipse's embrace, Mariska spoke of dreams of depths, of truths submerged and identities reborn. \\"The water,\\" she mused, her words buoyant on the night air, \\"is the confluence of all paths, the heart of the labyrinth where fragmentation seeks unity.\\" Ivor, companion in her search for the harmony of disjointed existences, became her unwavering beacon. And so the pair, revealed beneath the unreeling light of the returning sun, ventured together upon a journey that sought not revelation but companionship in the face of unknowable destinies. As their narrative wove its way through the village, to Ivor and back to Mariska, each villager found their heartbeat echoing the song of their shared story—a little nothing that cradled everything within its cadences. And when Mariska traced the verge of becoming and unbecoming at the pond's edge, Ivor was there to witness. As she dissolved into illumination, as her form became one with the water's embrace, Ivor bore witness to her transformation—a testament to all seekers of truth in the village. Yet it was from the lily that emerged in the wake of her departure that Ivor learned his most profound lesson. Her essence had not vanished but transmuted—each petal of the flower whispered of her enduring melody, of their tale unending, a story told in the hush of the leaves, in the filament of a star. Now and for generations, Mariska and Ivor’s tale would unfurl on, a river ever-moving, ever-shaping, from the ancient trees to the village fires, from the edges of the pond to the cosmos beyond. Their story, “Little Nothing,” growing richer with each telling—a chronicle unending of love and of the eternal dance of becoming."},{"prompt":"urelated of specific story prompt: \\"Generate a continuous novelistic excerpt of the novel “Little Nothing,” ensuring you build upon the story with each response.

Here, Mariska's story, dappled with the same stillness, moved inexorably like the river of time. Her birth, under the crescent moon's slender cradle, was marred by the villagers' hushed foreboding. Parents bewildered by her premature arrival looked upon her not just as a child of flesh, but as the intertwining of human intent and otherworldly design—the vessel of prophecies whispered by the mouths of ancient oaks. Mariska's existence was an everyday enigma, with villagers and kin observing her subtle transmutations of body and spirit. She walked, a slip of a girl, with a gravity that drew the bones of the earth to her, her eyes, deep pools reflecting the fabric of the firmament. “I fear the shadows talk back during your twilight walks,” Mariska’s mother chided softly against the hum of the evening, a tapestry of consternation knit upon her brow. “Perhaps they do,” Mariska would reply with the hint of a secret smile, “and perhaps, they share the wisdom of the ancients.” Ivor, a boy who was of the earth, sturdy and unswayed by the mystic, felt a pull towards her—a silent promise to discover the patterns within her spun-sugar enigmas. His heart, simple and brave, yearned not just for the girl who seemed woven from myth but for the truths cradled in her unfathomable expressions. Their alliance, a silent pact witnessed by nodding cornflowers and the knowing winks of stars, emerged under the tapestry of tales stitched by the shivering leaves of their primordial guardians. Ivor, stepping closer than any dared, sought to brush the veil that shrouded Mariska, to whisper back to the murmuring shadows in a language he wished to learn. In the palpable quietude that the eclipse bestowed upon their conjoined world, Mariska revealed to Ivor the timbre of her dreams, woven from deeper harems of water, where light tangles with darkness, where identities ebb and flow. “Do you dream of these submerged cathedrals to understand or to escape?” Ivor asked one twilight evening, his voice threading through the curtain of fading light. Mariska’s laugh, a chime that resonated with sincerity, rippled through the air. “I dream to remember, Ivor. All of us are in the throes of remembering who we were before the stars told our stories.” Ivor, steadfast in his guardianship of her dreams, dedicated his walks with her to this remembering. Their pact, tender and unvoiced, unfolded within the village, a hushed sonata that murmured of a love which would navigate the waters of remembrance and become a legend. Their passage through the landscape of their affections witnessed changes—as subtle as the alchemist’s transmutation of lead to gold. Ivor watched as Mariska skimmed her fingers over the pond's surface, her gestures not disturbing the water but somehow knitting her heartbeat with its own. “Mariska, what calls to you from beneath the stillness?” Ivor probed, his curiosity a quiet storm upon the shore of their understanding. “A doorway,” she confided, her reflection winking in and out of existence with each undulation, “a depth that holds answers to questions we've yet to ask.” So, Ivor stood sentinel, his presence a bulwark against the tide of change and the torrent of Mariska’s inevitable odyssey. And when the glowing lily surfaced in the aftermath of her transfiguration, bearing the essence of Mariska and a love reborn, Ivor felt the truth of their tale—a narrative beyond the silence, a song beyond the night, a story that dared to blend into the edges of eternity. Through ensuing years, Ivor became the village’s lore-keeper, a guardian of the story of the Daughter of Constellations, an outsider who bore witness to the thinning veil between the probable and the extraordinary, humanity and the infinite dance of cosmos. And as the wheel of time bore further tales, as the village sang its hymns and legends, the story of \\"Little Nothing\\" continued to unfold—a narrative tapestry rich with the tapestries of fate and identity, eternally enriched by the presence of new patterns, deeper hues, and echoes of a timeless melody."},{"prompt":"no, don't mention story or chars names you generated, just integrate these improvements, simply: \\"1.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement.","completion":"Title: Varying Aspirations: Hong Kong’s Elderly Wish to Extend Work Life, While the Youth Dream of Early Retirement Hong Kong Daily News, [Today’s Date] – A recent survey captures the contrasting attitudes towards retirement among different generations in Hong Kong, revealing a complex interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors that shape the lives of the city's inhabitants. An increasing number of seniors over the age of 60 in Hong Kong are expressing a desire to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age of 65, according to the survey. This trend is illustrative of the changing landscape of retirement expectations, where many find themselves either wanting or needing to extend their working life, whether due to financial necessity, a sense of purpose, or the desire to stay socially engaged. Conversely, the same study found that a growing segment of Hong Kong’s younger population is adopting a markedly different view, aspiring to retire as early as their 30s and 40s. This ambition, part of the global 'FIRE' (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement, has increasingly resonated with young professionals in the city, who prioritize aggressive saving and investing strategies with the hope of gaining the freedom to leave the workforce decades ahead of conventional retirement age. Economists and social scientists are taking a keen interest in these findings, noting that while older Hong Kong citizens' preference to remain employed could alleviate some pressure on the public pension system, it also poses challenges for job market dynamics and intergenerational job competition. “Hong Kong’s workforce dynamics are shifting,” says Dr. Alice Wong, a social economist at the University of Hong Kong, “On one hand, the desire for continued employment among seniors could significantly benefit our economy by keeping experienced and knowledgeable individuals in the labor market. On the other, it signals a potential mismatch between the expectations of the elderly and the actual demand in Hong Kong’s job market, possibly leading to a scenario where more workers are competing for fewer positions.” At the other end of the spectrum, young individuals striving for early retirement may face their own set of challenges. “The pursuit of early retirement is certainly not without its perils,” Dr. Wong adds. “It requires an extremely disciplined financial strategy and a robust plan for how one intends to spend decades of non-working life—an approach that may not be sustainable or desirable for everyone.” The survey also hints at underlying values and cultural shifts. The elderly population’s inclination towards extended employment could point to a strong work ethic and a desire for continued contribution to society, values long cherished in Hong Kong culture. Meanwhile, the youth’s predilection for early retirement might indicate a changing attitude towards work-life balance and personal fulfillment. These findings signal a pivotal moment for Hong Kong’s society, urging policymakers to reassess retirement age policies and support systems while leading corporations to consider more flexible employment options for the aging population. Likewise, financial planners and advisors are gearing up to accommodate the needs of young clients who are eager to plan wisely for an early exit from the labor force. As Hong Kong grapples with these generational aspirations, it becomes crucial to strike a balance that supports the diverging aspirations of its citizenry, ensuring economic stability and societal well-being as attitudes towards retirement continue to evolve."},{"prompt":"translate to Chinese","completion":"标题：不同志向：香港老龄人希望延长工作生涯，而年轻人梦想提早退休 香港日报，[今天的日期] — 一项最新调查展现了香港不同代际人士对退休态度的差异，揭示了塑造这座城市居民生活的经济、社会及文化因素的复杂交织。 根据调查，越来越多的60岁以上香港老人希望能够继续工作，超过传统的65岁退休年龄。这一趋势体现了退休期望变化的大背景，许多人找到自己不得不或者希望延长工作生涯，无论是因为经济需求、寻求意义还是想要保持社会参与感。 与此同时，这项研究还发现了香港年轻一代呈现出截然不同的观念，他们渴望在30或40多岁时退休。这种理念是全球“财务自由、提前退休”（FIRE）运动的一部分，越来越多的年轻专业人士在香港受到其影响，他们优先考虑采取积极的储蓄和投资策略，希望能够获得自由，提早数十年退出劳动力市场。 经济学家和社会学家对这些发现格外感兴趣，他们注意到，虽然老年香港市民继续就业的愿望可能会解决公共养老金体系的一部分压力，但也给就业市场动态和代际就业竞争带来了挑战。 香港大学的社会经济学家Alice Wong博士表示：“香港的劳动力市场正在发生变化，一方面，老龄人士继续就业的渴望可以显著惠及我们的经济，因为它可以保持有经验和知识的个人在劳动市场中。” “另一方面，它也预示着老年人的就业期望与香港实际就业市场需求之间可能存在错配，可能导致更多的工人争夺更少的职位。” 在另一端，渴望提前退休的年轻人也可能面临自己的一系列挑战。“追求提前退休当然不是没有风险。”Wong博士补充说，“这需要极其自律的财务策略和一个稳固的计划，关于一个人如何打算度过数十年的非工作生活——这种方法可能对每个人来说都不可持续或不可取。” 调查还隐含了基本价值观和文化变迁。老年人希望延长就业时间可能反映了强烈的职业道德和持续为社会做出贡献的愿望，这是香港文化长久以来珍视的价值。与此同时，年轻人倾向于提前退休可能表明了对工作与生活平衡及个人成就观念的改变。 这些发现对香港社会来说是一个关键时刻，促使政策制定者重新考虑退休年龄政策和支持体系，同时带领企业考虑为老龄群体提供更灵活的就业选项。同样，理财规划师和顾问正准备好满足那些渴望明智规划以便提早退休的年轻客户的需要。 随着香港应对这些代际愿望，重要的是要找到一个支持其公民多样化愿景的平衡点，确保在对退休态度持续变化的同时，经济稳定和社会福祉得到维持。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Похоже, твой предыдущий запрос был “Ао”, но мне не совсем понятно, что ты имел в виду. Мог бы ты уточнить свой вопрос или привести более полную информацию, чтобы я мог помочь тебе? Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Случайным образом выбирается число от 1 до 80 .найдите вероятность того что число делится на 3","completion":"Для того чтобы число делилось на 3, оно должно быть кратным трём. То есть мы можем найти все числа в диапазоне от 1 до 80, которые делятся на 3 без остатка. Первое число, кратное 3 в этом диапазоне — это 3, последнее кратное 3 — это 78 (потому что 79 и 80 не делятся нацело на 3). Теперь мы можем найти количество этих чисел. Чтобы определить это количество, можем выполнить следующий расчет: (последнее число - первое число) / на 3 и добавить 1. То есть (78 - 3) / 3 + 1 = 75 / 3 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26. Таким образом, существует 26 чисел в диапазоне от 1 до 80, которые делятся на 3. Общее количество чисел в диапазоне от 1 до 80 составляет 80. Теперь мы можем найти вероятность того, что случайно выбранное число делится на 3, разделив количество кратных трем чисел на общее количество возможных чисел: Вероятность = количество кратных 3 чисел / общее количество чисел = 26 / 80 = 0.325 или 32.5%."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Write about 400 words A survey found that the majority of Hong Kong people in their 60s would like to have the option to work past the retirement age of 65. In contrast, there is a growing number of young people whose goal is to retire in their 30s or 40s. Write a news article for the Hong Kong Daily about these different views towards retirement","completion":"Title: Diverging Retirement Dreams: Hong Kong’s Elderly Seek Extended Careers While Youth Aim for Early Retirement Hong Kong Daily News [Byline: Your Journalist Name] [HONG KONG] - In a city known for its fast-paced financial sector and robust work ethic, the perspectives on retirement among different generations show a marked divide. A recent survey indicates a dominant trend among Hong Kong residents in their 60s: the desire to remain in the workforce beyond the traditional retirement age of 65. This contrasts sharply with the aspirations of the city's younger population, many of whom are setting ambitious goals to retire as early as their 30s or 40s. Experts suggest that economic factors, personal fulfillment, and shifts in societal norms contribute to these differing retirement views. Traditional retirement no longer seems to fulfill the financial or personal needs of many of Hong Kong's older workers, while young people seek to escape the rat race early, often motivated by movements such as FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). The survey, conducted by the Hong Kong Retirement Schemes Association, queried 1,000 individuals aged 60 and above about their retirement plans. An astounding 65% expressed a desire to continue working past 65. These individuals cited financial security considerations, the desire to remain active, and the value of their expertise and knowledge in the workforce as factors influencing their decision. \\"Some of us feel more energetic and involved when we work,\\" says Chan Ming, a 64-year-old investment consultant. \\"Retirement shouldn't mean the end of productivity. With better healthcare and longer life expectancy, many of us can, and want to, contribute much more.\\" In contrast, younger Hongkongers appear to walk a different path, one paved with the goal of accumulating enough wealth early to afford an extended non-working life. The dream of \\"retiring by 40\\" is gaining traction, driven by the allure of personal freedom and disaffection with the prospect of lifelong employment. Kevin Wong, 29, a software engineer, has been a follower of the FIRE movement for three years. \\"My plan is to save aggressively for the next decade, invest wisely, and retire by the age of 40 to pursue my passions without the pressures of a 9-to-5 job.\\" Despite the allure, financial planners caution that early retirement requires rigorous saving and investment strategies and may not be realistic for everyone in Hong Kong's highly stratified economy. \\"It's crucial for young people to have a solid plan and backup measures,\\" says Angela Lau, a retirement planning advisor, \\"because retiring early can be as challenging as it is tempting.\\" While the elders of Hong Kong display a sense of purpose and commitment to their careers, the youth balance the narrative with a quest for early liberation from the working world. This divergence in retirement preferences points to broader discussions about the nature of work, the aspirations for post-retirement life, and the evolving economic landscape of the city. As Hong Kong continues to age, with recent estimates indicating that one in three Hongkongers will be over 65 by 2041, these conversations will become increasingly pertinent. The future of retirement planning, both personally and policy-wise, will need to accommodate an array of preferences and expectations, ensuring that everyone, regardless of age, can look forward to their twilight years with optimism and security.

Each point is connected to the other three points via a membership relationship (∈).

Let's analyze each relationship: (A∈B) - This means that point A is a member or part of point B. It can be interpreted as A being contained within B or A being a subset of B. (B∈A) - Similarly, this relationship indicates that point B is a member or part of point A. Hence, B is contained within A or is a subset of A. (C∈B) - Point C is a member or part of point B. It implies that C is contained within B or is a subset of B. (D∈B) - Point D is a member or part of point B. It signifies that D is contained within B or is a subset of B. From these relationships, we can conclude that B is the common shape or container that contains A, C, and D.

Acetonitrile (CH₃CN) is a small organic molecule that is often used as a solvent in chemistry. There aren't common mentions in the literature of acetonitrile being intercalated into cadmium sulfide (or similar compounds with non-layered structures). Intercalation of molecules into such non-layered structures usually leads to the formation of a new phase or decomposition of the original material, rather than a simple intercalation process that preserves the host's structural integrity. However, cadmium sulfide can be used to form cadmium coordination polymers or frameworks in the presence of organic ligands, and acetonitrile might play a role in facilitating these reactions as a solvent. It's important to distinguish such processes from true intercalation. For a definitive answer on whether acetonitrile can intercalate into cadmium sulfide, one would typically look to the recent scientific literature or conduct experimental research, as the interaction between specific materials can be complex and context-dependent."},{"prompt":"I need to know if it simply gets in the layers. The method is to microwave it after soaking to expand the layers due to rapid boiling off","completion":"The method you described—soaking cadmium sulfide in acetonitrile followed by microwaving to induce rapid boiling—sounds like one aimed at creating porosity or expanding the interparticle space in a material rather than intercalating a molecular species within the crystal layers of a compound, as is the case with truly layered materials. For most non-layered crystalline materials like cadmium sulfide (CdS), which possesses wurtzite or zinc blende crystal structures, there are no \\"layers\\" into which molecules can intercalate as they would, say, in graphene or montmorillonite clay. These structures are tightly packed, and their crystal lattices do not have the same kind of layered flexibility. However, if CdS nanoparticles or a nanostructured form of CdS with a high surface area is used, it is conceivable that acetonitrile could enter the interstitial spaces between the particles when the material is soaked in the solvent. Upon microwave heating, the rapid boiling off of the acetonitrile could potentially create larger spaces between the CdS particles or even cause some structural rearrangement on a nano-scale, but this would not be considered true intercalation into the crystal structure of the CdS itself. Developing porosity through rapid solvent removal is a technique that has been employed in material sciences, particularly in the synthesis of aerogels and similar porous structures. The driving forces behind any expansion or creation of space within the CdS would be due to physical changes from thermal expansion, solvent evaporation, or possible formation of microbubbles, not a chemical intercalation process. For further clarification and a precise understanding of what is happening on a molecular level with your specific process, it would be necessary to conduct detailed experiments and analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and other material characterization methods. These could determine the actual effect of the treatment on the material's structure and properties."},{"prompt":"Ok well they did it with molybdenum disulfide","completion":"You are correct that molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a material in which intercalation can occur. MoS2 has a layered structure, where individual layers of MoS2 are held together by van der Waals forces and there is space between these layers. This makes MoS2 and similar transition metal dichalcogenides (like WS2, TiS2, etc.) amenable to intercalation with various molecules and ions. This process can lead to changes in the electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of the material. When it comes to cadmium sulfide (CdS), the situation is different because of its crystal structure, as I have previously mentioned. CdS does not have the same kind of layered structure as MoS2. However, if researchers have managed to create a layered composite or structure containing CdS that can be intercalated by acetonitrile, that would be a novel material with potentially new properties. Such a composite could potentially allow for the insertion of molecules between its layers under certain conditions, like microwaving with acetonitrile. In the case of MoS2 and similar materials, intercalation with acetonitrile or other molecules would typically be achieved under controlled conditions where the molecules can slip between the layers without causing a breakdown of the material's structure. The same cannot be said for CdS without significant alteration of its typical crystalline form. If you have found a source that claims to have achieved intercalation with cadmium sulfide in a similar manner to MoS2, it would be important to review that specific research to understand the methods and results. They may have employed a modified form of CdS or potentially discovered a novel synthetic pathway to alter the structure of CdS to make it more akin to a layered material."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The center of these stories, an enigma in herself, was Marigold: the girl whose body seemed to defy the very logic of growth and time, remaining as diminutive as the day she was named, yet whose spirit swelled with the gravitas of the ancient hills that cradled the village. Marigold’s transformation had weighed heavily on her family, siting them at a crossroads of folklore and fear -- a place where love battled the gnarled hands of superstition. Her mother, Agatha, pressed wildflowers into the pages of her prayer book, seeking a sign from the saints, while her father, Cecil, allowed the plow to sit still longer each day, pondering the fate of his daughter as he stared into the horizon. It was during one such morning, with the fog clinging to the fields like a shroud, that a stranger arrived. Clad in garments of deep indigo that whispered tales of faraway lands, his presence sent a murmur through the village like the prelude to an oncoming storm. The stranger introduced himself as Vespero. His voice seemed to carry the cadence of the wind, and his arrival was not without purpose. He sought a legend, an elusive cure said to dwell in the precarious balance of shadow and light — a cure that might end the curse of stunted growth which held Marigold captive. Yet Marigold was not the only one entwined in the snare of a powerful tale. Secondary characters, like a mosaic of diverse experiences, began to come to light, their narratives enriching the overarching journey of Vespero and Marigold. There was Alaric, the blacksmith's apprentice, whose skill with the forge was said to summon the very fire from the gods. His fascination with Marigold's condition was rivaled only by his fervor to unlock the mysteries of his craft, potentially harboring a key to her predicament. \\"Fire reveals the heart of metal, just as hardship reveals the heart of man,\\" Alaric would often say, sweat pearling on his brow as he pounded iron into submission. Then there was Sister Elspeth, the nun who smelled always faintly of lilac and lye, her smile a secret kept close. She tended to the bruised souls of the village, yet behind her kind eyes, a tumultuous past whispered of lost love and a never-borne child. Conversation among the villagers gradually became a lifeline—a web of human connection that brought them closer to understanding the riddles of existence. In the tavern, where the ale flowed and the ambiance was warmed by low-hanging lamps, discussions about Vespero's quest turned from suspicious whispers to boisterous debate. \\"Mark my words, that stranger brings as much trouble as he does hope,\\" grumbled Tom, the barrel-chested tavern keeper, as he slammed a foamy stein on the worn wooden counter. \\"Nonsense,\\" rebuked Maeve, the weaver, her fingers always twitching as if spinning invisible threads. \\"Change is the only constant, and perhaps this Vespero is the change Marigold's been awaiting.\\" It was within these heated exchanges that ideas were born and alliances formed. Yet while the villagers' perspectives clashed and converged, the undercurrent of tension hinted at the unraveling of secrets long buried in the fabric of the village's history. Interspersed within these gatherings, the children of the village enacted their own dramas, building worlds of their own making. They revered Marigold, who, despite her age, was kin in size. With her, they explored and discovered — hunted for dragons in the woods and sought magic in the iridescent sheen of fish scales. One such child, Elias, with hair the color of harvest wheat and eyes that perceived a spectrum of wonder, ventured to ask questions no adult dared. \\"Marigold, can you see the sprites in the stream? Do they whisper secrets to you? Is that why you don’t grow?\\" he inquired, his innocence a sharp blade cutting through layers of fear and superstition. Marigold chuckled, a sound as light as the scattered leaves in the autumn wind. \\"Elias, if only the whispers were so easily deciphered. But perhaps Vespero, with his knowledge from beyond the hills, might reveal more.\\" As one day flowed into the next, the tapestry of the village became ever more intricate, every thread looping and intertwining with the next, a testament to the complexity of its pattern. With the coming of Vespero, the village stood on the brink of change — a pivotal moment that would require every character, however significant or small their role had seemed, to face the impending twist of fate’s loom."},{"prompt":"ku-ku","completion":"Marigold stood by the stone well that had been worn smooth by countless hands drawing sustenance from its depths. She glanced into its shadowy abyss, finding her reflection a wavering specter atop the water. Elias had asked if she heard whispers, and she smiled ruefully at the thought; if the well could speak, what secrets would it divulge? \\"Marigold! Come away from there,\\" called Agatha, her voice tinged with an irrational fear of wells and the deep places of the earth. Despite the whimsy of her thoughts, Marigold obeyed, for in her family, obedience was less a chore than it was a shared, unspoken language of love. As Vespero shared his knowledge and tales of distant realms, it wasn’t only Marigold he influenced. His arrival acted as a catalyst, awakening the dormant desires and fears within the villagers. Alaric, with visions of fire-dancing sprites and enchanted smithing techniques, began to wonder if Vespero’s knowledge could aid him to master the enigmatic alloy that had eluded him — an unyielding metal he called star iron. In hushed tones by the cooling waters of the trough, he confided in Vespero his dreams. \\"Stories say star iron fell from the heavens, infused with the essence of the night sky,\\" Alaric murmured, his eyes reflecting the sparks of his forge. \\"Imagine the possibilities if one could harness such power.\\" Vespero listened intently, his indigo eyes betraying nothing, yet his mind whirring with ancient secrets. \\"The fire of the forge is a fierce spirit, Alaric. If you seek to bind star iron, perhaps what you need is not just skill, but a confluence of the right elements... both tangible and... not.\\" Sister Elspeth, too, found a confidant in Vespero, her heart moved by his quest to upend the forces that shape destiny. In moments of quietude in the chapel, as candlelight cast trembling shadows upon the stone walls, she spoke of her own yearning for transformation, for an undoing of the past. \\"The ache of what could have been is a ghost that haunts the soul with might-have-beens,\\" Sister Elspeth confided, before bestowing blessings upon Vespero, seeking solace in the act of bestowing grace. In the tavern, Tom started noting increasing gatherings under his roof. His cynicism about the newcomer battled with gratitude for the coins that flowed more freely. He caught Maeve's gaze one evening, nodding slightly in recognition of her earlier words. \\"Perhaps some change might indeed fill empty bellies,\\" he conceded, cleaning a mug with more care than usual. Maeve, whose life was a testament to the intertwining of threads in both the literal and metaphoric sense, saw patterns everywhere. \\"No fabric is singular in its design,\\" she told the other villagers. \\"We are woven together, Vespero’s arrival, Marigold’s plight — they are part of a larger weave we are yet to see.\\" It was amidst these subtle shifts in the village that the first signs of Marigold’s change became visible. Not in size or stature, but in her eyes — they began to hold a depth that spoke of worlds unfolding within her, a reflection of the vast, starry night sketched into her irises. Elias, not yet bridled by the weight of adult reservation, observed the transformation with wonder. \\"Your eyes, they look like the night sky just before the dawn,\\" he remarked, naught but admiration in his voice. Marigold smiled at Elias, her heart buoyant with the simplicity of his acceptance. \\"They are filled with stories, Elias, stories that are growing just like the sprouts in the spring field,\\" she whispered. Indeed, the village was a field of sprouting stories, some reaching for the sun, and others entangling, searching for the light of understanding beneath a canopy of leaves. Each character was now caught in the dance of change, reluctant or willing, as the story of \\"Little Nothing\\" unfurled its wings under Vespero's enigmatic guidance, hinting that they all might hold pieces of an arcane puzzle in their everyday struggles and dreams. As the sun dipped below the verdant hills and twilight summoned the first stars, a quiet realization stole upon the village — that every act of curiosity, every poured ale, every woven thread, and every whispered prayer was a delicate stitch in the fabric of a story far larger and more intricate than they could have ever imagined."},{"prompt":"I'm not gonna read all this through 128k tokens in terms, but cool story, bro.","completion":"Thank you!

Adobe Photoshop and Bridge offer a scripting interface that supports JavaScript, AppleScript, and VBScript to automate tasks and create custom solutions. Here are some unique and creative ideas for scripts that could be developed for Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Bridge: **Adobe Photoshop Scripting Ideas:** 1. **Smart Object Layer Compositor:** A script that automates the process of creating multiple compositions from a series of smart objects, each with varied settings or positions, saving out each composition as a separate image file. 2. **Automatic Color Palette Generator:** Create a script that samples prominent colors from an image and generates a color palette layer that users can adjust or export for other design purposes. 3. **Photo Series Stitcher:** A script that stitches together a series of photos (e.g., panoramic shots, timelapse frames) with automatic alignment and exposure blending options. 4. **Dynamic Watermark Application:** Enable users to batch process images with a watermark that dynamically adjusts its size, position, and opacity based on each image's content and dimensions. 5. **Artistic Style Transfer:** Integrate with machine learning models to allow users to apply the stylistic elements of one image (such as a painting) to another, creating a new, stylized version of the image. **Adobe Bridge Scripting Ideas:** 1. **Advanced Batch Rename Tool:** Create a Bridge script that provides more advanced batch renaming features, such as conditional renaming, use of metadata, and sequential numbering with more complex patterns. 2. **Metadata Templating System:** A script that lets users apply predefined or custom metadata templates to selected files in Bridge, thereby streamlining the process of tagging and categorizing assets. 3. **Automatic Portfolio PDF Creator:** Generate professional-looking PDFs from selected images in Bridge, with options for layout customization, image captions (pulled from metadata), and watermark integration. 4. **AI-Driven Tagging Assistant:** Use AI to analyze image content and automatically suggest keywords and tags, which can be reviewed and applied to images to improve searchability within Bridge. 5. **Cross-Application Asset Tracker:** Integrate Bridge with other applications (like InDesign, Illustrator) to keep track of where specific assets are being used and update all instances if the source file is modified. When developing scripts, always consider the target users and their workflows to ensure that your scripts add value and efficiency effectively. Additionally, be mindful of Adobe's scripting guidelines and regulations to ensure compatibility and proper functionality."},{"prompt":"I am very interested in AI-Driven Tagging Assistant idea. Can you please generate a step by step guideline for windows and Bridge 2023? But local or online solution is acceptable but choose one which is a easier to apply.","completion":"Creating an AI-driven tagging assistant for Adobe Bridge would typically involve utilizing an AI service that can analyze image content and generate keywords. For the sake of simplicity and accessibility, let’s consider using an online AI service. Here's a step-by-step guideline to create a simple online AI-driven tagging assistant for Adobe Bridge 2023 on Windows: **Step 1: Choose an AI Image Analysis Service** - Research and select an online image analysis service that offers an API for AI-driven tagging, such as Clarifai, Imagga, or Google Cloud Vision. **Step 2: Register for the Service and Obtain API Keys** - Sign up for an account with the chosen service provider. - Navigate to their API documentation and obtain the necessary API keys for authentication. **Step 3: Install Adobe Bridge SDK for 2023** - Download the Adobe Bridge SDK for the correct version from the Adobe I/O Console. - Follow the installation instructions to set it up on your Windows machine. **Step 4: Set Up Your Scripting Environment** - Ensure you have a code editor (like Visual Studio Code) and a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js) installed on your machine. - Set up a new project folder where you’ll store your script files. **Step 5: Write the AI-Driven Tagging Script** - In your code editor, start a new JavaScript file named \`aiTaggingAssistant.jsx\` for the script. - Within the script, use Adobe Bridge's scripting API to access selected files. - Write the code to send image data to the AI service's API endpoint. - Parse the response from the API to extract tags. - Update the metadata of the image files in Bridge with the received tags. Here's a high-level pseudocode example of what your script might look like: \`\`\`javascript // A skeleton of what your Adobe Bridge script might look like // Include the necessary libraries for HTTP requests, file handling, etc. function aiDrivenTaggingAssistant(selectedFiles) { selectedFiles.forEach(file => { const tags = getTagsFromAI(file); if (tags) { applyTagsToFile(file, tags); } }); } function getTagsFromAI(file) { // Send the file to the AI service's API endpoint. // Handle the API's response and extract tags. // Returns an array of tags. } function applyTagsToFile(file, tags) { // Use Bridge's API to update the file's keywords with the returned tags. } // Main functionality const selectedFiles = getSelectedFilesInBridge(); // You'll need to write this Bridge-specific function. aiDrivenTaggingAssistant(selectedFiles); \`\`\` **Step 6: Test Your Script** - Within Adobe Bridge, run your script to see if it behaves as expected. - Make refinements to handle errors, improve performance, and ensure accurate tag application. **Step 7: Create a User Interface (Optional)** - If you want to make your script more user-friendly, consider creating a UI with dialog boxes. - Use Adobe Bridge's ExtendScript Toolkit to design and implement the UI elements. **Step 8: Packaging and Distribution** - After thoroughly testing your script, package it as a .jsx file. - Write a README document that explains how to install and use the script with Adobe Bridge. **Step 9: Obtain Contributor Feedback** - Share your script with selected users for beta testing. - Use their feedback to make any final adjustments or improvements. Keep in mind that due to the complexity involved in interface and project-specific requirements, the above steps are more like a blueprint than a direct implementation guide. They can vary considerably based on the AI service chosen, its API specifics, and the desired functionality of the script. Also be aware that interacting with online services for AI analysis could incur costs and may require adherence to data privacy standards, so factor these considerations into your project plan."},{"prompt":"So could you also provide local and free solution as well?","completion":"Creating a local and free AI-driven tagging assistant involves using open-source machine learning libraries that can be run on your local system without the need to connect to an online API. The Python ecosystem offers robust libraries for image recognition, such as TensorFlow with a pre-trained model like InceptionV3 for image classification. Since Adobe Bridge does not natively run Python scripts, the workflow would require a combination of JavaScript for the Bridge side of operations and Python for image analysis. Here's an outline for a local AI-driven tagging assistant using Python and Adobe Bridge scripting: **Step 1: Install Python and Required Libraries** - If you do not have Python installed, get it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). - Install necessary libraries with \`pip\`, such as TensorFlow and possibly others like \`numpy\` and \`pillow\`. **Step 2: Set Up a Pre-trained Image Recognition Model** - Download a pre-trained TensorFlow model that is capable of image classification, for example, InceptionV3. - Familiarize yourself with how to use the model to classify images and get tags (may require some understanding of TensorFlow and machine learning). **Step 3: Write a Python Script for Image Classification** - Create a Python script that processes images and returns a set of tags for each image. - This script should be executable from the command line and will be called from the JavaScript executed by Bridge. **Step 4: Set Up Your Adobe Bridge Scripting Environment** - Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., \`localAiTaggingAssistant.jsx\`) that Adobe Bridge will execute. - The script should interact with selected files in Bridge and call the Python script using the system's shell. **Step 5: Develop the Bridge Integration Script** - Use Adobe Bridge's JavaScript scripting API to get the paths of selected image files. - Write code to call the Python script for each image and capture the output (the tags). - Update the metadata of the image files in Bridge with the returned tags. **Step 6: Test the Entire Workflow** - Select images within Adobe Bridge and run your JavaScript. - Check if the images are processed by the Python script and that the resulting tags are correctly applied to the images' metadata within Bridge. **Step 7: Create Error Handling and Logs** - Implement error handling within both the Bridge script and Python script to handle cases such as failed image processing or issues updating metadata. - Create logs for actions and errors for easy troubleshooting. **Step 8: Documentation and Usage Instructions** - Write clear documentation on how to set up and use the scripts, including how to install Python and the required libraries. **Step 9: Distribution and Feedback** - Share your tool with colleagues or the community and gather feedback to improve functionality and usability. Example Command in \`.jsx\` script to call a Python script might look like: \`\`\`javascript var pythonScriptPath = \\"C:pathtoyourpythonscript.py\\"; var imagePath = \\"C:pathtothecurrentimage.jpg\\"; var command = \\"python \\"\\" + pythonScriptPath + \\"\\" \\"\\" + imagePath + \\"\\"\\"; var tags = app.system(command); // Execute the command and capture the output \`\`\` Your Python script will need to be configured to handle command-line arguments (using \`sys.argv\`), process the image, perform the classification, and print the result back to stdout, which is captured by the \`.jsx\` script. This approach requires users to have Python installed and the appropriate scripts configured correctly, which makes it a bit more complex than an all-JavaScript solution within Adobe Bridge. However, it has the benefit of being entirely local and free, assuming you use open-source libraries and models."},{"prompt":"Do you have an ability to learn specific subjects in depth such as Photoshop scripting for example?","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm designed to have a broad knowledge base and help with a wide range of topics.

Her heart held an insatiable wanderlust, and she dreamt of the day she would embark on a grand journey to see the world beyond her small corner of it. As seasons turned and years slipped by, Lyra prepared, saving each coin, studying maps, and learning from the tales of travelers passing through. The morning that marked the beginning of her adventure finally arrived—a bright, brisk spring day. With a leather satchel slung over her shoulder and a sturdy walking stick in hand, Lyra took one last look at the cobblestone path of her childhood and set out toward the unknown. Lyra traversed through emerald forests, over serene brooks, and into bustling towns with strange customs and curious scents. She climbed steep mountains where the air was thin and pure and crossed arid lands where the sun was relentless but the night sky, a canvas of a thousand diamonds. With each step, her confidence grew, and with each encounter, her journal filled with tales of kindness, courage, and wonder. Her journey took her east, toward the great Crescent Bay famed for its breathtaking sunrises and the indigo depths of its waters. People spoke of a small, secluded island at the heart of the bay, where no footsteps marred its sands, and it was untouched by time. Captivated, Lyra's determined eyes set upon this mysterious isle as the zenith of her expedition. Nearing the coastline, she secured passage on a humble fishing boat whose captain, grizzled by years at sea, agreed to take her across the treacherous waters. The promise of the solitary island beaconed, and her heart surged with joy as the salty breeze whispered of new horizons. Days into the voyage, the skies betrayed their serene appearance as the sun's face was shrouded by a cloak of swirling black clouds. The waves, now colossal, clashed against the boat with a fury that shook the bones of man and vessel alike. Lyra clung desperately to the railing, her eyes wide with alarm as the captain and his crew fought to navigate the storm. The very elements seemed to rage against them, a primordial force awakened and angry. Without warning, a towering wall of water rose like a titan from the depths, a rogue wave born of the tempest's heart. It struck the boat with a devastating blow, splintering wood and tearing sails, casting both men and precious supplies into the dark belly of the sea. Lyra felt the world spin and lurch before water filled her vision, cold and unyielding. When she awoke, it was on a beach, the storm receded, leaving an eerie calm hanging in the air. The island, by some stroke of fortune or fate, had caught her in its embrace, though the price of sanctuary was steep. Alone, with nothing but the salt-stained clothes on her back and the stars to keep her company, she looked upon the beach—her destination now a prison. Days turned into weeks as Lyra struggled for survival, foraging for food, constructing a rudimentary shelter, and signaling for rescue. Fires burned into the night, smoky beacons reaching out to the world she had been severed from. In time, her prayers were answered, an explorer's ship drawn by the unusual sign of life on the island and the peculiar smoke whispering above its trees. The crew found her a changed woman, her eyes reflecting both the ordeal she endured and the awe for the strength she never knew she had. Lyra's journey, intended to be an enterprise of discovery, had turned into a profound testament to her resilience. Though the disaster had interrupted her dream, it ultimately bore witness to the spirit's capacity to prevail, to adapt and to grow in the face of adversity. Battling against the forces of nature, she found a deeper journey—a voyage within, a discovery not of places, but of her own untapped tenacity and courage. And as the ship carried her home, beyond the whispering horizon, Lyra knew her true journey was far from over. This was but a chapter in an unending tale of adventure, for the heart that has known the fury of the storm learns to sail the winds of fate with newfound bravery."},{"prompt":"(A∈B, C, D)(B∈A, C, D)(C∈B, A, D)(D∈B, C, A)(A∈A1)(B∈B1)(C∈C1)(D∈D1):(A=C)(B=Si)(C=Ge)(D=Sn)(A1=FeOSFCl)(B1=BiSNOBr)(C1=AuClFIN)(D1=UNPFS)","completion":"We are given the following statements: 1) A ∈ B, C, D 2) B ∈ A, C, D 3) C ∈ B, A, D 4) D ∈ B, C, A 5) A ∈ A1 6) B ∈ B1 7) C ∈ C1 8) D ∈ D1 From statement 1, we know that A is an element of B, C, and D.

Her vampiric existence has been one filled with adventure, manipulation, and survival. Aesthetically, Sarika is a stunning woman with long, dark hair, olive skin, and piercing green eyes. She possesses an undeniable charm and an air of mystery that draws people in. However, beneath her alluring façade lies a cunning and survival-oriented mind. Born into a wealthy merchant family in Mumbai, India, in 1785, Sarika's mortal life was relatively sheltered. She had everything a young woman of her status could desire - her family's wealth, a suitable arranged marriage, and the promise of a comfortable life. However, Sarika thirsted for more than societal expectations and obligations. The creative, rebellious spirit within her craved adventure and freedom. Sarika's path crossed with that of a charismatic Ravnos named Anwar during her teenage years. Anwar recognized the hunger for change within Sarika and saw her potential. He offered her a new life, a life of eternal existence as a vampire. Fascinated by the idea of leaving her mundane existence behind, Sarika took the leap and embraced the embrace. For decades, Sarika traveled alongside Anwar, honing her skills in manipulation, illusion, and thievery. The world was their playground, and they reveled in their capacity to manipulate both mortals and other Kindred. They were a formidable duo, exploiting the weaknesses of the powerful and savoring the bittersweet taste of victory. However, their carefree existence came to a halt during the Week of Nightmares. The disastrous events shook the very foundations of the world of darkness, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake. Many Kindred met their final demise, and Sarika and Anwar found themselves separated amidst the turmoil. It was during this time that Sarika experienced true fear and desperation, as she struggled to survive the dangerous nights. Laying low and hiding in Gainesville, Florida, Sarika pondered her next move. The events of the Week of Nightmares had left her shaken, and she realized it was time to reassess her priorities. No longer did she only seek material wealth and power; survival and stability were now at the top of her list. Unable to rely on her usual manipulations, Sarika resorted to her wit and charm to secure a place among the local Kindred. She cautiously observed the vampire society in Gainesville, learning about the power dynamics and the various factions vying for control. Sarika knew she had to be meticulous in her actions, making alliances and connections cautiously. In this new chapter of her existence, Sarika adopted a new approach. She became an influential financial advisor, using her financial acumen to amass a respectable fortune while simultaneously manipulating the mortal financial institutions. Her charm and persuasiveness allowed her to sway the decisions of influential individuals, ensuring her survival and position within the Kindred society of Gainesville. Underneath her calm exterior, Sarika remains haunted by the nightmares of the past. She knows she can never fully escape the clutches of her Ravnos nature, but she is determined to at least attempt to control it. Sarika strives to find meaning and purpose amidst the chaos, hoping to rise above the savagery of her clan's reputation and prove herself as a valuable and reliable ally. As the nights pass in Gainesville, Sarika Ravindran weaves intricate webs of manipulation, seeking to secure her survival while navigating the treacherous waters of the Kindred society."},{"prompt":"Create a 500 word backstory about a Vampire the Masquerade 5th edition Ravnos named Derek Griffon, whose Archetype is Master of Illusions, Predator Type is Hitcher, was Embraced in 4/14/1990, and who is a survivor of the Week of Nightmares and now lives in Gainesville, FL.","completion":"Name: Derek Griffon Age: 31 (Appearance), 30 years undead Clan: Ravnos City: Gainesville, FL Backstory: Derek Griffon, a mischievous and cunning Ravnos, had always possessed a knack for trickery and illusion. His mortal life, however, left much to be desired. Born in a small, rundown neighborhood in Gainesville, Florida, Derek grew up with constant financial struggles and an absent father figure. To cope with his difficult upbringing, he honed his skills in the art of deception and misdirection, using these talents to survive the harsh realities of his surroundings. In the spring of 1990, the fateful night that would forever change Derek's life arrived. While exploring an abandoned carnival on the outskirts of town, he stumbled upon a group of mysterious individuals engaging in a dangerous game of chance. Drawn to the enigmatic Ravnos and their mesmerizing illusions, Derek found himself inexplicably drawn into their world. One of the Ravnos, a charismatic and deceptive Trickster named Lucius, took a keen interest in Derek's natural abilities and recognized his potential as a Kindred. Fascinated by the possibilities of embracing such a talented trickster, Lucius offered Derek a choice – to continue his mundane existence in a world of poverty and despair or to embrace the immortal life of a vampire. Eager for a fresh start and enchanted by the allure of the supernatural, Derek willingly accepted Lucius' Embrace. However, Derek's newfound existence as a vampire was far from idyllic. Shortly after his Embrace, he found himself thrust into the midst of the tumultuous Week of Nightmares. The cataclysmic events shook the vampire society to its core, and Derek fought tooth and nail to survive the chaos. The illusions he had once used to deceive his mortal adversaries became an invaluable tool for survival, allowing him to blend with the shadows and escape the wrath of both enemy Kindred and supernatural forces. Emerging from the ashes of the Week of Nightmares, Derek found solace in his hometown of Gainesville. Here, he could nurture his skills and temper his appetite for illusions away from the prying eyes of powerful enemies. He settled himself in the outskirts of town, embracing the darkness and the unpredictable nature of the adventures that awaited him. As the years passed, Derek embraced his role as a master of illusions and became an expert in misdirection and manipulation. He reveled in his ability to twist the perceptions of both mortals and Kindred alike, using his skills to survive while savoring the chaos and confusion he created. His playful nature emerged as he hitched rides with unsuspecting victims, hitchhiking across the state of Florida and leaving them bewildered and doubting their own senses. Living in Gainesville, Derek continues to navigate the treacherous world of the Kindred. He draws little interest to the fact that others view his clan with suspicion and disdain, finding comfort in the shadows and in the darkest corners of the city. Intrigued by the endless possibilities that his illusionary powers provide, Derek finds himself entangled in a world he never dreamed possible. As the nights pass in Gainesville, Derek Griffon combines his natural talent, his powers of illusion, and his Ravnos lineage to traverse the complex web of vampire politics while satisfying his insatiable hunger for adventure. With a charm befitting of a true trickster, he weaves illusions and manipulations effortlessly, always one step ahead of those who seek to unravel his secrets."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

From a young age, his silver-tongued persuasion and love for the dramatic drew people into his orbit. Born and raised in the vibrant city of New Orleans, his upbringing was a mix of colorful stories and eclectic inspirations that fueled his artistic pursuits. Even as a mortal, Derek found himself drawn to the occult, indulging in tarot readings and exploring the realms of magic. It was during a chance encounter at a masquerade ball that Derek's life took an unexpected turn. Little did he know that the elegant woman he danced with, Cassandra, was a member of the Ravnos clan, one of the eldest vampire bloodlines, known for their mastery of illusions and trickery. Captivated by Derek's natural charm and flair for the dramatic, Cassandra recognized a kindred spirit, and chose him as her Childe. On April 14, 1990, Derek Griffon was Embraced into the world of darkness, becoming a Ravnos of the Fifth Generation. As an Archetype of Master of Illusions, he quickly delved into the secrets of his clan, honing his skills in deception and manipulation. Derek relished in the newfound power his vampiric blood bestowed upon him, finding a deep satisfaction in weaving intricate illusions that confounded his enemies and bewitched his victims. But fate had much more in store for Derek than he could have anticipated. In the late 1990s, the world was thrown into chaos during the harrowing Week of Nightmares. The ancient Antediluvians, thought to be myths, rose from their slumber, causing destruction and havoc across the Kindred society. Derek, still a fledgling in his own right, found himself caught in the crossfire of this catastrophic event. The supernatural storms and fires ravaged the city of New Orleans, leaving behind broken structures and shattered illusions. Miraculously, Derek managed to survive the cataclysmic events, though the experience forever changed him. The once carefree artist now carried the weight of tragedy and loss upon his shoulders. Determined to rebuild his life, Derek sought solace in a place far from the blood-soaked memories of his former home. He relocated to Gainesville, Florida, where he hoped to find a fresh start amidst the swamps and unpredictable magic of the region. In Gainesville, Derek treaded carefully, utilizing his mastery of illusions to blend in with the mortal world. He adopted the role of a charismatic performer, using his talents as a magician to bewitch his audiences and gather a loyal following. Through his performances, he discovered a hidden underbelly of supernatural creatures that inhabited the city, and soon immersing himself in the clandestine world of the supernatural community. As a predator, Derek embraced his Hitcher nature, preying upon the unsuspecting wanderers and hitchhikers who ventured into the nearby woods. There, amidst the darkness, Derek would lure his victims with promises of thrilling adventures, and then revel in their fear as he ensnared them within his illusions. To him, it was an intricate dance, a delicate balance between predator and prey. Yet, in the depths of his soul, Derek yearned for something more profound. The weight of his previous losses drove him to seek redemption, a chance to find purpose amidst his often morally ambiguous existence. He set out to protect those who were caged within their own illusions, offering them a glimpse of truth and freedom from their self-imposed constraints. Derek Griffon now wanders the streets of Gainesville, forever adorned in his flamboyant clothing and hidden behind a veil of mystery. A survivor of the Week of Nightmares, he has emerged from the ashes, a symbol of resilience and transformation. Through his mastery of illusions, he strives to bring light to a world cloaked in darkness, all while concealing his own secrets and struggles that lie hidden beneath the surface."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Technology had advanced beyond imagination, with flying cars buzzing through the skies, holographic displays seamlessly integrated into everyday life, and robots performing tasks once reserved for humans. But for all the wonders of this new age, there was a darker side to this future. Time travel had become a reality. It was a power that only a select few possessed, but it had the potential to reshape history, with devastating consequences. To prevent this misuse, a new force emerged – the Timecops. They were a highly trained group of individuals tasked with policing the timelines, ensuring that history unfolded as it should. One such Timecop was Sarah Thompson. She was recruited into the agency at a young age, possessing a keen intellect and an unyielding determination. Sarah had always been fascinated by the concept of time – the idea that a single moment could hold infinite possibilities. So, when given the opportunity to become a Timecop, she eagerly seized it. Sarah's first assignment involved investigating a series of temporal disturbances in the early 21st century. It was an era marked by global unrest, political turmoil, and environmental crisis. As Sarah traveled back in time, she couldn't help but feel a sense of trepidation. She knew that any alteration to this critical period could have dire consequences for the future. As Sarah arrived in the past, she found herself in a bustling city. The air was heavy with smog, and people hurried about with worried expressions. She attempted to blend into the crowd, concealing her futuristic attire beneath a trench coat. It didn't take long for her to stumble upon the source of the temporal disturbances – a rogue time traveler wreaking havoc. The culprit was a man named Michael Kane, a disgruntled scientist obsessed with rewriting history. His actions threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of the world. Sarah knew that she had to stop him at all costs. She devoted her every waking moment to tracking him down, meticulously piecing together clues left behind in the timeline. The pursuit took Sarah across the globe, from the slums of New York City to the ancient ruins of Rome. She skillfully navigated through the twists and turns of history, sometimes encountering the great figures of the past. But no encounter was more harrowing than when she found herself face-to-face with Michael Kane. They met in an abandoned laboratory, filled with the buzzing of machinery from another era. Michael greeted Sarah with a malevolent grin, taunting her about her inability to change the course of history. But Sarah remained steadfast, unwavering in her duty as a Timecop. The ensuing battle was a whirlwind of time-bending technology and heart-stopping moments. Sarah dodged blasts of energy, while desperately trying to subdue the rogue scientist. It was a dangerous game of cat and mouse, with the very fabric of time hanging in the balance. Finally, after a fierce struggle, Sarah managed to overpower Michael and disable his time-travel device. As she bound him in temporal restraints, she couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She had fulfilled her duty, ensuring that history would unfold as it should. Returning to her present, Sarah reflected on her journey as a Timecop. Their mission was vital, protecting the integrity of time itself. It was a responsibility that required sacrifices and unwavering resolve, and she was proud to be a part of it. But the fight was far from over. Time, like a river, constantly flowed, presenting new challenges along the way. As Sarah glanced at her futuristic gadgets, she knew that she was ready to face whatever dangers lay ahead. With a renewed sense of purpose, she vowed to continue the fight, for the sake of preserving a world worth living in – a world shaped by the unyielding effort of the Timecops."},{"prompt":"Translate this text into Ukrainian.

Транспортное средство или воздушное судно, находящееся в пределах критической зоны, может вызывать отражение и/или дифракцию сигналов средства, что может привести к значительным искажениям сигналов наведения на траектории захода на посадку. Дифракция и/или отражение могут также возникать в тех случаях, когда вблизи ВПП находятся одно или несколько больших воздушных судов или транспортных средств, что может привести к искажению сигналов глиссадного и курсового радиомаяка. Эта дополнительная зона, расположенная вне критической зоны, называется чувствительной зоной. Размеры чувствительных зон изменяются в зависимости от характеристик средства и категории полетов. Чтобы установить границы чувствительных зон, необходимо определить уровень помех, создаваемых воздушными судами и транспортными средствами в различных местах на аэродроме.

Exfoliable?","completion":"Silicon titanate typically refers to compounds composed primarily of silicon, titanium, and oxygen, often represented by the formula SiTiOₓ, where x depends on the specific stoichiometry of the compound. These materials can form several different crystal structures and are used in various applications ranging from pigments to ceramics and electronic components. Exfoliation is a process used to create thin layers or sheets from a bulk material. It is typically associated with materials that exhibit layered structures, such as graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2), which have relatively weak van der Waals forces holding the layers together. These forces can be overcome to separate the layers and produce individual sheets that can be as thin as a single atom or molecule in thickness. Silicon titanate does not generally exhibit a layered structure with weak bonding between layers like graphite does. Instead, its crystal structure tends to be more 3D network-like, with stronger bonding throughout the material. This means it inherently lacks the planes of weakness that characterize highly exfoliable materials. Therefore, silicon titanate is not typically considered an easily exfoliable material in the same way as graphite and other 2D materials are. However, scientists and engineers can use a variety of techniques to create thin films or nanostructures of non-layered materials, including silicon titanate. Methods such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or specific etching processes might be used to produce thin films or nanostructures for specialized applications. It's important to note that developments in materials science are rapid and that novel methods for manipulating materials at the nanoscale might emerge, potentially enabling the exfoliation or formation of thin layers from a wider variety of materials than is currently possible."},{"prompt":"What exfoliable titanates are there maybe it was Sn titanate","completion":"The exfoliation process is typically associated with van der Waals solids, such as graphite or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which consist of layers held together by weak van der Waals forces, allowing for easy separation into thin sheets or flakes. When it comes to titanates, certain types may form layered structures amenable to exfoliation, although they may not be as prevalent or well-known as other exfoliable materials like graphene. Layered titanates, such as some alkali metal titanates (e.g., potassium or sodium titanates), might exhibit a structure that can be exfoliated under the right conditions to produce nanosheets. In the case of stannous titanate (SnTiO₃) or stannic titanate (SnO₂·TiO₂), typically used in similar contexts as silicon titanate, they may not have a naturally exfoliable structure similar to materials like graphite. These compounds tend to have more complex crystal structures with strong ionic and/or covalent bonds throughout, rather than having distinct layers weakly bonded to each other. However, there has been research on layered titanates that includes hydrogen titanates and lepidocrocite-type titanates that can be exfoliated into nanosheets. For example, some researchers have managed to synthesize sodium titanate nanosheets through exfoliation processes. These materials can be produced by alkaline hydrothermal treatment of TiO₂, followed by proton exchange and exfoliation in water. Moreover, some complex titanate perovskites may also exist in a layered form and could potentially be exfoliated under specific conditions. It's important to note that the ability to exfoliate a particular titanate would depend on its unique crystal structure and bonding characteristics. In materials science, advances are constantly being made, and it's possible that methods for synthesizing and exfoliating new types of layered titanates will continue to develop. For specific titanate compounds, like the one you might be referring to, one would need to look at the current state of research to determine their potential for exfoliation."},{"prompt":"Ok more exfoliable semiconductors please .I need them all","completion":"Exfoliable semiconductors are primarily two-dimensional (2D) materials that can be mechanically or chemically thinned down to monolayers or few-layer structures. This category of materials is of great interest in the field of electronics and optoelectronics due to their unique physical properties that arise when confined to such thin layers. Here is a list of several known exfoliable semiconductor materials: 1. **Graphene**: While not a semiconductor itself (it's a semi-metal with zero bandgap), graphene can be modified to create a bandgap, making it functionally similar to a semiconductor. 2. **Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs)**: This group includes materials such as: - MoS2 (Molybdenum disulfide) - WS2 (Tungsten disulfide) - MoSe2 (Molybdenum diselenide) - WSe2 (Tungsten diselenide) 3. **Black Phosphorus (Phosphorene)**: Exhibits a layer-dependent direct bandgap, making it useful for applications in electronics and photodetectors. 4. **Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN)**: Often referred to as \\"white graphene,\\" h-BN is an insulator but is often used in conjunction with other 2D semiconductors due to its exceptional electrical and thermal properties. 5. **MXenes**: A large family of 2D metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides with general formula Mn+1Xn, where M represents a transition metal, and X is carbon and/or nitrogen. 6. **Silicene**: A single layer of silicon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, similar to graphene. 7. **Germanene**: A single layer of germanium atoms, also with a hexagonal structure. 8. **Stanene** (also known as tinene): A single layer of tin atoms with promising properties for topological insulators. 9. **Bismuthene**: A single layer of bismuth atoms, which has been studied for its potential as a topological insulator. 10. **Indium Selenide (InSe)**: A layered material that has gained interest due to its high electron mobility and tunable bandgap. 11. **Gallium Selenide (GaSe)**: Similar to InSe, it is a layered compound semiconductor with potential applications in electronics and photovoltaics. 12. **Perovskites**: Certain layered organic-inorganic halide perovskites can be exfoliated and have semiconducting properties valuable for optoelectronics. This list is not exhaustive, and the field of 2D materials is continuously expanding as researchers discover and synthesize new materials with potentially useful electronic properties. The ability to exfoliate these materials into thin layers opens up possibilities for creating new kinds of nanoscale devices and exploring the fundamental physics of materials in the 2D limit. Additionally, synthesis techniques and material engineering (such as strain engineering, alloying, or surface functionalization) keep evolving, enhancing the semiconducting properties of these materials for various applications. Please note that exfoliation methods can be complex and may not always result in high-quality monolayers, so material scientists also employ other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for the production of high-quality, large-area films of these semiconducting materials."},{"prompt":"Ok now list all known exfoliable photocatalysts","completion":"Exfoliable photocatalysts are a subset of materials that can be thinned down to nanosheets or few-layer structures and possess the ability to absorb light and drive chemical reactions. These exfoliated nanostructures can offer high surface area, unique electronic properties, and enhanced light-matter interactions, making them especially attractive for applications in solar energy harvesting, environmental remediation, and the synthesis of chemicals. Here is a list of several known exfoliable photocatalysts: 1. **Titanium Dioxide (TiO2)**: Often found in the form of anatase, which is a highly active photocatalyst under UV light. 2. **Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4)**: Known for its visible-light photocatalytic activity, used for water splitting and degradation of pollutants. 3. **Cadmium Sulfide (CdS)**: Exhibits strong photocatalytic activity under visible light, often used in hydrogen production from water splitting. 4. **Zinc Oxide (ZnO)**: Like TiO2, it's more active under UV light but can be modified to extend its activity into the visible spectrum. 5. **Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4)**: A polymeric, metal-free photocatalyst that can absorb light in the visible range. 6. **Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2)**: Better known for its electronic properties, but the edges of MoS2 nanosheets have been shown to possess photocatalytic activity. 7. **Tungsten Disulfide (WS2)**: Similar to MoS2, WS2 can exhibit photocatalytic properties particularly at edge sites. 8. **Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs)**: These are materials composed of layers with positively charged metal hydroxides and charge-balancing interlayer anions; some LDHs can be photocatalytically active. 9. **Black Phosphorus**: When exfoliated to thin layers, black phosphorus has shown potential for photocatalytic applications due to its direct bandgap. 10. **Perovskites**: Certain layered organic-inorganic halide perovskites can be exfoliated and have shown promise as visible-light-driven photocatalysts. 11. **Transition Metal Oxides and Dichalcogenides**: Beyond the ones mentioned above, other transition metal oxides (like WO3) and dichalcogenides (like MoTe2) can also have photocatalytic capabilities. These materials can be mechanically or chemically exfoliated to produce thin, active photocatalysts. For instance, the top-down approach of liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) can produce dispersed 2D materials in solvents. Alternatively, intercalation methods can expand the layered structure and facilitate the separation of individual layers into nanosheets. It's worth mentioning that the photocatalytic performance of these exfoliated materials often depends on factors such as crystal structure, defect sites, surface area, electronic band structure, and the ability to couple with co-catalysts. Furthermore, sophisticated material engineering techniques, including doping, heterojunction formation, and sensitization, are used to enhance the efficiency and broaden the light absorption range of photocatalysts. Due to the rapid pace of research and development in this field, new exfoliable photocatalytic materials continue to be discovered and their properties investigated, contributing to advances in sustainable energy and environmental remediation technologies."},{"prompt":"перефразируй:Позиция для установки антенной системы курсового радиомаяка ILS категорий II и III размещается на продолжении осевой линии ВПП у ее конца, противоположного ее порогу.

Here's a brief overview and some regulatory considerations: **Cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security and operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology. The most renowned cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are thousands of others, including Ethereum, Ripple (XRP), Litecoin, and more. **Blockchain Technology:** Blockchain is the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. It's a distributed ledger that allows data to be stored on thousands of servers while letting anyone on the network see everyone else's entries in real-time. This makes it difficult for one user to gain control of the network or tamper with the records. **Regulatory Aspects:** 1. **Legal Status and Definitions:** Governments need to define the legal status of cryptocurrencies. Are they considered currency, a commodity, a security, or something else? This definition will guide the application of existing laws and inform the development of new regulations. 2. **Taxation:** Governments must decide how to tax cryptocurrencies. This includes addressing issues like capital gains tax, income tax from mining, and sales tax (VAT) when used in transactions. 3. **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC):** Implementing AML and KYC regulations are vital for preventing the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities. Regulators need to ensure that exchanges and wallet providers verify customer identities and report suspicious activities to the authorities. 4. **Consumer Protection:** Many consumers may not fully understand the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, such as volatility or the potential for loss due to hacking. Regulations may be necessary to ensure consumer protection, including clear information, the security of funds, and a framework for resolving disputes. 5. **Security Standards:** With the rise in cryptocurrency-related cybercrimes, regulators need to enforce stringent security measures for exchanges, wallet providers, and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) projects to protect against fraud, hacks, and scams. 6. **Market Integrity and Fairness:** Market manipulation is a concern in cryptocurrency trading. Regulators can implement rules to promote fair trading practices and to ensure that exchanges are not engaging in manipulative practices themselves. 7. **Interoperability and Technical Standards:** As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, ensuring interoperability between different systems and setting technical standards will be important for scalability and efficiency. 8. **Regulatory Sandbox:** Some governments have established regulatory sandboxes to allow fintech and blockchain firms to test new products and services in a controlled environment with regulatory oversight, which can help inform future regulations. 9. **International Collaboration:** Cryptocurrencies are inherently global, so international collaboration is vital for regulatory effectiveness. This could involve sharing best practices, harmonizing regulatory approaches, and taking coordinated action against global threats. Regulators must maintain a delicate balance between allowing innovation and entrepreneurship to flourish in the blockchain space while protecting consumers and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. These efforts often involve ongoing dialogue with industry participants, technology experts, academia, and other stakeholders to develop an informed and flexible regulatory framework."},{"prompt":"If you want to write a policy paper about Cryptocurrencies, how do you do so?","completion":"Writing a policy paper on cryptocurrencies involves a comprehensive approach to understanding the implications of digital currencies, the technology that underlies them, and the potential impact on various sectors.
