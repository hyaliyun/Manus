Firstly, the chi-square test is used to determine if there's a significant difference between observed frequencies (the numbers that you've collected or observed in your study) and expected frequencies (the numbers that you would expect to see if there was no effect or association). Given: - Observed frequencies (O): 156, 69, 30, 7, 0 for categories 1 through 5 respectively. - To find the standardized residuals, we also need the expected frequencies (E) for each category, which aren't provided in your question. However, standardized residuals are calculated using the formula: [ text{Standardized Residual} = frac{(O - E)}{sqrt{E}} ] For chi-square tests, some sources adjust this calculation to account for continuity correction or to use a pooled estimate of variance, but the provided formula is the most straightforward way for calculating standardized residuals. If a more precise adjustment is needed, the formula might slightly differ. Also, for two-way tables or contingency tables, the formula might be adjusted to: [ text{Standardized Residual} = frac{(O - E)}{sqrt{E(1 - frac{row total}{grand total})(1 - frac{column total}{grand total})}} ] This adjustment accounts for the proportions of the totals by row and by column, but it's more typically seen in Pearson's chi-square tests for contingency tables. The values you've provided: - For N1 (156), a standardized residual of 14.31 suggests that the expected frequency for this category is significantly lower than the observed frequency. However, without the expected frequencies, we cannot calculate it exactly as noted before. - Similarly, for N5 (0), a standardized residual of -7.24 suggests that the expected frequency for this category was significantly higher than the observed (which was 0). Given the above, to calculate these residuals precisely, you would need the expected frequencies for each category. The formula then straightforwardly yields each residual by indicating how many standard deviations the observed frequencies deviate from the expected frequencies. Residuals with higher absolute values (further from 0) indicate larger discrepancies between observed and expected counts. Without knowing the expected frequencies (E) for each category, we can't replicate the specific residuals you've mentioned. Typically, E is derived based on the hypothesis or distribution assumption underlying your analysis (for example, equal distribution across categories, distribution based on a proportion, etc.)."},{"prompt":"Chi Square Goodness of Fit","completion":"When you're working with a Chi-square goodness of fit test, you're interested in comparing your observed data (what you've measured or collected) to what you would expect under a specific hypothesis. The goal is to see if the observed frequencies significantly deviate from the expected frequencies across different categories or outcomes. This helps in determining whether your observed data fits a certain distribution. Given that you are interested in calculating standardized residuals for a Chi-square goodness of fit test, let's expand a bit on how these calculations might look, considering you now know that the focus is on a goodness of fit scenario. # Steps to Calculate Standardized Residuals: 1. **Calculate Expected Frequencies (E):** For a goodness of fit test, the expected frequencies typically depend on your null hypothesis. The null hypothesis generally posits that the data follows a specific distribution or that the proportions of categories are as stated under the hypothesis. You calculate expected frequencies based on this hypothesis. 2. **Observed Frequencies (O):** These are given in your data. In your case: 156, 69, 30, 7, and 0. 3. **Calculate Chi-Square Statistic:** This is more for context, but it's part of the analysis. It's given by: [ chi^2 = sum frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} ] Where (O_i) is the observed frequency for category (i), and (E_i) is the expected frequency for category (i). 4. **Calculate Standardized Residuals:** Each residual for a category is calculated with: [ text{Residual} = frac{(O - E)}{sqrt{E}} ] If considering adjustments for small expected counts, Yates' correction might be applied, or considerations for degrees of freedom might affect interpretation but not the calculation of residuals per se. # Example: Assuming your categories are expected to have equal frequencies (just for the sake of an example), and there are 5 categories with a total of 262 observations (156 + 69 + 30 + 7 + 0 = 262), then each category would be expected to have ( frac{262}{5} = 52.4 ) observations if the observed data perfectly followed the expected distribution. The standardized residual for the first category (just as an example calculation) would be calculated as: [ text{Residual} = frac{(156 - 52.4)}{sqrt{52.4}} ] [ text{Residual} = frac{103.6}{sqrt{52.4}} approx frac{103.6}{7.24} approx 14.31 ] This matches the first residual you provided, so it looks like expected counts might have indeed been equal for all categories, making this a hypothetical calculation for how E was derived. # Note: This example makes a simplifying assumption about the expected frequency being equal across all categories, which might not be the case in your actual scenario. For more precise calculations, it's essential to know how the expected frequencies were determined based on the null hypothesis of your specific Chi-square goodness of fit test. Without knowing exactly how E is set up in your scenario, we've used the assumption to illustrate the process."},{"prompt":"Then X^2(4, 262) =311.4,p =0.0001 how to get it?","completion":"Given your observed and expected frequencies, and assuming equal expected frequencies as in the example I provided earlier, let's clarify how to compute the chi-square ((X^2)) statistic and understand the given result. # Step 1: Calculate Expected Frequencies (E) Let's continue with the assumption that the expected frequencies for each category are equal (which would be true in a scenario where the null hypothesis expects an equal distribution across categories, or another specific distribution leading to a common expected frequency). For a total of 262 observations divided equally among 5 categories, each category's expected frequency would be (E = frac{262}{5} = 52.4). # Step 2: Calculate Chi-Square ((X^2)) Statistic The formula to calculate the Chi-square statistic is: [ X^2 = sum frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} ] where: - (O_i) = Observed frequency for category (i), - (E_i) = Expected frequency for category (i). Let's calculate it with the observed data (156, 69, 30, 7, 0) and with (E = 52.4) for each category: [ X^2 = frac{(156 - 52.4)^2}{52.4} + frac{(69 - 52.4)^2}{52.4} + frac{(30 - 52.4)^2}{52.4} + frac{(7 - 52.4)^2}{52.4} + frac{(0 - 52.4)^2}{52.4} ] [ X^2 = frac{10715.36}{52.4} + frac{274.56}{52.4} + frac{502.56}{52.4} + frac{2059.36}{52.4} + frac{2745.76}{52.4} ] [ X^2 = 204.8 + 5.24 + 9.59 + 39.28 + 52.42 ] [ X^2 = 311.33 ] This result approximates the chi-square value you provided, (X^2 = 311.4). Small discrepancies might arise from rounding errors in the intermediate steps. # Step 3: Degrees of Freedom (DF) and P-value The degrees of freedom for a chi-square goodness of fit test are calculated as the number of categories minus one: (DF = k - 1). In this case, with 5 categories, (DF = 5 - 1 = 4). The chi-square value ((X^2 = 311.33)) and degrees of freedom ((DF = 4)) can be used to find the p-value using chi-square distribution tables or software. The extremely high value of (X^2) compared to the DF suggests a very small p-value, indicating that the observed frequencies significantly differ from the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis. This aligns with the p-value you mentioned, (p = 0.0001), suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis. To find the exact p-value, statistical software or chi-square distribution tables are typically used. A p-value of (0.0001) indicates a probability of less than 0.01% that the observed deviations from the expected frequencies could occur by chance, leading to rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, that there is a significant difference between the observed and expected frequencies."},{"prompt":"formula of p","completion":"The (p)-value is a fundamental concept in hypothesis testing used to measure the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. However, it's important to note that there isn't a simple, universal \\"formula for (p)\\" that applies to all statistical tests. Instead, how you calculate a (p)-value depends on the specific statistical test you're using and the distribution that applies to its test statistic under the null hypothesis. For the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the (p)-value is calculated based on the chi-square test statistic and the chi-square distribution. The chi-square distribution is defined by degrees of freedom, which, for a goodness-of-fit test, is typically calculated as the number of categories minus 1 ((k - 1)), where (k) is the number of unique categories or groups in your data. # Chi-square ((chi^2)) Test and (p)-value Given: - A chi-square test statistic ((chi^2)), - Degrees of freedom ((DF)), The (p)-value can be found using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the chi-square distribution: [ p = 1 - CDF(chi^2|DF) ] This expression essentially says: the (p)-value is the probability that a random variable following a chi-square distribution with (DF) degrees of freedom takes a value greater than the observed (chi^2) statistic. # Calculation Methods In practice, calculating (p)-values for chi-square tests involves: - **Statistical Tables:** Pre-computed tables that give (p)-values for various combinations of chi-square statistics and degrees of freedom. - **Statistical Software:** Programs like R, Python (with libraries such as SciPy), SPSS, etc., can compute (p)-values very accurately for a wide range of test statistics and degrees of freedom. # Example Using Software In Python, you could calculate the (p)-value for a chi-square test statistic using the \`scipy.stats\` library: \`\`\`python import scipy.stats as stats chi2_statistic = 311.4 # Your chi2 statistic df = 4 # Degrees of freedom: k - 1, where k is the number of categories p_value = 1 - stats.chi2.cdf(chi2_statistic, df) print(\\"p-value:\\", p_value) \`\`\` This code calculates the (p)-value based on the chi-square cumulative distribution function, subtracting it from 1 to find the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed. # Note The practically zero (p)-value (\`p = 0.0001\`) suggests that the observed deviations from the expected frequencies (under the null hypothesis) are statistically significant, and thus, the null hypothesis can be rejected with high confidence. This interpretation is always in the context of a pre-set significance level ((alpha)), commonly (0.05), (0.01), etc."},{"prompt":"hand calculation","completion":"Calculating a (p)-value for a chi-square distribution by hand, without the aid of statistical tables, calculators, or software, is impractical due to the complex nature of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the chi-square distribution. Typically, the chi-square CDF can't be neatly expressed in a simple formula suitable for hand calculations, as it involves integrating the probability density function of the chi-square distribution, which is defined as: [ f(x; k) = frac{1}{2^{k/2}Gamma(k/2)}x^{k/2 - 1}e^{-x/2} ] where (x) is the chi-square statistic, (k) is the degrees of freedom, and (Gamma) is the gamma function. However, to understand the process of determining the (p)-value associated with a chi-square statistic, you would generally follow these steps (using tables or software): # Using Chi-square Tables (for Hand Calculation) Chi-square tables only allow you to get approximate (p)-values because they typically list only certain critical values of the chi-square statistic for various common significance levels ((0.05), (0.01), etc.) and degrees of freedom. 1. **Find or Set Your Significance Level ((α)):** This is your threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. Common values are (0.05), (0.01). 2. **Identify Degrees of Freedom (DF):** For a chi-square goodness of fit test, (DF = k - 1), where (k) is the number of categories. 3. **Use the Chi-square Table:** Locate the row that corresponds to your degrees of freedom. Follow this row to find where your chi-square statistic falls in relation to the table's critical values. - If your chi-square statistic is greater than the critical value listed for a specific (α), then the (p)-value is less than (α), indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected at that significance level. 4. **Interpolate if Necessary:** If your chi-square statistic falls between two values in the table, you have to interpolate to estimate the (p)-value. # Theoretical Example Say you have a chi-square statistic of (311.4) with (4) degrees of freedom. Chi-square tables don't typically list values this high because the corresponding (p)-values are so small that they fall below common significance thresholds. - For (DF = 4), the critical value for (α = 0.001) (a very low (p)-value threshold) might be around (18.467). - Since (311.4) is far greater than (18.467), you can conclude that your (p)-value is well below (0.001), implying very strong evidence against the null hypothesis. # Conclusion for Hand Calculations While hand calculations can guide you towards understanding the significance of your chi-square test statistic vis-a-vis critical values from statistical tables, they're not precise for finding exact (p)-values, especially for very high chi-square statistics like (311.4) where you'd rely on software or statistical calculators for an accurate (p)-value."},{"prompt":"переформулируй – дойти до финиша, т.е. осуществить все 4 стадии бюджетного процесса и довести проект бюджета до соответствующего закона, исполнить и проконтролировать его.","completion":"Пройти все этапы бюджетного процесса, завершить разработку проекта бюджета и привести его к принятию закона, организовать его выполнение и обеспечить контроль."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It integrates several key middleware and services, such as configuration management, logging, security enhancements, request rate limiting, and database connectivity. However, there are a few areas where improvements could be applied or considerations to ensure its generality and scalability across various projects. Here are some thoughts and recommendations: # General Observations 1. **Configuration Management**: You've integrated \`dotenv\` for environment variables and a \`config.json\` file for static configuration, which is good practice. However, consider centralizing configuration management. For instance, merging environment-specific configurations to override default settings conveniently. This centralization could aid in managing configurations across various environments (development, staging, production, etc.). 2. **Logger Utility**: The use of a custom logging mechanism (\`createLogger\`) is excellent for standardizing how logging is done across your application. Ensure your logger is configurable and supports different levels of logging (info, debug, warning, error) and possibly different output targets (console, file, external logging service). 3. **Database Management**: The MongoDB setup via \`MongoDBConnectionManager\` is project-specific. For a more general boilerplate, consider abstracting the database layer further to support different database types more transparently (SQL, NoSQL, etc.). 4. **Express Boilerplate Setup**: You've followed a solid structure for setting up middleware. For broader applications, consider abstracting middleware setup into individual modules or functions. This approach enhances readability and maintainability, enabling specific middleware configurations or swaps with minimal changes to the core logic. # Specific Suggestions - **Error Handling**: While you've included \`express-async-errors\` for cleaner async error handling, it would be beneficial to also define a global error handler middleware that catches any uncaught errors and responds accordingly. This can prevent the server from crashing on unhandled errors and provide a uniform error response structure. - **CORS Configuration**: Your current setup enables CORS for all origins. For production environments, you'll likely want to restrict this to certain origins for security reasons. - **Rate Limiting**: Your current rate limit configuration is a good start. Depending on the project, you might find the need to customize this further based on route or IP, especially if some areas of your application receive more traffic or require more stringent rate limiting. - **Security Headers with Helmet**: It is currently enabled with default settings, which is typically a good starting point. However, as projects evolve, some of the default Helmet policies might need adjustments to cater to specific project requirements (e.g., Content Security Policy). - **Middleware for Method Override**: This is project-specific, and its necessity varies. If you aim for RESTful APIs exclusively and control client implementations, you might not need \`method-override\`. - **Lock Management**: The lock manager utility (\`LockManager\`) suggests a specific use case (likely to prevent concurrent executions in certain scenarios). This might not be universally required across all your projects. # Overall Your start file is a strong foundation. With a few adjustments and modularization, it can serve as a flexible boilerplate for a wide range of projects. Always consider the specific requirements of a project and the necessity and impact of each component you include in your boilerplate."},{"prompt":"Middleware order: Consider rearranging the middleware order. Ideally, helmet and cors should be placed before the body parsers (express.json and express.urlencoded) for better protection.

The code snippet assumes the presence of this option in \`config.json\`. Adjust this according to your actual configuration setup or logging mechanism, ensuring that log verbosity can be managed across different environments. 3. **General Enhancements:** This revision maintains a clear, modular structure for initializing your express application without modifying its original intention. It integrates feedback for a more secure and manageable setup, ensuring the boilerplate can serve a wide variety of projects effectively."},{"prompt":"please do proper error handling and make this robust and scalable and generic","completion":"To make the provided boilerplate more robust and scalable, we will introduce proper error handling, add dynamic environment configuration, generalize database connections, and offer a more modular approach to middleware and routes.

Consider enhancing configuration with different profiles for development, testing, and production. 2. **Generalized Database Connection**: \`initializeDatabase\` is a modular function that abstracts away the specifics of database connection setup. This function should intelligently determine which database to connect to based on the environment configuration, thereby supporting multiple databases. 3. **Modular Error Handling**: \`createErrorHandler\` is middleware for capturing and logging errors. It also sends a generic response to the client, ensuring that no sensitive error details are leaked. 4. **Middleware and Routes**: This example abstracts the route setup to a \`loadRoutes\` utility function, which dynamically loads routes from a specific folder or configuration, making it easier to scale and manage as your project grows. 5. **Rate Limiting and Security**: Using middleware like \`helmet\` and \`cors\` enhances security. The \`rateLimit\` middleware is configured to avoid abuse, which can be adjusted based on the individual project needs. 6. **Logging**: Implementing a scalable logging solution that supports various levels and can log to different outputs (console, files, external services) is crucial for monitoring and debugging. # Final Thoughts: This approach sets a foundation for developing scalable and maintainable Node.js applications. By abstracting and modularizing components, you make it easier to adapt and grow your boilerplate, whether that means adding new features, swapping out databases, or changing the configuration for different environments. Remember, maintaining good documentation on how each part of your boilerplate works will also be invaluable as your project and team grow."},{"prompt":"now show me the complete file","completion":"Creating a complete, fully featured boilerplate file that includes every suggestion—like dynamic environment configuration, generalized database connection setup, modular error handling, and dynamic route loading—would exceed the space and scope allowed here.

Below are some considerations and enhancements for your \`Logger.js\` service: # 1. Environment-Specific Logging Levels Different environments (development, staging, production) often require varying levels of logging verbosity. Integrating environment-based logging levels enhances the logger's adaptability. # 2. Log Metadata Injecting metadata (like unique request identifiers) into the log entries can significantly improve traceability and debugging capabilities, especially in distributed systems. # 3. Centralized Configuration Having logging configurations (paths, levels, formats) centralized, possibly in a separate configuration file or environment variables, makes maintaining and adjusting the logger settings across different deployments easier. # 4. Error Stack Tracing Ensure that when logging errors, the stack trace is retained, making debugging more straightforward. # Enhanced \`Logger.js\` Incorporating the above suggestions, an enhanced version of your \`Logger.js\` could resemble: \`\`\`javascript const winston = require(\\"winston\\"); require(\\"winston-daily-rotate-file\\"); const path = require(\\"path\\"); const createLogger = (appName = \\"Application\\", logPath = \\"../logs\\") => { // Environment-specific log level const level = process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info'; // Define the log directory path const logDir = path.resolve(__dirname, logPath); // Common format for logs const logFormat = winston.format.combine( winston.format.timestamp({ format: \\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss\\" }), winston.format.errors({ stack: true }), // Include stack trace if available winston.format.json() ); // Create a logger instance return winston.createLogger({ level: level, format: logFormat, defaultMeta: { service: appName }, transports: [ new winston.transports.Console({ format: winston.format.combine( winston.format.colorize(), // Only colorize in console winston.format.simple() // Simpler format for console readability ), }), new winston.transports.DailyRotateFile({ filename: \`{appName}-%DATE%.log\`, dirname: logDir, datePattern: \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\", zippedArchive: true, maxSize: \\"20m\\", maxFiles: \\"14d\\", }), ], }); }; module.exports = createLogger; \`\`\` # Explanation of Enhancements: - **Environment-Specific Logging Levels**: The logger adapts its verbosity level based on an environment variable.

The use of \`winston.format.errors({ stack: true })\` ensures that error logs are informative. - **Console Log Formatting**: For development environments, console logs are colorized and simplified for better readability. This dual-format approach maintains operational visibility while ensuring that file-based logs are structured and comprehensive.

This logger can be a versatile tool for various projects, given its thoughtful setup. Here's a review with suggestions to further enhance its robustness and utility: # Key Highlights and Suggestions 1. **Log Path Flexibility**: Your logger smartly resolves the \`logPath\` relative to the current working directory of the Node.js process, which adds considerable flexibility in defining log locations. Ensure the chosen log path is always writable. 2. **Metadata Handling**: Adding metadata proves beneficial for contextual logging, especially when debugging complex issues. Consider adding more details about how to efficiently incorporate and use metadata within the application's logging messages. 3. **Print Format Clarity**: Your \`printf\` customization enriches the log output. This approach balances readability for human viewers and structured data for machine parsing. You might want to keep an eye on the log size, as verbose metadata can lead to large log files. 4. **Exception Logging**: Setting up separate handlers for exceptions is a proactive measure for catching and logging unhandled exceptions. This dual setup ensures that even uncaught exceptions do not go unnoticed. 5. **Documentation**: Providing parameter descriptions in the JSDoc comment is good practice, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Consider also documenting an example usage for future reference or new team members. 6. **Environment-Specific Logging Levels**: You've included \`logLevel\` as a parameter with a default of \\"info\\", which is practical. To further increase versatility, consider tying this parameter to environment variables, offering an easy switch between verbose debug logging in development and more succinct logging in production. 7. **Rotation Strategy Enhancement**: The use of \`winston-daily-rotate-file\` for log rotation addresses many concerns related to log file management (like file size and archiving). Continuously monitor if the current settings (\`maxSize: \\"20m\\"\`, \`maxFiles: \\"14d\\"\`) align with your infrastructure's disk capacity and retention policies. Adjustments may be needed based on actual log volume and compliance requirements. 8. **Transport Configuration Duplication**: There seems to be a repetition in defining the format for both Console and File transports, and again for exception handlers. To DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) your code, you could define these settings once and reuse them, especially the format and filename patterns. 9. **Syslog Levels**: Winston supports syslog levels which can be beneficial if your logs are integrated into a system-wide log management solution. Consider if adopting syslog levels could align better with your infrastructure's logging strategies. # Final Thoughts Your implementation showcases a deep understanding of the needs surrounding application logging. It’s a solid base that you can iteratively refine as its real-world use uncovers new requirements or as your applications evolve.

This setup contributes significantly to both development-time insights and production-level observability. Here are a few additional thoughts for enhancement and considerations: # Further Refinements and Considerations 1. **Colorize Based on Environment**: You're combining \`winston.format.colorize()\` with your \`logFormat\` for console transports, which is great for development environments. However, in production, log readability in consoles or log management tools might benefit from disabling colorization to avoid ANSI codes cluttering the logs. Consider conditionally applying \`colorize\` based on the NODE_ENV environment variable or a specific logger configuration. \`\`\`javascript const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'; const consoleFormat = isDevelopment ? winston.format.combine(winston.format.colorize(), logFormat) : logFormat; \`\`\` 2. **Timestamp Formats and Log Management Systems**: The timestamp format \`\\"DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:ss\\"\` suits human readability. Yet, if your logs are ingested by log management systems or time series databases, you might find ISO 8601 \`(\\"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ\\")\` more universally compatible, especially for systems that rely on precise time parsing across different locales and time zones. 3. **Error Handling**: Your handling of exceptions is a significant plus, especially directing them to both the console and a dedicated file. This practice ensures critical issues are noticed and recorded. To further this approach, consider also listening to \`unhandledRejection\` events to capture Promise rejections that weren't explicitly handled. \`\`\`javascript process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { logger.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason); }); \`\`\` 4. **Security and Privacy**: When logging metadata or error details, remember to filter out sensitive information that should not be stored in logs, such as passwords or personal identification information. You could enrich your logging format or implement custom log sanitization functions to achieve this. 5. **Performance Considerations**: Logging, especially at verbose levels, can impact application performance. It's wise to benchmark your application's performance with logging at various levels and adjust according to the criticality of log messages. Tools like \`winston\` support dynamic log level changes, which can be harnessed to adjust verbosity in real-time based on performance metrics or operational needs. 6. **Documentation and Examples**: As you finalize your logger utility, consider adding a README file or inline documentation explaining its use, configuration options, and examples of both simple and advanced usage. This helps ensure that all team members can effectively utilize logging in their projects, and facilitates consistency across different applications. By addressing these additional points, your logger service not only maintains its practicality and robustness but also aligns with operational best practices and adaptability requirements of modern Node.js applications."},{"prompt":"const winston = require(\\"winston\\"); require(\\"winston-daily-rotate-file\\"); const path = require(\\"path\\"); /** * Create a customizable logger. * @param {string} appName - The name of the application. * @param {string} [logPath=\\"\\"] - The path where logs should be stored (optional, default is the root folder of the project). * @param {string} [logLevel=\\"info\\"] - The log level (optional, default is \\"info\\"). * @returns {winston.Logger} A configured logger instance. */ const createLogger = (appName = \\"ApplicationName\\", logPath = \\"\\", logLevel = \\"info\\") => { // Resolve the log directory path relative to the current working directory const logDir = path.resolve(process.cwd(), logPath); // Define log format const logFormat = winston.format.combine( winston.format.metadata(), // Add metadata to log entries winston.format.timestamp({ format: \\"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ\\" }), // ISO 8601 timestamp format winston.format.printf(info => { const { timestamp, level, message, metadata } = info; let log = \`{timestamp} [{level.toUpperCase()}]: {message}\`; if (metadata) { log += \`n{JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2)}\`; } return log; }) ); // Determine if colorization should be applied based on environment const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'; const consoleFormat = isDevelopment ? winston.format.combine(winston.format.colorize(), logFormat) : logFormat; // Create transports const transports = [ new winston.transports.Console({ format: consoleFormat }), new winston.transports.DailyRotateFile({ format: logFormat, filename: path.join(logDir, \`{appName}-%DATE%.log\`), datePattern: \\"YYYY-MM-DD\\", zippedArchive: true, maxSize: \\"20m\\", maxFiles: \\"14d\\", }), ]; // Exception handling transports.forEach(transport => { if (transport.handleExceptions) { transport.handleExceptions = true; transport.exitOnError = false; } }); // Create a logger const logger = winston.createLogger({ level: logLevel, format: logFormat, transports: transports, }); // Handle unhandled promise rejections process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { logger.error('Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason); }); // Return the configured logger instance return logger; }; module.exports = createLogger;","completion":"Your improved \`createLogger\` function embodies several best practices for logging in Node.js applications, making effective use of the \`winston\` package and its \`winston-daily-rotate-file\` plugin for log rotation. This logger is well-prepared for diverse development scenarios, offering configurability and attention to operational detail. Below is an analysis of the enhancements and additional fine-tuning suggestions: # Analysis of Enhancements - **ISO 8601 Timestamps**: Adopting the ISO 8601 format for timestamps is an excellent choice for global applicability and consistency, especially when logs might be ingested by different systems across time zones. - **Environment-Specific Colorization**: Adding conditional colorization based on the environment improves log readability during development without compromising log clarity in production environments, where color codes can clutter log files. - **Centralized Unhandled Rejections Handling**: Incorporating a mechanism to catch and log unhandled promise rejections directly within the logging setup ensures these critical errors don't go unnoticed, enhancing the reliability of your error reporting. # Additional Fine-Tuning and Considerations 1. **Selective Metadata Logging**: Currently, all metadata attached to log messages will be serialized and logged. Depending on the volume and nature of metadata, you might want to introduce filters or selectors to determine which pieces of metadata are relevant to avoid logging potentially sensitive or unnecessary information. 2. **Logging Performance and Impact**: Given the potentially significant impact of logging on application performance, especially with detailed or verbose logging levels, continuously monitor and evaluate the performance impact. Consider implementing dynamic log level switching through runtime configuration (if not already in place) to allow for on-the-fly verbosity adjustments. 3. **Integration with Monitoring and Alerting Tools**: If you haven't already, exploring and documenting potential integrations of your created logger with monitoring and alerting tools would be beneficial. This could include forwarding logs to a centralized logging service, integrating with an application performance monitoring (APM) solution, or setting up alerts based on specific log patterns or error frequencies. 4. **Log File Management and Retention Policy**: The current setup with \`maxFiles: \\"14d\\"\` establishes a basic retention policy based on time. Depending on operational requirements and data regulations (such as GDPR in Europe), you may need to refine this policy, including considerations around log rotation, archival strategies, and secure deletion practices. 5. **Documentation and Usage Examples**: Expanding the inline documentation and providing a README file or similar documentation with examples of typical usage, configuration options, and advice on integrating the logger into applications would be invaluable. This is especially true for larger teams or when the logger is intended to be reused across multiple projects. 6. **Review of Transport Options for Scalability**: While the current setup covers console and file transports with daily rotation, larger-scale applications or microservices architectures might benefit from additional transport mechanisms, such as logging to a centralized log management service, using a transport compatible with Elasticsearch, or integrating with cloud-native logging solutions. By addressing these considerations, your logging solution can evolve into a more comprehensive, flexible, and robust tool, capable of supporting the needs of complex, scalable applications while ensuring operational visibility and reliability."},{"prompt":"some times if we are logging some json objects or arrays it was printing like [object, object]","completion":"The issue of logging JSON objects or arrays and having them appear as \`[object Object]\` in the log output is a common concern when working with JavaScript logging. This issue typically arises because the logging library or the method being used to concatenate the object or array with a string doesn't automatically serialize the object to a string. Instead, it calls the \`.toString()\` method on the object, which results in the unhelpful \`[object Object]\` output. Here's how to address this issue within the context of the enhanced \`createLogger\` function using \`winston\` that you have set up: # Ensuring Proper Serialization in Log Messages To ensure that objects and arrays are serialized (converted to a string representation) correctly in your log messages, you can modify the \`printf\` part of your log format to check if \`metadata\` contains an object or array and use \`JSON.stringify\` to serialize it properly. Here is a revised snippet for the \`logFormat\`: \`\`\`javascript const logFormat = winston.format.combine( winston.format.metadata(), winston.format.timestamp({ format: \\"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ\\" }), winston.format.printf(info => { const { timestamp, level, message, metadata } = info; let log = \`{timestamp} [{level.toUpperCase()}]: {message}\`; if (metadata && Object.keys(metadata).length) { // Check if metadata needs to be serialized const serializedMetadata = typeof metadata === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(metadata, null, 2) : metadata; log += \`nMetadata: {serializedMetadata}\`; } return log; }) ); \`\`\` This adjustment ensures that if \`metadata\` is an object (which includes arrays), it's serialized with \`JSON.stringify\` for a more meaningful output in the logs. The \`null\` and \`2\` arguments in \`JSON.stringify\` are used for formatting the output JSON with indentation, making it more readable. # Additional Tips for Logging Objects and Arrays - **Avoiding Performance Hits**: Serializing large objects or arrays can be performance-intensive. Use this feature judiciously, especially in production environments or high-throughput scenarios. - **Filtering Sensitive Information**: When automatically serializing objects, ensure that you do not log sensitive information. You might want to implement a filtering mechanism to exclude certain keys from being logged. - **Custom Serialization Functions**: For complex objects or to exclude specific sensitive data from being logged, consider writing custom serialization functions that transform your objects into log-friendly structures. Implementing these suggestions in your \`createLogger\` setup will help mitigate issues with logging objects and arrays, making your application logs more informative and useful for debugging and monitoring purposes."},{"prompt":"user should access barq payment approvals and view all his payments. inform the user what he is viewing and what the list of payments are (These are your payment request by other Barq users). add search function for user (BAU - quickpay) show request by date .

Пчелы нуждаются в доступе к растениям и цветам для сбора нектара и пыльцы, поэтому они не смогут выжить внутри помещения без свободного доступа на улицу. Еще одной проблемой является возможное загрязнение помещения и распространение болезней, которые могут быть переданы через ульи. Что касается сахарного сиропа, пчелы обычно питаются нектаром, который они собирают с растений. Сахарный сироп может быть использован как дополнительное питание для пчел в случае нехватки нектара, но лучше всего консультироваться с опытным пчеловодом или профессионалом перед принятием решения о добавлении сиропа в питание пчел. В любом случае, улей с пчелами лучше разместить на открытой территории с соблюдением всех необходимых мер безопасности и ухода за пчелами."},{"prompt":"А на балконе?","completion":"Размещение улья с пчелами на балконе может быть более реальным вариантом, чем внутри квартиры, но все же есть несколько важных аспектов, которые стоит учитывать. 1. Доступ к растениям: Пчелы нуждаются в доступе к растениям для сбора нектара и пыльцы. Убедитесь, что на вашем балконе есть достаточно цветов и растений, чтобы пчелы могли собирать пищу. 2. Место размещения: Важно выбрать местоположение на балконе, где улей будет находиться в безопасном месте и не будет мешать соседям. 3. Безопасность: Помните о безопасности себя и других. Пчелы могут агрессивно реагировать на возмущения и укусить человека. Убедитесь, что улей хорошо защищен и что вы знаете, как вести себя рядом с ним. 4. Сахарный сироп: Если вы хотите добавить сахарный сироп в питание пчел, это должно делаться с учетом конкретных рекомендаций и дозировок. Важно не переусердствовать с подобными добавками. Перед решением установить улей с пчелами на балконе, лучше проконсультироваться с опытным пчеловодом или специалистом, чтобы убедиться, что вы готовы к этому и у вас есть все необходимые знания и инструменты для ухода за пчелами."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","completion":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Раньше молочная кислота ассоциировалась исключительно с мышечной усталостью и болевыми ощущениями после интенсивных тренировок. Однако современные результаты исследований показывают, что молочная кислота может оказывать положительное влияние на рост и восстановление мышечной ткани. Механизмы, через которые молочная кислота может способствовать росту мышц, включают следующие аспекты: 1. **Стимуляция релиза гормонов роста**: Некоторые исследования показали, что накопление лактата в мышцах во время интенсивных тренировок может способствовать высвобождению гормонов роста, которые в свою очередь играют ключевую роль в росте и восстановлении мышечной ткани. 2. **Улучшение поглощения глюкозы мышцами**: Молочная кислота может помогать улучшить способность мышц поглощать глюкозу, которая является важным источником энергии в процессе восстановления и роста мышц. 3. **Регуляция клеточного окружения**: Лактат может способствовать оптимизации кислотно-щелочного баланса в мышцах, создавая благоприятные условия для их роста и восстановления. Стоит отметить, что перспективы и влияние молочной кислоты в контексте тренировок и роста мышц все еще активно изучаются, и постоянно появляются новые данные. Важно понимать, что влияние молочной кислоты может значительно отличаться в зависимости от индивидуальных физиологических особенностей человека, интенсивности и типа физической активности. Несмотря на потенциально положительное влияние молочной кислоты, важно сбалансированно подходить к тренировочному процессу, включая адекватный отдых, восстановление и питание, чтобы максимизировать результаты и избежать перетренированности и поражения мышечных волокон."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

According to the legend, the sea creature was once a man who was thrown overboard by his shipmates. His spirit still lives on, searching for victims so he can steal their soul. The gang heads to the Mystery Machine to call the police, where they discover that it has been ransacked by the monster. They follow his footsteps back to the house, where they discover that Captain Clements has had his soul removed by the monster. Fred, Velma and Daphne head back to the beach to look for clues, while Shaggy and Scooby stay at the house.

The gang hide in the torpedo room, where Fred devises a scheme to capture the creature and Captain Clements. The plan is a success, but they accidentally capture Scooby Doo in the process. The police are then called and the monsters are revealed. Captain Clements was the mastermind behind the entire crime. He was helping criminals escape the country through the ship. Prisoners would dress up as the monster to scare people away. Captain Clements was never possessed; he used the light signal to let prisoners know when he was ready to ship them. The sea creature costume had a jet motor in it, enabling the criminal to quickly swim out to the sub, were Captain Clements would be waiting to change the criminals appearance and give them false identification papers, then the criminals would be taken out of the country on the ship.

They arrive by boat, during which they spotted a huge owl, making a horrible screeching sound and flying through the air. The gang arrive to Uncle Dave's lodge, and find it deserted and ransacked. While they are there, Scooby claims to see two huge owls outside the window. After going outside, some people from the local Chippewa tribe come by, one of them being tribe's chief, a man named Red Herron. Velma explains to Red Herron and the others with him about her uncle, Dave Walton, and Red Herron, who claims to be friends with Velma's uncle, explains that Velma's uncle was taken away by the Willawaw, a legendary creature. The Willawaw is said to be a fiery beast that swoops down to take away those whose names have been called by an owl. Red Herron warns the gang to leave, but they stay to solve the mystery and find Velma's uncle. Scooby and Shaggy spend the night on the boat, while Fred and the girls stay at Dave's cabin. While the cowardly duo is out on the boat, they hear an owl saying Scooby's name, so the Willawaw appears and begins chasing them. Scooby accidentally starts the boat and they end up in a nearby sea cave. Meanwhile, Fred and the girls walk to the cave to find Shaggy and Scooby. Velma finds a native American pictograph in the dirt, a sign for danger, which she believes was made by her uncle. Fred and the girls are then chased by two life-size owl men. They end up hiding in a room stocked full of kerosene and sandbags. Shaggy and Scooby are searching the same cave, where they discover a room full of fur coats, TVs, and other artifacts. They also discover some suits that look like owls, which they decide to put on. Fred and the girls decide to capture the owl men, only to accidentally capture Shaggy and Scooby. They tell Fred and the girls about the treasures they found in the cave, giving them the final clue to solve the mystery. The Gang decide to trap the Willawaw and the owl men. After they successfully do so, the culprits are revealed: Grey Fox, one of the Native Americans from the local reservation, and two of his henchmen. The Willawaw was actually a jet-powered helium balloon controlled by Grey Fox, and the jet engine was what made those horrible screeching sounds. As it turns out, all the loot that was found in the caves were stolen items that were being sold through a smuggling ring run by Grey Fox, and that the ring went all the way up to Canada. Velma's uncle eventually shows up with Chief Red Herron--Velma's happy to see that her uncle is safe, and Dave explains to his niece and her friends that Red Herron rescued him and that he had been kidnapped and locked up by Grey Fox and his men after discovering what they were doing and was hot on their trail. Chief Red Herron explains that he'll take Grey Fox and his cohorts to their tribe council elders and have them decide on a proper punishment for the culprits. As they walk home, Dave tells the gang they're going to celebrate when they arrive at the cabin. While walking an Owl says Scooby's name. Scooby attempts to scare it, but the owl scares him with a loud howl which causes Scooby to run up a tree, and everyone laughs.","completion":"[The gang is cruising towards the Native American reservation in their groovy boat.

Since language has a natural sequential ordering, it is common to factorize the joint prob￾ability over the whole sequence as the product of conditional probabilities (a.k.a. autoregressive decomposition [3]): 𝑃 (𝑥) = 𝑃 (𝑥1) · 𝑃 (𝑥2 | 𝑥1) · · · 𝑃 (𝑥𝑛 | 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛−1). (1) Transformers [53] have become the de facto standard ar￾chitecture for modeling the probability above at a large scale. The most important component of a Transformer-based lan￾guage model is its self-attention layers. For an input hidden state sequence (𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) ∈ R 𝑛×𝑑 , a self-attention layer first applies linear transformations on each position 𝑖 to get the query, key, and value vectors: 𝑞𝑖 = 𝑊𝑞𝑥𝑖 , 𝑘𝑖 = 𝑊𝑘𝑥𝑖 , 𝑣𝑖 = 𝑊𝑣𝑥𝑖 . (2) Then, the self-attention layer computes the attention score 𝑎𝑖𝑗 by multiplying the query vector at one position with all the key vectors before it and compute the output 𝑜𝑖 as the weighted average over the value vectors: 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = exp(𝑞 ⊤ 𝑖 𝑘𝑗 / √ 𝑑) Í𝑖 𝑡=1 exp(𝑞 ⊤ 𝑖 𝑘𝑡 / √ 𝑑) , 𝑜𝑖 = ∑︁ 𝑖 𝑗=1 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑣𝑗 . (3) Besides the computation in Eq. 4, all other components in the Transformer model, including the embedding layer, feed-forward layer, layer normalization [2], residual connec￾tion [22], output logit computation, and the query, key, and value transformation in Eq. 2, are all applied independently position-wise in a form of 𝑦𝑖 = 𝑓 (𝑥𝑖). 2.2 LLM Service & Autoregressive Generation Once trained, LLMs are often deployed as a conditional gen￾eration service (e.g., completion API [34] or chatbot [19, 35]). A request to an LLM service provides a list of input prompt tokens (𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛), and the LLM service generates a list of output tokens (𝑥𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛+𝑇 ) according to Eq. 1. We refer to the concatenation of the prompt and output lists as sequence. Due to the decomposition in Eq. 1, the LLM can only sam￾ple and generate new tokens one by one, and the generation process of each new token depends on all the previous tokens in that sequence, specifically their key and value vectors. In this sequential generation process, the key and value vectors of existing tokens are often cached for generating future tokens, known as KV cache. Note that the KV cache of one token depends on all its previous tokens. This means that the KV cache of the same token appearing at different positions in a sequence will be different. Given a request prompt, the generation computation in the LLM service can be decomposed into two phases: The prompt phase takes the whole user prompt (𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) as input and computes the probability of the first new to￾ken 𝑃 (𝑥𝑛+1 | 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛). During this process, also gener￾ates the key vectors 𝑘1, . . . , 𝑘𝑛 and value vectors 𝑣1, . . . , 𝑣𝑛. Since prompt tokens 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛 are all known, the computa￾tion of the prompt phase can be parallelized using matrix￾matrix multiplication operations. Therefore, this phase can efficiently use the parallelism inherent in GPUs. The autoregressive generation phase generates the re￾maining new tokens sequentially. At iteration 𝑡, the model takes one token 𝑥𝑛+𝑡 as input and computes the probability 𝑃 (𝑥𝑛+𝑡+1 | 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛+𝑡) with the key vectors 𝑘1, . . . , 𝑘𝑛+𝑡 and value vectors𝑣1, . . . , 𝑣𝑛+𝑡 . Note that the key and value vectors at positions 1 to 𝑛 + 𝑡 − 1 are cached at previous iterations, only the new key and value vector 𝑘𝑛+𝑡 and 𝑣𝑛+𝑡 are com￾puted at this iteration. This phase completes either when the sequence reaches a maximum length (specified by users or limited by LLMs) or when an end-of-sequence (<eos>) token is emitted. The computation at different iterations cannot be parallelized due to the data dependency and often uses matrix-vector multiplication, which is less efficient. As a re￾sult, this phase severely underutilizes GPU computation and becomes memory-bound, being responsible for most portion of the latency of a single request. 2.3 Batching Techniques for LLMs The compute utilization in serving LLMs can be improved by batching multiple requests. Because the requests share the same model weights, the overhead of moving weights is amortized across the requests in a batch, and can be over￾whelmed by the computational overhead when the batch size is sufficiently large. However, batching the requests to an LLM service is non-trivial for two reasons. First, the requests may arrive at different times. A naive batching strat￾egy would either make earlier requests wait for later ones or delay the incoming requests until earlier ones finish, lead￾ing to significant queueing delays. Second, the requests may have vastly different input and output lengths (Fig. 11). A straightforward batching technique would pad the inputs and outputs of the requests to equalize their lengths, wasting GPU computation and memory. To address this problem, fine-grained batching mecha￾nisms, such as cellular batching [16] and iteration-level sched￾uling [60], have been proposed. Unlike traditional methods that work at the request level, these techniques operate at the iteration level. After each iteration, completed requests are removed from the batch, and new ones are added. There￾fore, a new request can be processed after waiting for a single iteration, not waiting for the entire batch to complete. Moreover, with special GPU kernels, these techniques elim￾inate the need to pad the inputs and outputs. By reducing the queueing delay and the inefficiencies from padding, the fine-grained batching mechanisms significantly increase the throughput of LLM serving.3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving Although fine-grained batching reduces the waste of com￾puting and enables requests to be batched in a more flexible way, the number of requests that can be batched together is still constrained by GPU memory capacity, particularly the space allocated to store the KV cache. In other words, the serving system’s throughput is memory-bound. Overcom￾ing this memory-bound requires addressing the following challenges in the memory management: Large KV cache. The KV Cache size grows quickly with the number of requests. As an example, for the 13B parameter OPT model [62], the KV cache of a single token demands 800 KB of space, calculated as 2 (key and value vectors) × 5120 (hidden state size) × 40 (number of layers) × 2 (bytes per FP16). Since OPT can generate sequences up to 2048 tokens, the memory required to store the KV cache of one request can be as much as 1.6 GB. Concurrent GPUs have memory capacities in the tens of GBs. Even if all available memory was allocated to KV cache, only a few tens of requests could be accommodated. Moreover, inefficient memory manage￾ment can further decrease the batch size, as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, given the current trends, the GPU’s computa￾tion speed grows faster than the memory capacity [17]. For example, from NVIDIA A100 to H100, The FLOPS increases by more than 2x, but the GPU memory stays at 80GB max￾imum. Therefore, we believe the memory will become an increasingly significant bottleneck. Complex decoding algorithms. LLM services offer a range of decoding algorithms for users to select from, each with varying implications for memory management complexity. For example, when users request multiple random samples from a single input prompt, a typical use case in program suggestion [18], the KV cache of the prompt part, which accounts for 12% of the total KV cache memory in our ex￾periment (§6.3), can be shared to minimize memory usage. On the other hand, the KV cache during the autoregressive generation phase should remain unshared due to the dif￾ferent sample results and their dependence on context and position. The extent of KV cache sharing depends on the specific decoding algorithm employed. In more sophisticated algorithms like beam search [49], different request beams can share larger portions (up to 55% memory saving, see §6.3) of their KV cache, and the sharing pattern evolves as the decoding process advances. Scheduling for unknown input & output lengths. The requests to an LLM service exhibit variability in their input and output lengths. This requires the memory management system to accommodate a wide range of prompt lengths. In addition, as the output length of a request grows at decoding, the memory required for its KV cache also expands and may exhaust available memory for incoming requests or ongoing generation for existing prompts. The system needs to make scheduling decisions, such as deleting or swapping out the KV cache of some requests from GPU memory. 3.1 Memory Management in Existing Systems Since most operators in current deep learning frameworks [33, 39] require tensors to be stored in contiguous memory, previous LLM serving systems [31, 60] also store the KV cache of one request as a contiguous tensor across the differ￾ent positions. Due to the unpredictable output lengths from the LLM, they statically allocate a chunk of memory for a request based on the request’s maximum possible sequence length, irrespective of the actual input or eventual output length of the request. Fig. 3 illustrates two requests: request A with 2048 max￾imum possible sequence length and request B with a max￾imum of 512. The chunk pre-allocation scheme in existing systems has three primary sources of memory wastes: re￾served slots for future tokens, internal fragmentation due to over-provisioning for potential maximum sequence lengths, and external fragmentation from the memory allocator like the buddy allocator. The external fragmentation will never be used for generated tokens, which is known before serving a request. Internal fragmentation also remains unused, but this is only realized after a request has finished sampling. They are both pure memory waste. Although the reserved memory is eventually used, reserving this space for the en￾tire request’s duration, especially when the reserved space is large, occupies the space that could otherwise be used to process other requests. We visualize the average percentage of memory wastes in our experiments in Fig. 2, revealing that the actual effective memory in previous systems can be as low as 20.4%Although compaction [54] has been proposed as a poten￾tial solution to fragmentation, performing compaction in a performance-sensitive LLM serving system is impractical due to the massive KV cache. Even with compaction, the pre-allocated chunk space for each request prevents memory sharing specific to decoding algorithms in existing memory management systems.","completion":"The article section provided discusses the background, operation, and memory management challenges of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their generation, serving, and scheduling processes. Here's a summary of each subsection: # 2 Background This section introduces the fundamental concepts and processes involved in generating and serving responses using Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on iteration-level scheduling during LLM service. # 2.1 Transformer-Based Large Language Models - Language modeling aims to predict the probability of a sequence of tokens, utilizing the autoregressive decomposition to factorize the joint probability into a product of conditional probabilities. - Transformers are the standard architecture for LLMs, primarily due to their self-attention layers, which calculate attention scores and outputs based on the input hidden state sequence. Other components, such as the embedding layer and feed-forward layer, are applied independently across positions. # 2.2 LLM Service & Autoregressive Generation - LLMs are deployed for conditional generation services like completion APIs or chatbots. These services take a list of input tokens and generate output tokens sequentially, relying on the computed probability distributions and the caching of key and value vectors (KV cache) for efficiency. - The generation process includes a prompt phase, which computes probabilities for the first new token in a parallelizable manner, and an autoregressive phase, which sequentially generates the remaining tokens in a more computationally and memory-intensive process. # 2.3 Batching Techniques for LLMs - To improve compute utilization during LLM servicing, batching multiple requests can be effective. However, challenges arise due to the staggered arrival of requests and varying request sizes. - Fine-grained batching mechanisms, such as cellular batching and iteration-level scheduling, address these issues by operating at the iteration level, allowing for dynamic adjustment of batches, thereby increasing throughput and reducing computational waste. # 3 Memory Challenges in LLM Serving Despite the advantages of fine-grained batching, LLM servicing remains constrained by GPU memory capacity, especially due to the space needed for the KV cache. The section outlines the challenges in managing memory for LLM serving: - **Large KV cache**: The size of the KV cache grows with the number of requests, quickly consuming the available GPU memory. - **Complex decoding algorithms**: Different decoding algorithms require varying memory management strategies, with some allowing for KV cache sharing to reduce memory usage. - **Scheduling for unknown input & output lengths**: The variability in request sizes and the gradual increase in memory needs during decoding necessitate sophisticated memory management to optimize throughput. # 3.1 Memory Management in Existing Systems - Current LLM systems often allocate memory based on the maximum possible sequence length for a request, leading to inefficiencies including reserved, internal, and external fragmentation. - The article discusses the downsides of pre-allocating memory chunks for each request, such as wastage due to over-provisioning and the inability to share memory across requests. Compaction is mentioned as a potential, yet impractical, solution to reduce fragmentation. In essence, the article highlights the operational details of LLMs, with a particular focus on the computational and memory management challenges inherent in their current serving and scheduling mechanisms."},{"prompt":"4 Method In this work, we develop a new attention algorithm, Page￾dAttention, and build an LLM serving engine, vLLM, to tackle the challenges outlined in §3. The architecture of vLLM is shown in Fig. 4. vLLM adopts a centralized scheduler to coordinate the execution of distributed GPU workers. The KV cache manager effectively manages the KV cache in a paged fashion, enabled by PagedAttention. Specifically, the KV cache manager manages the physical KV cache memory on the GPU workers through the instructions sent by the centralized scheduler. Next, We describe the PagedAttention algorithm in §4.1. With that, we show the design of the KV cache manager in §4.2 and how it facilitates PagedAttention in §4.3, respec￾tively. Then, we show how this design facilitates effective memory management for various decoding methods (§4.4) and handles the variable length input and output sequences (§4.5). Finally, we show how the system design of vLLM works in a distributed setting (§4.6). 4.1 PagedAttention To address the memory challenges in §3, we introduce Page￾dAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classic idea of paging [25] in operating systems. Unlike the traditional attention algorithms, PagedAttention allows storing continu￾ous keys and values in non-contiguous memory space. Specif￾ically, PagedAttention partitions the KV cache of each se￾quence into KV blocks. Each block contains the key and value vectors for a fixed number of tokens,1 which we denote as KV block size (𝐵). Denote the key block 𝐾𝑗 = (𝑘(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑘𝑗𝐵) and value block 𝑉𝑗 = (𝑣(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑣𝑗𝐵). The attention com￾putation in Eq. 4 can be transformed into the following block￾wise computation: 𝐴𝑖𝑗 = exp(𝑞 ⊤ 𝑖 𝐾𝑗 / √ 𝑑) Í⌈𝑖/𝐵⌉ 𝑡=1 exp(𝑞 ⊤ 𝑖 𝐾𝑡 1/ √ 𝑑) , 𝑜𝑖 = ⌈ ∑︁ 𝑖/𝐵⌉ 𝑗=1 𝑉𝑗𝐴 ⊤ 𝑖𝑗, (4) where 𝐴𝑖𝑗 = (𝑎𝑖,(𝑗−1)𝐵+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖,𝑗𝐵) is the row vector of atten￾tion score on 𝑗-th KV block. During the attention computation, the PagedAttention kernel identifies and fetches different KV blocks separately. We show an example of PagedAttention in Fig. 5: The key and value vectors are spread across three blocks, and the three blocks are not contiguous on the physical memory. At each time, the kernel multiplies the query vector 𝑞𝑖 of the query token (“forth”) and the key vectors 𝐾𝑗 in a block (e.g., key vectors of “Four score and seven” for block 0) to compute the attention score𝐴𝑖𝑗, and later multiplies𝐴𝑖𝑗 with the value vectors 𝑉𝑗 in a block to derive the final attention output 𝑜𝑖 . In summary, the PagedAttention algorithm allows the KV blocks to be stored in non-contiguous physical memory, which enables more flexible paged memory management in vLLM. 4.2 KV Cache Manager The key idea behind vLLM’s memory manager is analogous to the virtual memory [25] in operating systems. OS parti￾tions memory into fixed-sized pages and maps user programs’ logical pages to physical pages. Contiguous logical pages can correspond to non-contiguous physical memory pages, al￾lowing user programs to access memory as though it were contiguous. Moreover, physical memory space needs not to be fully reserved in advance, enabling the OS to dynamically allocate physical pages as needed. vLLM uses the ideas be￾hind virtual memory to manage the KV cache in an LLM service. Enabled by PagedAttention, we organize the KV cache as fixed-size KV blocks, like pages in virtual memory. A request’s KV cache is represented as a series of logical KV blocks, filled from left to right as new tokens and their KV cache are generated. The last KV block’s unfilled positions are reserved for future generations. On GPU workers, a block engine allocates a contiguous chunk of GPU DRAM and divides it into physical KV blocks (this is also done on CPU RAM for swapping; see §4.5). The KV block manager also maintains block tables—the mapping between logical and physical KV blocks of each request. Each block table entry records the corresponding physical blocks of a logical block and the number of filled positions. Separating logical and physical KV blocks allows vLLM to dynamically grow the KV cache memory without reserving it for all positions in advance, which eliminates most memory waste in existing systems, as in Fig. 2. 4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM Next, we walk through an example, as in Fig. 6, to demon￾strate how vLLM executes PagedAttention and manages the memory during the decoding process of a single input se￾quence: ○1 As in OS’s virtual memory, vLLM does not require reserving the memory for the maximum possible generated sequence length initially. Instead, it reserves only the nec￾essary KV blocks to accommodate the KV cache generated during prompt computation. In this case, The prompt has 7 tokens, so vLLM maps the first 2 logical KV blocks (0 and 1) to 2 physical KV blocks (7 and 1, respectively). In the prefill step, vLLM generates the KV cache of the prompts and the first output token with a conventional self-attention algorithm (e.g., [13]). vLLM then stores the KV cache of the first 4 tokens in logical block 0 and the following 3 tokens in logical block 1. The remaining slot is reserved for the subsequent autoregressive generation phase. ○2 In the first autoregressive decoding step, vLLM generates the new token with the PagedAttention algorithm on physical blocks 7 and 1. Since one slot remains available in the last logical block, the newly generated KV cache is stored there, and the block table’s #filled record is updated. ○3 At the second decoding step, as the last logical block is full, vLLM stores the newly generated KV cache in a new logical block; vLLM allocates a new physical block (physical block 3) for it and stores this mapping in the block table. Globally, for each decoding iteration, vLLM first selects a set of candidate sequences for batching (more in §4.5), and allocates the physical blocks for the newly required logical blocks. Then, vLLM concatenates all the input tokens of the current iteration (i.e., all tokens for prompt phase requests and the latest tokens for generation phase requests) as one sequence and feeds it into the LLM. During LLM’s computation, vLLM uses the PagedAttention kernel to access the previous KV cache stored in the form of logical KV blocks and saves the newly generated KV cache into the physical KV blocks. Storing multiple tokens within a KV block (block size > 1) enables the PagedAttention kernel to process the KV cache across more positions in parallel, thus increasing the hardware utilization and reducing latency. However, a larger block size also increases memory fragmentation. We study the effect of block size in §7.2. Again, vLLM dynamically assigns new physical blocks to logical blocks as more tokens and their KV cache are gener￾ated. As all the blocks are filled from left to right and a new physical block is only allocated when all previous blocks are full, vLLM limits all the memory wastes for a request within one block, so it can effectively utilize all the memory, as shown in Fig. 2. This allows more requests to fit into mem￾ory for batching—hence improving the throughput. Once a request finishes its generation, its KV blocks can be freed to store the KV cache of other requests. In Fig. 7, we show an example of vLLM managing the memory for two sequences. The logical blocks of the two sequences are mapped to differ￾ent physical blocks within the space reserved by the block engine in GPU workers. The neighboring logical blocks of both sequences do not need to be contiguous in physical GPU memory and the space of physical blocks can be effectively utilized by both sequences. 4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios §4.3 shows how PagedAttention and vLLM handle basic de￾coding algorithms, such as greedy decoding and sampling, that take one user prompt as input and generate a single out￾put sequence. In many successful LLM applications [18, 34], an LLM service must offer more complex decoding scenarios that exhibit complex accessing patterns and more opportuni￾ties for memory sharing. We show the general applicability of vLLM on them in this section. Parallel sampling. In LLM-based program assistants [6, 18], an LLM generates multiple sampled outputs for a single in￾put prompt; users can choose a favorite output from various candidates. So far we have implicitly assumed that a request generates a single sequence. In the remainder of this paper, we assume the more general case in which a request gener￾ates multiple sequences. In parallel sampling, one request includes multiple samples sharing the same input prompt, allowing the KV cache of the prompt to be shared as well. Via its PagedAttention and paged memory management, vLLM can realize this sharing easily and save memory. Fig. 8 shows an example of parallel decoding for two out￾puts. Since both outputs share the same prompt, we only reserve space for one copy of the prompt’s state at the prompt phase; the logical blocks for the prompts of both sequences are mapped to the same physical blocks: the logical block 0 and 1 of both sequences are mapped to physical blocks 7 and 1, respectively. Since a single physical block can be mapped to multiple logical blocks, we introduce a reference count for each physical block. In this case, the reference counts for physical blocks 7 and 1 are both 2. At the generation phase, the two outputs sample different output tokens and need separate storage for KV cache. vLLM implements a copy-on￾write mechanism at the block granularity for the physical blocks that need modification by multiple sequences, similar to the copy-on-write technique in OS virtual memory (e.g., when forking a process). Specifically, in Fig. 8, when sample A1 needs to write to its last logical block (logical block 1), vLLM recognizes that the reference count of the correspond￾ing physical block (physical block 1) is greater than 1; it allocates a new physical block (physical block 3), instructs the block engine to copy the information from physical block 1, and decreases the reference count to 1. Next, when sample A2 writes to physical block 1, the reference count is already reduced to 1; thus A2 directly writes its newly generated KV cache to physical block 1. In summary, vLLM enables the sharing of most of the space used to store the prompts’ KV cache across multiple output samples, with the exception of the final logical block, which is managed by a copy-on-write mechanism. By sharing physical blocks across multiple samples, memory usage can be greatly reduced, especially for long input prompts. Beam search. In LLM tasks like machine translation [59], the users expect the top-𝑘 most appropriate translations out￾put by the LLM. Beam search [49] is widely used to decode the most probable output sequence from an LLM, as it miti￾gates the computational complexity of fully traversing the sample space. The algorithm relies on the beam width pa￾rameter 𝑘, which determines the number of top candidates retained at every step. During decoding, beam search ex￾pands each candidate sequence in the beam by considering all possible tokens, computes their respective probabilities us￾ing the LLM, and retains the top-𝑘 most probable sequences out of 𝑘 · |𝑉 | candidates, where |𝑉 | is the vocabulary size. Unlike parallel decoding, beam search facilities sharing not only the initial prompt blocks but also other blocks across different candidates, and the sharing patterns dynamically change as the decoding process advances, similar to the pro￾cess tree in the OS created by compound forks. Fig. 9 shows how vLLM manages the KV blocks for a beam search ex￾ample with 𝑘 = 4. Prior to the iteration illustrated as the dotted line, each candidate sequence has used 4 full logi￾cal blocks. All beam candidates share the first block 0 (i.e., prompt). Candidate 3 digresses from others from the second block. Candidates 0-2 share the first 3 blocks and diverge at the fourth block. At subsequent iterations, the top-4 prob￾able candidates all originate from candidates 1 and 2. As the original candidates 0 and 3 are no longer among the top candidates, their logical blocks are freed, and the refer￾ence counts of corresponding physical blocks are reduced. vLLM frees all physical blocks whose reference counts reach 0 (blocks 2, 4, 5, 8). Then, vLLM allocates new physical blocks (blocks 9-12) to store the new KV cache from the new can￾didates. Now, all candidates share blocks 0, 1, 3; candidates 0 and 1 share block 6, and candidates 2 and 3 further share block 7. Previous LLM serving systems require frequent memory copies of the KV cache across the beam candidates. For exam￾ple, in the case shown in Fig. 9, after the dotted line, candidate 3 would need to copy a large portion of candidate 2’s KV cache to continue generation. This frequent memory copy overhead is significantly reduced by vLLM’s physical block sharing. In vLLM, most blocks of different beam candidates can be shared. The copy-on-write mechanism is applied only when the newly generated tokens are within an old shared block, as in parallel decoding. This involves only copying one block of data. Shared prefix. Commonly, the LLM user provides a (long) description of the task including instructions and example inputs and outputs, also known as system prompt [36]. The description is concatenated with the actual task input to form the prompt of the request. The LLM generates outputs based on the full prompt. Fig. 10 shows an example. Moreover, the shared prefix can be further tuned, via prompt engineering, to improve the accuracy of the downstream tasks [26, 27]. For this type of application, many user prompts share a prefix, thus the LLM service provider can store the KV cache of the prefix in advance to reduce the redundant computa￾tion spent on the prefix. In vLLM, this can be conveniently achieved by reserving a set of physical blocks for a set of predefined shared prefixes by the LLM service provider, as how OS handles shared library across processes. A user in￾put prompt with the shared prefix can simply map its logi￾cal blocks to the cached physical blocks (with the last block marked copy-on-write). The prompt phase computation only needs to execute on the user’s task input. Mixed decoding methods. The decoding methods dis￾cussed earlier exhibit diverse memory sharing and access￾ing patterns. Nonetheless, vLLM facilitates the simultane￾ous processing of requests with different decoding prefer￾ences, which existing systems cannot efficiently do. This is because vLLM conceals the complex memory sharing be￾tween different sequences via a common mapping layer that translates logical blocks to physical blocks. The LLM and its execution kernel only see a list of physical block IDs for each sequence and do not need to handle sharing pat￾terns across sequences. Compared to existing systems, this approach broadens the batching opportunities for requests with different sampling requirements, ultimately increasing the system’s overall throughput. 4.5 Scheduling and Preemption When the request traffic surpasses the system’s capacity, vLLM must prioritize a subset of requests. In vLLM, we adopt the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling policy for all requests, ensuring fairness and preventing starvation. When vLLM needs to preempt requests, it ensures that the earliest arrived requests are served first and the latest requests are preempted first. LLM services face a unique challenge: the input prompts for an LLM can vary significantly in length, and the resulting output lengths are not known a priori, contingent on both the input prompt and the model. As the number of requests and their outputs grow, vLLM can run out of the GPU’s phys￾ical blocks to store the newly generated KV cache. There are two classic questions that vLLM needs to answer in this context: (1) Which blocks should it evict? (2) How to recover evicted blocks if needed again? Typically, eviction policies use heuristics to predict which block will be accessed fur￾thest in the future and evict that block. Since in our case we know that all blocks of a sequence are accessed together, we implement an all-or-nothing eviction policy, i.e., either evict all or none of the blocks of a sequence. Furthermore, multi￾ple sequences within one request (e.g., beam candidates in one beam search request) are gang-scheduled as a sequence group. The sequences within one sequence group are always preempted or rescheduled together due to potential memory sharing across those sequences. To answer the second ques￾tion of how to recover an evicted block, we consider two techniques: Swapping. This is the classic technique used by most virtual memory implementations which copy the evicted pages to a swap space on the disk. In our case, we copy evicted blocks to the CPU memory. As shown in Fig. 4, besides the GPU block allocator, vLLM includes a CPU block allocator to manage the physical blocks swapped to CPU RAM. When vLLM exhausts free physical blocks for new tokens, it selects a set of sequences to evict and transfer their KV cache to the CPU. Once it preempts a sequence and evicts its blocks, vLLM stops accepting new requests until all preempted sequences are completed. Once a request completes, its blocks are freed from memory, and the blocks of a preempted sequence are brought back in to continue the processing of that sequence. Note that with this design, the number of blocks swapped to the CPU RAM never exceeds the number of total physical blocks in the GPU RAM, so the swap space on the CPU RAM is bounded by the GPU memory allocated for the KV cache. Recomputation. In this case, we simply recompute the KV cache when the preempted sequences are rescheduled. Note that recomputation latency can be significantly lower than the original latency, as the tokens generated at decoding can be concatenated with the original user prompt as a new prompt—their KV cache at all positions can be generated in one prompt phase iteration. The performances of swapping and recomputation depend on the bandwidth between CPU RAM and GPU memory and the computation power of the GPU. We examine the speeds of swapping and recomputation in §7.3. 4.6 Distributed Execution Many LLMs have parameter sizes exceeding the capacity of a single GPU [5, 9]. Therefore, it is necessary to partition them across distributed GPUs and execute them in a model parallel fashion [28, 63]. This calls for a memory manager capable of handling distributed memory. vLLM is effective in distributed settings by supporting the widely used Megatron-LM style tensor model parallelism strategy on Transformers [47]. This strategy adheres to an SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) execution schedule, wherein the linear layers are partitioned to perform block-wise matrix multiplication, and the the GPUs constantly synchronize intermediate results via an all￾reduce operation. Specifically, the attention operator is split on the attention head dimension, each SPMD process takes care of a subset of attention heads in multi-head attention. We observe that even with model parallel execution, each model shard still processes the same set of input tokens, thus requiring the KV Cache for the same positions. Therefore, vLLM features a single KV cache manager within the cen￾tralized scheduler, as in Fig. 4. Different GPU workers share the manager, as well as the mapping from logical blocks to physical blocks. This common mapping allows GPU workers to execute the model with the physical blocks provided by the scheduler for each input request. Although each GPU worker has the same physical block IDs, a worker only stores a portion of the KV cache for its corresponding attention heads. In each step, the scheduler first prepares the message with input token IDs for each request in the batch, as well as the block table for each request. Next, the scheduler broadcasts this control message to the GPU workers. Then, the GPU workers start to execute the model with the input token IDs. In the attention layers, the GPU workers read the KV cache according to the block table in the control message. During execution, the GPU workers synchronize the intermediate results with the all-reduce communication primitive without the coordination of the scheduler, as in [47]. In the end, the GPU workers send the sampled tokens of this iteration back to the scheduler. In summary, GPU workers do not need to synchronize on memory management as they only need to receive all the memory management information at the beginning of each decoding iteration along with the step inputs.","completion":"# 4 Method This section elaborates on a novel approach devised to address the memory management challenges in Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems, through an innovative attention algorithm called PagedAttention and a serving engine named vLLM. 4.1 PagedAttention PagedAttention reimagines traditional attention mechanisms by allowing for non-contiguous memory storage of keys and values, inspired by paging systems in operating systems. It segments the KV cache into blocks that can be stored and fetched separately, paving the way for more efficient memory management without demanding continuity in physical memory space. 4.2 KV Cache Manager The vLLM leverages a centralized KV cache manager that draws on principles from virtual memory management in operating systems. It dynamically maps logical to physical blocks within the GPU's memory, significantly enhancing memory utilization by obviating the need for preemptive memory reservation for the entire KV cache. 4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM This subsection illustrates how vLLM, through PagedAttention, optimizes memory usage during the decoding process. vLLM strategically allocates memory for new tokens as required, significantly reducing memory wastage. Physical KV blocks are repurposed dynamically, allowing for efficient management of the decoding process across iterations. 4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios vLLM's versatility extends to various decoding strategies like parallel sampling, beam search, and handling of shared prefixes. Its memory management prowess, enabled by PagedAttention, facilitates significant memory savings and improved efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving shared prompt components or complex decoding algorithms. 4.5 Scheduling and Preemption vLLM introduces a scheduling framework that ensures efficient execution prioritization. In scenarios where GPU memory is exceeded, vLLM employs strategies like swapping (to CPU memory) or recomputation to manage overloaded memory demands, enabling effective continuation of processing and optimizing system throughput. 4.6 Distributed Execution The vLLM system architecture is adept at distributed operations, accommodating LLMs whose parameters exceed single GPU capacities. By utilizing a model parallelism strategy and maintaining a global KV cache management system, vLLM ensures coordinated execution across distributed GPU units, allowing each unit to access and process a portion of the necessary KV cache. # Summary The vLLM system, propelled by the PagedAttention algorithm, presents a significant advancement in addressing memory management and scheduling challenges in LLM services. Through innovative memory management strategies and efficient handling of various decoding scenarios, vLLM optimizes GPU utilization, enhances system throughput, and provides a scalable solution for serving complex LLMs in distributed computing environments."},{"prompt":"5 Implementation vLLM is an end-to-end serving system with a FastAPI [15] frontend and a GPU-based inference engine. The frontend extends the OpenAI API [34] interface, allowing users to customize sampling parameters for each request, such as the maximum sequence length and the beam width 𝑘. The vLLM engine is written in 8.5K lines of Python and 2K lines of C++/CUDA code. We develop control-related components in￾cluding the scheduler and the block manager in Python while developing custom CUDA kernels for key operations such as PagedAttention. For the model executor, we implement pop￾ular LLMs such as GPT [5], OPT [62], and LLaMA [52] using PyTorch [39] and Transformers [58]. We use NCCL [32] for tensor communication across the distributed GPU workers. 5.1 Kernel-level Optimization Since PagedAttention introduces memory access patterns that are not efficiently supported by existing systems, we develop several GPU kernels for optimizing it. (1) Fused re￾shape and block write. In every Transformer layer, the new KV cache are split into blocks, reshaped to a memory layout optimized for block read, then saved at positions specified by the block table. To minimize kernel launch overheads, we fuse them into a single kernel. (2) Fusing block read and atten￾tion. We adapt the attention kernel in FasterTransformer [31] to read KV cache according to the block table and perform attention operations on the fly. To ensure coalesced memory access, we assign a GPU warp to read each block. More￾over, we add support for variable sequence lengths within a request batch. (3) Fused block copy. Block copy operations, issued by the copy-on-write mechanism, may operate on discontinuous blocks. This can lead to numerous invocations of small data movements if we use the cudaMemcpyAsync API. To mitigate the overhead, we implement a kernel that batches the copy operations for different blocks into a single kernel launch. 5.2 Supporting Various Decoding Algorithms vLLM implements various decoding algorithms using three key methods: fork, append, and free. The fork method creates a new sequence from an existing one. The append method appends a new token to the sequence. Finally, the free method deletes the sequence. For instance, in paral￾lel sampling, vLLM creates multiple output sequences from the single input sequence using the fork method. It then adds new tokens to these sequences in every iteration with append, and deletes sequences that meet a stopping condi￾tion using free. The same strategy is also applied in beam search and prefix sharing by vLLM. We believe future decod￾ing algorithms can also be supported by combining these methods.","completion":"# 5 Implementation The vLLM system is designed as a full-stack serving solution equipped with a FastAPI frontend for user interactions and a sophisticated GPU-based backend for inference processing. The system, adaptable to various user-defined parameters, is empowered by a unique blend of programming languages and technologies tailored for optimal performance and flexibility. 5.1 Kernel-level Optimization To address the unique challenges posed by the PagedAttention algorithm, particularly its unconventional memory access patterns, the vLLM team undertook significant development of custom GPU kernels, focusing on three critical areas: 1. **Fused Reshape and Block Write**: This optimization streamlines the process of distributing the newly computed Key-Value (KV) cache into memory blocks, ensuring an efficient layout for subsequent reads. By combining multiple operations into a single kernel, the system minimizes the overhead typically associated with launching multiple discrete GPU tasks. 2. **Fusing Block Read and Attention**: Borrowing from the advancements in the FasterTransformer project, the customized attention kernel is designed to dynamically read from the KV cache based on the current block table mapping. This approach not only simplifies the attention computation but also ensures that memory access is streamlined, reducing fragmentation and access latencies. 3. **Fused Block Copy**: Given the necessity of copying data blocks in scenarios like \\"copy-on-write,\\" the vLLM implementers recognized that handling discontinuous blocks could lead to performance bottlenecks. Therefore, a specialized kernel was developed to consolidate these operations, significantly reducing the overhead associated with small, scattered data movements. 5.2 Supporting Various Decoding Algorithms Flexibility in decoding is one of the cornerstones of the vLLM system. To cater to a wide range of applications, from parallel sampling to beam search and shared prefix utilization, vLLM leverages three fundamental operations: - **Fork**: This operation is designed to clone an existing sequence, creating a new branch for independent processing. This is especially useful in scenarios where a single input may lead to multiple potential outputs, such as in parallel sampling or exploring different branches in a beam search. - **Append**: Central to the iterative nature of language model decoding, the append function allows for the sequential addition of new tokens to an existing sequence. This continuous building enables the model to progressively generate output based on both the initial prompt and the tokens produced in preceding steps. - **Free**: To maintain efficiency and manage system resources, vLLM incorporates a mechanism to delete sequences that are either completed or terminated based on specific stopping conditions. This operation helps in freeing up valuable memory resources for new or ongoing computations. In summary, the vLLM implementation showcases a comprehensive approach to managing the intricacies of large language model serving, from optimized GPU kernel operations that address unique computing challenges to high-level functions supporting versatile decoding strategies. The adaptability and efficiency of vLLM affirm its potential to serve as a robust platform for various LLM applications, promising to accommodate future innovations in decoding algorithms through its modular design."},{"prompt":"6 Evaluation In this section, we evaluate the performance of vLLM under a variety of workloads. 6.1 Experimental Setup Model and server configurations. We use OPT [62] mod￾els with 13B, 66B, and 175B parameters and LLaMA [52] with 13B parameters for our evaluation. 13B and 66B are popular sizes for LLMs as shown in an LLM leaderboard [38], while 175B is the size of the famous GPT-3 [5] model. For all of our experiments, we use A2 instances with NVIDIA A100 GPUs on Google Cloud Platform. The detailed model sizes and server configurations are shown in Table 1. Workloads. We synthesize workloads based on ShareGPT [51] and Alpaca [50] datasets, which contain input and output texts of real LLM services. The ShareGPT dataset is a collec￾tion of user-shared conversations with ChatGPT [35]. The Alpaca dataset is an instruction dataset generated by GPT- 3.5 with self-instruct [57]. We tokenize the datasets and use their input and output lengths to synthesize client requests. As shown in Fig. 11, the ShareGPT dataset has 8.4× longer input prompts and 5.8× longer outputs on average than the Alpaca dataset, with higher variance. Since these datasets do not include timestamps, we generate request arrival times using Poisson distribution with different request rates. Baseline 1: FasterTransformer. FasterTransformer [31] is a distributed inference engine highly optimized for latency As FasterTransformer does not have its own scheduler, we implement a custom scheduler with a dynamic batching mechanism similar to the existing serving systems such as Triton [30]. Specifically, we set a maximum batch size 𝐵 as large as possible for each experiment, according to the GPU memory capacity. The scheduler takes up to 𝐵 number of earliest arrived requests and sends the batch to FasterTrans￾former for processing. Baseline 2: Orca. Orca [60] is a state-of-the-art LLM serving system optimized for throughput. Since Orca is not publicly available for use, we implement our own version of Orca. We assume Orca uses the buddy allocation algorithm to deter￾mine the memory address to store KV cache. We implement three versions of Orca based on how much it over-reserves the space for request outputs: • Orca (Oracle). We assume the system has the knowledge of the lengths of the outputs that will be actually generated for the requests. This shows the upper-bound performance of Orca, which is infeasible to achieve in practice. • Orca (Pow2). We assume the system over-reserves the space for outputs by at most 2×. For example, if the true output length is 25, it reserves 32 positions for outputs. • Orca (Max). We assume the system always reserves the space up to the maximum sequence length of the model, i.e., 2048 tokens. Key metrics. We focus on serving throughput. Specifically, using the workloads with different request rates, we mea￾sure normalized latency of the systems, the mean of every request’s end-to-end latency divided by its output length, as in Orca [60]. A high-throughput serving system should retain low normalized latency against high request rates. For most experiments, we evaluate the systems with 1-hour traces. As an exception, we use 15-minute traces for the OPT-175B model due to the cost limit. 6.2 Basic Sampling We evaluate the performance of vLLM with basic sampling (one sample per request) on three models and two datasets. The first row of Fig. 12 shows the results on the ShareGPT dataset. The curves illustrate that as the request rate in￾creases, the latency initially increases at a gradual pace but then suddenly explodes. This can be attributed to the fact that when the request rate surpasses the capacity of the serv￾ing system, the queue length continues to grow infinitely and so does the latency of the requests. On the ShareGPT dataset, vLLM can sustain 1.7×–2.7× higher request rates compared to Orca (Oracle) and 2.7×–8× compared to Orca (Max), while maintaining similar laten￾cies. This is because vLLM’s PagedAttention can efficiently manage the memory usage and thus enable batching more requests than Orca. For example, as shown in Fig. 13a, for OPT-13B vLLM processes 2.2× more requests at the same time than Orca (Oracle) and 4.3× more requests than Orca (Max). Compared to FasterTransformer, vLLM can sustain up to 22× higher request rates, as FasterTransformer does not utilize a fine-grained scheduling mechanism and inefficiently manages the memory like Orca (Max). The second row of Fig. 12 and Fig. 13b shows the results on the Alpaca dataset, which follows a similar trend to the ShareGPT dataset. One exception is Fig. 12 (f), where vLLM’s advantage over Orca (Oracle) and Orca (Pow2) is less pro￾nounced. This is because the model and server configuration for OPT-175B (Table 1) allows for large GPU memory space available to store KV cache, while the Alpaca dataset has short sequences. In this setup, Orca (Oracle) and Orca (Pow2) can also batch a large number of requests despite the inef￾ficiencies in their memory management. As a result, the performance of the systems becomes compute-bound rather than memory-bound. 6.3 Parallel Sampling and Beam Search We evaluate the effectiveness of memory sharing in Page￾dAttention with two popular sampling methods: parallel sampling and beam search. In parallel sampling, all paral￾lel sequences in a request can share the KV cache for the prompt. As shown in the first row of Fig. 14, with a larger number of sequences to sample, vLLM brings more improve￾ment over the Orca baselines. Similarly, the second row of Fig. 14 shows the results for beam search with different beam widths. Since beam search allows for more sharing, vLLM demonstrates even greater performance benefits. The im￾provement of vLLM over Orca (Oracle) on OPT-13B and the Alpaca dataset goes from 1.3× in basic sampling to 2.3× in beam search with a width of 6. Fig. 15 plots the amount of memory saving, computed by the number of blocks we saved by sharing divided by the number of total blocks without sharing. We show 6.1% - 9.8% memory saving on parallel sampling and 37.6% - 55.2% on beam search. In the same experiments with the ShareGPT dataset, we saw 16.2% - 30.5% memory saving on parallel sampling and 44.3% - 66.3% on beam search. 6.4 Shared prefix We explore the effectiveness of vLLM for the case a prefix is shared among different input prompts, as illustrated in 6.5 Chatbot A chatbot [8, 19, 35] is one of the most important applications of LLMs. To implement a chatbot, we let the model generate a response by concatenating the chatting history and the last user query into a prompt. We synthesize the chatting history and user query using the ShareGPT dataset. Due to the limited context length of the OPT-13B model, we cut the prompt to the last 1024 tokens and let the model generate at most 1024 tokens. We do not store the KV cache between different conversation rounds as doing this would occupy the space for other requests between the conversation rounds. Fig. 17 shows that vLLM can sustain 2× higher request rates compared to the three Orca baselines. Since the ShareGPT dataset contains many long conversations, the input prompts for most requests have 1024 tokens. Due to the buddy allo￾cation algorithm, the Orca baselines reserve the space for 1024 tokens for the request outputs, regardless of how they predict the output lengths. For this reason, the three Orca baselines behave similarly. In contrast, vLLM can effectively handle the long prompts, as PagedAttention resolves the problem of memory fragmentation and reservation. 7 Ablation Studies In this section, we study various aspects of vLLM and evalu￾ate the design choices we make with ablation experiments. 7.1 Kernel Microbenchmark The dynamic block mapping in PagedAttention affects the performance of the GPU operations involving the stored KV cache, i.e., block read/writes and attention. Compared to the existing systems, our GPU kernels (§5) involve extra over￾heads of accessing the block table, executing extra branches, and handling variable sequence lengths. As shown in Fig. 18a, this leads to 20–26% higher attention kernel latency, com￾pared to the highly-optimized FasterTransformer implemen￾tation. We believe the overhead is small as it only affects the attention operator but not the other operators in the model, such as Linear. Despite the overhead, PagedAttention makes vLLM significantly outperform FasterTransformer in end-to-end performance (§6). 7.2 Impact of Block Size The choice of block size can have a substantial impact on the performance of vLLM. If the block size is too small, vLLM may not fully utilize the GPU’s parallelism for reading and processing KV cache. If the block size is too large, inter￾nal fragmentation increases and the probability of sharing decreases. In Fig. 18b, we evaluate the performance of vLLM with dif￾ferent block sizes, using the ShareGPT and Alpaca traces with basic sampling under fixed request rates. In the ShareGPT trace, block sizes from 16 to 128 lead to the best performance. In the Alpaca trace, while the block size 16 and 32 work well, larger block sizes significantly degrade the performance since the sequences become shorter than the block sizes. In practice, we find that the block size 16 is large enough to efficiently utilize the GPU and small enough to avoid signifi￾cant internal fragmentation in most workloads. Accordingly, vLLM sets its default block size as 16. 7.3 Comparing Recomputation and Swapping vLLM supports both recomputation and swapping as its re￾covery mechanisms. To understand the tradeoffs between the two methods, we evaluate their end-to-end performance and microbenchmark their overheads, as presented in Fig. 19. Our results reveal that swapping incurs excessive overhead with small block sizes. This is because small block sizes often result in numerous small data transfers between CPU and GPU, which limits the effective PCIe bandwidth. In contrast, the overhead of recomputation remains constant across dif￾ferent block sizes, as recomputation does not utilize the KV blocks. Thus, recomputation is more efficient when the block size is small, while swapping is more efficient when the block size is large, though recomputation overhead is never higher than 20% of swapping’s latency. For medium block sizes from 16 to 64, the two methods exhibit comparable end-to-end performance.","completion":"# 6 Evaluation The evaluation assesses vLLM's performance across various workloads, comparing it with existing systems like FasterTransformer and a self-implemented version of Orca. Experiments were conducted using LLMs of different sizes and datasets reflecting realistic LLM service interactions. 6.1 Experimental Setup - **Models and Server Configurations**: Utilized OPT models (13B, 66B, 175B parameters) and LLaMA (13B parameters), reflecting popular and large LLM sizes. Experiments were executed on Google Cloud Platform's NVIDIA A100 GPUs. - **Workloads**: Derived from user-shared conversations (ShareGPT dataset) and instructions generated by GPT-3.5 (Alpaca dataset), representing realistic service demands with varying input and output lengths. Baseline Comparisons - **FasterTransformer**: A distributed inference engine optimized for latency but lacks a fine-grained scheduling mechanism and memory-efficient operations. - **Orca**: An LLM serving system optimized for throughput, with the study implementing versions differing in memory reservation for outputs (Oracle, Pow2, Max). Key Metrics - Focused on serving throughput by measuring normalized latency against different request rates over typically 1-hour traces. 6.2 Basic Sampling - vLLM significantly outperforms Orca and FasterTransformer, handling 1.7×–2.7× higher request rates than Orca (Oracle) and up to 22× higher than FasterTransformer on the ShareGPT dataset. - Demonstrates superior memory management efficiency, enabling better batching of requests. 6.3 Parallel Sampling and Beam Search - The memory-sharing capabilities of PagedAttention provide substantial benefits, especially evident in beam search scenarios, with vLLM showing up to 2.3× improvement over Orca (Oracle) in throughput. - Memory savings of 6.1% - 55.2% were observed due to efficient sharing mechanisms, significantly benefiting parallel sampling and beam search tasks. 6.4 Shared Prefix - Explored the advantage of vLLM in handling shared prefixes in input prompts, showcasing its ability to efficiently manage memory and optimize throughput for such scenarios. 6.5 Chatbot - vLLM demonstrated a 2× higher request rate capacity versus Orca baselines in handling chatbot applications, leveraging its memory optimization capabilities to manage long conversations effectively. # 7 Ablation Studies 7.1 Kernel Microbenchmark - PagedAttention's dynamic block mapping introduces a 20–26% attention kernel latency increase versus FasterTransformer but is justified by significant overall performance gains in vLLM. 7.2 Impact of Block Size - Optimal block sizes were identified between 16 to 128, balancing GPU utilization and minimizing internal fragmentation. Block size 16 emerged as a well-rounded default for most workloads. 7.3 Comparing Recomputation and Swapping - Evaluated the trade-offs between recomputation and swapping as recovery mechanisms. Swapping showed excessive overhead for small block sizes, while recomputation maintained constant overhead, favoring smaller block sizes. For medium block sizes (16 to 64), both methods showed comparable performance. # Summary vLLM offers a revolutionary improvement in serving throughput and efficiency for LLM serving systems, outperforming established systems like FasterTransformer and Orca across a range of scenarios. Through innovative memory management (PagedAttention) and optimized kernels, vLLM adapts to both basic and complex sampling demands, handling large workloads with significantly better efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of design choices in vLLM, underlining its superior capability to adapt to the diverse needs of LLM applications."},{"prompt":"please summarize \\"4.Method\\" again, and make sure each part get at least 100 words","completion":"# 4 Method The section describes the development of vLLM, an innovative Large Language Model (LLM) serving engine designed to address the challenges in memory management and throughput efficiency identified in earlier discussions. 4.1 PagedAttention PagedAttention revolutionizes the traditional attention mechanism by allowing keys and values in a Transformer model to be stored in non-contiguous memory segments. Drawing inspiration from the paging system used in operating systems, it introduces a method where the Key-Value (KV) cache is divided into smaller, manageable blocks. Each block stores a fixed number of token representations, facilitating more efficient memory utilization and minimizing waste. This blockwise approach alters the standard computation of attention scores, enabling the model to dynamically fetch necessary blocks based on the query's requirements. By adopting a structure where attention computation is treated as a blockwise operation, PagedAttention ensures that despite the physical discontinuity of data in memory, the logical flow of attention remains intact. This novel mechanism significantly enhances memory management flexibility and scalability in processing large language models. 4.2 KV Cache Manager The KV Cache Manager is pivotal to vLLM's architecture, employing strategies akin to those in virtual memory systems to efficiently manage the LLM's memory demands. It adopts a virtualization approach, where logical KV blocks are allocated as sequences request them, mirroring how operating systems manage memory pages. This abstraction allows for the logical representation of sequences to grow dynamically without the need to reserve extensive physical memory upfront, significantly reducing wasted memory space. Physical KV blocks on the GPU are mapped to these logical counterparts, ensuring that only necessary data is loaded into memory. This system cleverly addresses the challenge of fitting dynamic, variable-sized LLM requests into the fixed capacity of GPU memory, enabling higher throughput by minimizing the memory overhead traditionally associated with handling large models and requests. 4.3 Decoding with PagedAttention and vLLM This part delves into the operational intricacies of how vLLM leverages PagedAttention within its architecture for the decoding process. It describes a step-by-step approach, starting from the initial memory reservation for the input prompt through the dynamic allocation process for newly generated tokens. The example provided illustrates the process, highlighting how logical KV blocks are efficiently utilized and mapped to physical blocks in memory, only as needed. By employing a system that does not preemptively reserve space for the maximum possible sequence length, vLLM vastly reduces memory waste. The system can add more requests to a batch for processing by keeping memory utilization lean and focused on only the required data. This segment underscores the efficiency gains in throughput and memory utilization achieved through vLLM's innovative decoding mechanism, setting a new standard in LLM processing. 4.4 Application to Other Decoding Scenarios The flexibility of vLLM is further evidenced by its capability to adapt to various decoding scenarios, including parallel sampling and beam search, which are common in LLM applications. This section elaborates on how vLLM's foundational mechanisms—fork, append, and free—facilitate a wide range of decoding strategies. By enabling sequences to share memory space efficiently, especially for common prefixes or during beam search processes, vLLM significantly reduces the overall memory footprint. This sharing mechanism not only enhances computational efficiency but also opens up possibilities for more complex and memory-intensive decoding algorithms to be executed on existing hardware, underscoring vLLM's adaptability and forward-thinking design. 4.5 Scheduling and Preemption Addressing high request volumes and efficient system utilization, this part of the method section outlines vLLM's approach to scheduling and preemption. Faced with the challenge of varying request sizes and uncertain output lengths, vLLM adopts strategies akin to operating system memory management, such as dynamic allocation and priority-based task handling. The system prioritizes completing in-progress tasks while ensuring that resources are judiciously allocated among competing requests. Techniques such as swapping and recomputation are analyzed for their effectiveness in maintaining high throughput under load, indicating a sophisticated level of resource management that optimizes for both performance and fairness across requests. 4.6 Distributed Execution As the demand for processing power exceeds what single GPU configurations can offer, vLLM's design extends to distributed systems, ensuring scalability across multiple GPUs. This section details how vLLM accommodates models with immense parameter counts through a model parallelism approach, effectively distributing computation without sacrificing the efficiency gains achieved through PagedAttention and KV cache management. By incorporating strategies from established distributed computation frameworks and optimizing for the unique demands of large-scale LLMs, vLLM demonstrates an effective method for harnessing distributed resources, ensuring that even the most demanding LLMs can be served efficiently across multiple GPUs. # Summary The method section of the paper introduces a comprehensive and innovative approach to addressing the significant challenges of serving Large Language Models efficiently. Through a series of interconnected systems and algorithms, including PagedAttention, a novel KV Cache Manager, and sophisticated scheduling and execution strategies, vLLM represents a significant leap forward in LLM serving technology. Each component of the method is designed not only to optimize resource use but also to ensure scalability and adaptability to a range of decoding needs and computational environments."},{"prompt":"Write a parents guide for a non-existent movie with the following plot: В маленькой уединенной деревне, расположенной на границе двух враждующих государств, живет Эдди, мечтающий о больших приключениях и возможности стать героем.

However, I can certainly guide you on how to describe a diagram based on the common elements found in the External Interface sections of documents. This should help you articulate your description or understand what might be represented in the diagram of section 3.1. Typical Elements in External Interface Diagrams: System Boundary: This is usually depicted as a large box that encompasses the entire system or software being described. It separates the internal components and processes from the external entities and systems. External Systems and Entities: These are depicted as labeled boxes or symbols outside the system boundary. They represent other systems, users, or entities that interact with the subject system. For instance, if it’s a payment processing system, external entities could include banks, payment gateways, and end-users. Interfaces: These are usually represented by lines or arrows that connect the external systems and entities to the system boundary or specific components within it. Each interface might be labeled with the type of interaction (e.g., data exchange, API call, user input) or the nature of information being transferred (e.g., transaction details, authentication tokens). Labels and Annotations: Descriptive text provides additional details about each component, such as technologies used (e.g., REST API, Bluetooth), the direction of data flow (indicated with arrowheads), and the nature of the data or signals exchanged (e.g., JSON, XML). Data Flow: Particularly important in external interface diagrams, data flow can be illustrated with arrows between external entities and the system or among different external entities. It gives an overview of how data moves and is processed across system boundaries. Describing the Diagram Without Seeing It: When attempting to describe a diagram from section 3.1 External Interface without seeing it, focus on identifying and explaining the following aspects based on your understanding of the context and the document: What is the main purpose of the interface? (E.g., Data exchange, user interaction, system control) Who or what are the primary external entities or systems interacting with the system? (E.g., Users, external databases, third-party services) How do these entities interact with the system? (Through APIs, manual input, automated data feeds) What type of data or signals are exchanged? (User data, control signals, feedback) Are there any particular protocols, technologies, or standards mentioned? (HTTP, Bluetooth, ISO standards) What does the data flow indicate about the system’s operation and external dependencies? To analyze or describe specific diagrams accurately, familiarity with the system's context and the purpose of the external interfaces is crucial. If you have details about the system or specific elements of the diagram you are curious about, feel free to share, and I'll do my best to provide a relevant explanation or guidance.","completion":"오해가 있었다면 사과드립니다. 하지만 2023년 4월의 마지막 업데이트 기준으로 저는 특정 파일에 직접 접근하거나 이를 확인할 수 없습니다. 이는 업로드된 콘텐츠를 포함합니다. 그러나, 문서의 외부 인터페이스 섹션에서 흔히 발견되는 기본 요소를 바탕으로 다이어그램을 설명하는 방법에 대해 안내할 수는 있습니다. 이는 섹션 3.1의 다이어그램이 나타낼 수 있는 것을 이해하거나 설명하는 데 도움이 될 것입니다. 외부 인터페이스 다이어그램의 전형적 요소: 시스템 경계: 이는 대개 설명되고 있는 전체 시스템이나 소프트웨어를 둘러싼 큰 상자로 나타나며, 내부 구성 요소와 프로세스를 외부의 개체 및 시스템과 분리합니다. 외부 시스템 및 개체: 시스템 경계 외부에 라벨이 붙은 박스나 상징으로 나타납니다. 이들은 대상 시스템과 상호 작용하는 다른 시스템, 사용자 또는 개체를 나타냅니다. 예를 들어, 결제 처리 시스템이라면 외부 개체로는 은행, 결제 게이트웨이, 최종 사용자 등이 포함될 수 있습니다. 인터페이스: 이들은 보통 외부 시스템 및 개체와 시스템 경계 또는 그 내부의 특정 구성 요소를 연결하는 선 또는 화살표로 표현됩니다. 각 인터페이스는 상호 작용 유형(예: 데이터 교환, API 호출, 사용자 입력) 또는 전송되는 정보의 성격(예: 거래 세부 정보, 인증 토큰)에 따라 라벨이 붙을 수 있습니다. 라벨 및 주석: 설명 텍스트는 사용된 기술(예: REST API, 블루투스), 데이터 흐름 방향(화살표 머리로 표시), 교환되는 데이터나 신호의 성격(예: JSON, XML) 등 각 구성 요소에 대한 추가 세부 사항을 제공합니다. 데이터 흐름: 외부 인터페이스 다이어그램에서 특히 중요한 데이터 흐름은, 외부 개체와 시스템 사이 또는 여러 외부 개체간에 데이터가 어떻게 이동하고 처리되는지에 대한 개요를 화살표로 보여줄 수 있습니다. 다이어그램을 보지 않고 설명하기: 섹션 3.1 외부 인터페이스의 다이어그램을 보지 않고 설명을 시도할 때, 문서의 맥락과 외부 인터페이스의 목적을 바탕으로 다음과 같은 측면을 식별하고 설명에 집중하세요: 인터페이스의 주요 목적은 무엇인가요?

Tools Beta Give Assistants access to OpenAI-hosted tools like Code Interpreter and Knowledge Retrieval, or build your own tools using Function calling. Usage of OpenAI-hosted tools comes at an additional fee — visit our help center article to learn more about how these tools are priced. The Assistants API is in beta and we are actively working on adding more functionality. Share your feedback in our Developer Forum! Code Interpreter Code Interpreter allows the Assistants API to write and run Python code in a sandboxed execution environment. This tool can process files with diverse data and formatting, and generate files with data and images of graphs. Code Interpreter allows your Assistant to run code iteratively to solve challenging code and math problems. When your Assistant writes code that fails to run, it can iterate on this code by attempting to run different code until the code execution succeeds. Code Interpreter is charged at 0.03 per session. If your Assistant calls Code Interpreter simultaneously in two different threads (e.g., one thread per end-user), two Code Interpreter sessions are created. Each session is active by default for one hour, which means that you only pay for one session per if users interact with Code Interpreter in the same thread for up to one hour. Enabling Code Interpreter Pass the code_interpreterin the tools parameter of the Assistant object to enable Code Interpreter: python python assistant = client.beta.assistants.create( instructions=\\"You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.\\", model=\\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\\", tools=[{\\"type\\": \\"code_interpreter\\"}] ) The model then decides when to invoke Code Interpreter in a Run based on the nature of the user request. This behavior can be promoted by prompting in the Assistant's instructions (e.g., “write code to solve this problem”). Passing files to Code Interpreter Code Interpreter can parse data from files. This is useful when you want to provide a large volume of data to the Assistant or allow your users to upload their own files for analysis. Note that files uploaded for Code Interpreter are not indexed for retrieval. See the Knowledge Retrieval section below for more details on indexing files for retrieval. Files that are passed at the Assistant level are accessible by all Runs with this Assistant: python python # Upload a file with an \\"assistants\\" purpose file = client.files.create( file=open(\\"speech.py\\", \\"rb\\"), purpose='assistants' ) # Create an assistant using the file ID assistant = client.beta.assistants.create( instructions=\\"You are a personal math tutor. When asked a math question, write and run code to answer the question.\\", model=\\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\\", tools=[{\\"type\\": \\"code_interpreter\\"}], file_ids=[file.id] ) You do not pay for files attached to an Assistant or Message when used with Code Interpreter. You are only charged for files that are indexed for retrieval which happens automatically if the Retrieval tool is enabled. Files can also be passed at the Thread level. These files are only accessible in the specific Thread. Upload the File using the File upload endpoint and then pass the File ID as part of the Message creation request: python python thread = client.beta.threads.create( messages=[ { \\"role\\": \\"user\\", \\"content\\": \\"I need to solve the equation \`3x + 11 = 14\`. Can you help me?\\", \\"file_ids\\": [file.id] } ] ) Files have a maximum size of 512 MB. Code Interpreter supports a variety of file formats including .csv, .pdf, .json and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below. Reading images and files generated by Code Interpreter Code Interpreter in the API also outputs files, such as generating image diagrams, CSVs, and PDFs. There are two types of files that are generated: Images Data files (e.g. a csv file with data generated by the Assistant) When Code Interpreter generates an image, you can look up and download this file in the file_id field of the Assistant Message response: { \\"id\\": \\"msg_abc123\\", \\"object\\": \\"thread.message\\", \\"created_at\\": 1698964262, \\"thread_id\\": \\"thread_abc123\\", \\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"image_file\\", \\"image_file\\": { \\"file_id\\": \\"file-abc123\\" } } ] # ... } The file content can then be downloaded by passing the file ID to the Files API: python python from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI() image_data = client.files.content(\\"file-abc123\\") image_data_bytes = image_data.read() with open(\\"./my-image.png\\", \\"wb\\") as file: file.write(image_data_bytes) When Code Interpreter references a file path (e.g., ”Download this csv file”), file paths are listed as annotations. You can convert these annotations into links to download the file: { \\"id\\": \\"msg_abc123\\", \\"object\\": \\"thread.message\\", \\"created_at\\": 1699073585, \\"thread_id\\": \\"thread_abc123\\", \\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"text\\", \\"text\\": { \\"value\\": \\"The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file. You can download the shuffled CSV file from the following link:nn[Download Shuffled CSV File](sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv)\\", \\"annotations\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"file_path\\", \\"text\\": \\"sandbox:/mnt/data/shuffled_file.csv\\", \\"start_index\\": 167, \\"end_index\\": 202, \\"file_path\\": { \\"file_id\\": \\"file-abc123\\" } } ... Input and output logs of Code Interpreter By listing the steps of a Run that called Code Interpreter, you can inspect the code input and outputs logs of Code Interpreter: python python run_steps = client.beta.threads.runs.steps.list( thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id ) { \\"object\\": \\"list\\", \\"data\\": [ { \\"id\\": \\"step_abc123\\", \\"object\\": \\"thread.run.step\\", \\"type\\": \\"tool_calls\\", \\"run_id\\": \\"run_abc123\\", \\"thread_id\\": \\"thread_abc123\\", \\"status\\": \\"completed\\", \\"step_details\\": { \\"type\\": \\"tool_calls\\", \\"tool_calls\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"code\\", \\"code\\": { \\"input\\": \\"# Calculating 2 + 2nresult = 2 + 2nresult\\", \\"outputs\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"logs\\", \\"logs\\": \\"4\\" } ... } Knowledge Retrieval Retrieval augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users. Once a file is uploaded and passed to the Assistant, OpenAI will automatically chunk your documents, index and store the embeddings, and implement vector search to retrieve relevant content to answer user queries. Enabling Retrieval Pass the retrieval in the tools parameter of the Assistant to enable Retrieval: python python assistant = client.beta.assistants.create( instructions=\\"You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.\\", model=\\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\\", tools=[{\\"type\\": \\"retrieval\\"}] ) If you enable retrieval for a specific Assistant, all the files attached will be automatically indexed and you will be charged the 0.20/GB per assistant per day. You can enabled/disable retrieval by using the Modify Assistant endpoint. How it works The model then decides when to retrieve content based on the user Messages. The Assistants API automatically chooses between two retrieval techniques: it either passes the file content in the prompt for short documents, or performs a vector search for longer documents Retrieval currently optimizes for quality by adding all relevant content to the context of model calls. We plan to introduce other retrieval strategies to enable developers to choose a different tradeoff between retrieval quality and model usage cost. Uploading files for retrieval Similar to Code Interpreter, files can be passed at the Assistant-level or individual Message-level. python python # Upload a file with an \\"assistants\\" purpose file = client.files.create( file=open(\\"knowledge.pdf\\", \\"rb\\"), purpose='assistants' ) # Add the file to the assistant assistant = client.beta.assistants.create( instructions=\\"You are a customer support chatbot. Use your knowledge base to best respond to customer queries.\\", model=\\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\\", tools=[{\\"type\\": \\"retrieval\\"}], file_ids=[file.id] ) When a file is attached at the Message-level, it is only accessible within the specific Thread the Message is attached to. After having uploaded a file, you can pass the ID of this File when creating the Message. Note that you are not charged based on the size of the files you upload via the Files API but rather based on which files you attach to a specific Assistant or Message that get indexed. python python message = client.beta.threads.messages.create( thread_id=thread.id, role=\\"user\\", content=\\"I can not find in the PDF manual how to turn off this device.\\", file_ids=[file.id] ) The maximum file size is 512 MB and no more than 2,000,000 tokens (computed automatically when you attach a file). Retrieval supports a variety of file formats including .pdf, .md, .docx and many more. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below. Retrieval pricing Retrieval is priced at 0.20/GB per assistant per day. Attaching a single file ID to multiple assistants will incur the per assistant per day charge when the retrieval tool is enabled. For example, if you attach the same 1 GB file to two different Assistants with the retrieval tool enabled (e.g., customer-facing Assistant #1 and internal employee Assistant #2), you’ll be charged twice for this storage fee (2 * 0.20 per day). This fee does not vary with the number of end users and threads retrieving knowledge from a given assistant. In addition, files attached to messages are charged on a per-assistant basis if the messages are part of a run where the retrieval tool is enabled. For example, running an assistant with retrieval enabled on a thread with 10 messages each with 1 unique file (10 total unique files) will incur a per-GB per-day charge on all 10 files (in addition to any files attached to the assistant itself). Deleting files To remove a file from the assistant, you can detach the file from the assistant: python python file_deletion_status = client.beta.assistants.files.delete( assistant_id=assistant.id, file_id=file.id ) Detaching the file from the assistant removes the file from the retrieval index and means you will no longer be charged for the storage of the indexed file. File citations When Code Interpreter outputs file paths in a Message, you can convert them to corresponding file downloads using the annotations field. See the Annotations section for an example of how to do this. { \\"id\\": \\"msg_abc123\\", \\"object\\": \\"thread.message\\", \\"created_at\\": 1699073585, \\"thread_id\\": \\"thread_abc123\\", \\"role\\": \\"assistant\\", \\"content\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"text\\", \\"text\\": { \\"value\\": \\"The rows of the CSV file have been shuffled and saved to a new CSV file.

Function calling allows you to describe functions to the Assistants and have it intelligently return the functions that need to be called along with their arguments. The Assistants API will pause execution during a Run when it invokes functions, and you can supply the results of the function call back to continue the Run execution. Defining functions First, define your functions when creating an Assistant: python python assistant = client.beta.assistants.create( instructions=\\"You are a weather bot. Use the provided functions to answer questions.\\", model=\\"gpt-4-turbo-preview\\", tools=[{ \\"type\\": \\"function\\", \\"function\\": { \\"name\\": \\"getCurrentWeather\\", \\"description\\": \\"Get the weather in location\\", \\"parameters\\": { \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"location\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA\\"}, \\"unit\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"enum\\": [\\"c\\", \\"f\\"]} }, \\"required\\": [\\"location\\"] } } }, { \\"type\\": \\"function\\", \\"function\\": { \\"name\\": \\"getNickname\\", \\"description\\": \\"Get the nickname of a city\\", \\"parameters\\": { \\"type\\": \\"object\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"location\\": {\\"type\\": \\"string\\", \\"description\\": \\"The city and state e.g. San Francisco, CA\\"}, }, \\"required\\": [\\"location\\"] } } }] ) Reading the functions called by the Assistant When you initiate a Run with a user Message that triggers the function, the Run will enter a pending status. After it processes, the run will enter a requires_action state which you can verify by retrieving the Run. The model can provide multiple functions to call at once using parallel function calling: { \\"id\\": \\"run_abc123\\", \\"object\\": \\"thread.run\\", \\"assistant_id\\": \\"asst_abc123\\", \\"thread_id\\": \\"thread_abc123\\", \\"status\\": \\"requires_action\\", \\"required_action\\": { \\"type\\": \\"submit_tool_outputs\\", \\"submit_tool_outputs\\": { \\"tool_calls\\": [ { \\"id\\": \\"call_abc123\\", \\"type\\": \\"function\\", \\"function\\": { \\"name\\": \\"getCurrentWeather\\", \\"arguments\\": \\"{\\"location\\":\\"San Francisco\\"}\\" } }, { \\"id\\": \\"call_abc456\\", \\"type\\": \\"function\\", \\"function\\": { \\"name\\": \\"getNickname\\", \\"arguments\\": \\"{\\"location\\":\\"Los Angeles\\"}\\" } } ] } }, ... Submitting functions outputs You can then complete the Run by submitting the tool output from the function(s) you call. Pass the tool_call_id referenced in the required_action object above to match output to each function call. python python run = client.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs( thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id, tool_outputs=[ { \\"tool_call_id\\": call_ids[0], \\"output\\": \\"22C\\", }, { \\"tool_call_id\\": call_ids[1], \\"output\\": \\"LA\\", }, ] ) After submitting outputs, the run will enter the queued state before it continues it’s execution.

Lucas, que era inseguro em sua adolescência, está impressionado com a determinação de Bianca e decide incentivá-la a continuar treinando. A história se passa principalmente em casa, onde Bianca treina em um saco de pancadas improvisado.","completion":"O verão estava no auge quando Lucas pôs os pés em casa depois de um longo semestre de trabalho árduo na faculdade. Ele estava ancioso para relaxar, passar um tempo com a família e, acima de tudo, dormir em sua própria cama. Lucas, com seus 22 anos, carregava o peso de se tornar alguém importante, alimentado tanto pelos seus sonhos quanto pelas expectativas de seus pais. Durante sua adolescência, ele lidou com inseguranças que moldaram a pessoa que ele se tornou - alguém que valoriza a força de caráter acima de tudo. Nada, entretanto, o preparou para a surpresa que encontrou ao chegar em casa. Bianca, sua irmã de apenas 9 anos, estava no quintal, vestida com roupas esportivas improvisadas, golpeando com determinação um saco de pancadas que parecia tão improvisado quanto seu equipamento. O saco, preso por uma corda robusta a um galho resistente da velha árvore no quintal, balançava a cada golpe, testemunhando o inesperado. Intrigado e um tanto divertido, Lucas aproximou-se, observando a cena. Bianca, absorta em sua concentração, não notou sua presença imediatamente. Era uma visão fascinante - a menina esbelta, cuja fragilidade física sempre preocupou a família, exibia uma tenacidade surpreendente. \\"Bianca,\\" chamou Lucas, uma pontada de admiração na voz. Ela parou mid-punch, virando-se abruptamente, surpresa e talvez um pouco constrangida. \\"Lucas! Você voltou!\\" A excitação em sua voz era palpável, mas rapidamente deu lugar a uma expressão de determinação. \\"Estou treinando,\\" declarou, como se isso explicasse tudo. \\"Eu vejo,\\" Lucas respondeu, seu sorriso iluminando seu rosto. \\"Mas, boxe?\\" Bianca balançou a cabeça, cabelos presos em um rabo-de-cavalo balançando. \\"Sim! Quero ser forte. Não só por fora, mas por dentro também. Quero ser capaz de me proteger e não ter medo.\\" As palavras de Bianca ecoaram nos recantos da mente de Lucas, despertando sentimentos antigos de insegurança que ele havia enfrentado na adolescência. No entanto, a visão de sua irmã, enfrentando seus próprios medos e limitações com tanta coragem, acendeu uma chama de inspiração dentro dele. \\"Isso é incrível, Bianca.\\" Lucas deu um passo à frente, examinando o saco de pancadas improvisado. \\"Sabe, quando eu tinha sua idade, eu tinha minhas próprias inseguranças. Acho que nunca tive a sua coragem.\\" Bianca o olhou, uma mistura de surpresa e curiosidade em seus olhos. \\"Você, inseguro? Mas você é tão... você sabe, forte agora.\\" Lucas riu. \\"Nem sempre foi assim. Mas vejo que você tem algo que eu não tinha - determinação. E vou te ajudar.\\" O verão passou com Lucas e Bianca compartilhando momentos no quintal, sob a sombra da velha árvore. Lucas trouxe de volta da faculdade mais do que apenas livros e conhecimento - ele trouxe a experiência que adquiriu, as lições de vida que havia aprendido. Ele ensinou Bianca não apenas técnicas de boxe mais eficientes, como também a importância da disciplina, do respeito próprio e da perseverança. O saco de pancadas, que testemunhara as primeiras investidas solitárias de Bianca, agora era palco de uma jornada compartilhada. Mais que desenvolver músculos ou aprimorar habilidades no boxe, aquele verão tecia lições de vida, unindo irmão e irmã em uma jornada de autodescoberta. Bianca, com a orientação de Lucas, aprendia a canalizar sua determinação, entendendo que a verdadeira força vem de enfrentar os próprios medos. E Lucas, inspirado pela resiliência de sua irmã, reencontrava uma parte de si mesmo que pensava ter perdido - a vulnerabilidade que o tornava realmente forte. Naquele verão, sob o céu azul salpicado de nuvens e o sussurrar das folhas da velha árvore, Lucas e Bianca descobriram que, apesar das diferenças de idade e experiência, ambos tinham muito a ensinar um ao outro. E enquanto o saco de pancadas balançava suavemente ao sabor da brisa, ecoava mais que os golpes; ecoava risadas, conversas e o som do crescimento conjunto. E assim, na simplicidade de seu quintal, ambos encontraram a verdadeira essência do que significa ser forte."},{"prompt":"قم بتحويل التالية الى اغنية مع تخيل الموسيقى: معكِ الحبُ ليس للحظة بل للأبدِ وفي كل يومٍ معكِ تُكتب للحب قصيدة جديدة أحبكِ، يا آية، بكل معاني الحب وأعلم أن في حبكِ لي حياةٌ جديدةٌ لم تُعش بعد.","completion":"(مقدمة موسيقية ناعمة ورومانسية بألحان الجيتار وأصوات الكمان التي تنسج معاً شعوراً بالدفء والقرب) (يبدأ الغناء بصوت دافئ وعاطفي) معكِ الحبُ يا حياتي، ليس للحظة بل للأبدِ في كل يومٍ مرّ، وفي كل ثانية بجانبك نَعِد معكِ الحُب قصيدة نرددها، في كل مساء وكل عيد أحبكِ، يا آية، في كل الأوقات، بكل معاني الحب نفيد (انتقال إلى الكورس بألحان مرتفعة ومشاعر متأججة) أحبكِ، يا آية، بحبٍ يتجدد كل يوم في حبكِ عمر جديد، في حُبك اكتمل الحُلم يا آية، في القلب لكِ أمنية، بأن نعيش العمر معًا وكل ثانية بعمري تكوني فيها، تصبح حياة كُلَّها نُعما (موسيقى متوسطة الوتيرة كجسر موسيقي يعبر عن التحول والأمل) في كل نظرة منكِ، بالحب أُبحر في سفينة وفي كل ابتسامة منكِ، اشعر بالحياة السرمدية اللينة في حبكِ أشعر بالحياة، يا آية الحب والجمال ومعكِ أريد أن أعيش كل لحظاتي، بكل معنى مثالي وخَيَّال (العودة إلى الكورس بحماس وتشبث بالأمل) أحبكِ، يا آية، بكل قلبي، بكل العشق المكين وأعلم أن حُبكِ لي، هو بداية عمر فريد لم يُرى من قبل ولم يَبِين نعم، في حبكِ أرى العمر، في عينيكِ أرى الأحلام تترى معكِ الحبُ ليس للحظة بل للأبدِ، وفي حبكِ العمر يبدأ ويتجددُ بها (ختام بألحان موسيقية هادئة تتلاشى تدريجيًا مع الأفق، تُظهِر الرضا والامتنان للحظات الحب الأبدية) --- تم تصور الكلمات وتحويلها لأغنية مع خلق تصور موسيقي يتماشى مع المعاني والعواطف المُعبر عنها في النص الأصلي."},{"prompt":"قم بتشكيل كل حرف من حروف الأغنية تشكيلا لغويا صحيحا وسليما وضبط كل لفظ","completion":"مُلاحظة: في القصائد والأغاني، قد يُفضل الشعراء وكُتاب الأغاني في بعض الأحيان تجنب التشكيل للحفاظ على عناصر الإيقاع والقافية. لكن بناءً على طلبك، سأقوم بتشكيل الأغنية التي صاغتها حسب القواعد اللغوية. --- (مُقَدِّمَةٌ موسِيقِيَّةٌ نَاعِمَةٌ وَرُومَانْسِيَّةٌ بِأَلْحَانِ الجِيتَارِ وَأَصْوَاتِ الكَمَانِ الَّتِي تَنْسِجُ مَعًا شُعُورًا بِالدِّفْءِ وَالقُرْبِ) (يَبْدَأُ الغِنَاءُ بِصَوْتٍ دَافِئٍ وَعَاطِفِيٍّ) مَعَكِ الحُبُّ يَا حَيَاتِي، لَيْسَ لِلْحَظَةِ بَلْ لِلْأَبَدِ فِي كُلِّ يَوْمٍ مَرَّ، وَفِي كُلِّ ثَانِيَةٍ بِجَانِبِكِ نَعِدُ مَعَكِ الحُبُّ قَصِيدَةٌ نُرَدِّدُهَا، فِي كُلِّ مَسَاءٍ وَكُلِّ عِيدِ أُحِبُّكِ، يَا آيَةَ، فِي كُلِّ الأَوْقَاتِ، بِكُلِّ مَعَانِي الحُبِّ نَفِيدُ (انْتِقَالٌ إِلَى الكُورُسِ بِأَلْحَانٍ مُرْتَفِعَةٍ وَمشَاعِرَ مُتَأَجِّجَةٍ) أُحِبُّكِ، يَا آيَةَ، بِحُبٍّ يَتَجَدَّدُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ فِي حُبِّكِ عُمْرٌ جَدِيدٌ، فِي حُبِّكِ اكْتَمَلَ الحُلْمُ يَا آيَةَ، فِي القَلْبِ لَكِ أُمْنِيَّةٌ، بِأَنْ نَعِيشَ العُمْرَ مَعًا وَكُلُّ ثَانِيَةٍ بِعُمْرِي تَكُونِينَ فِيهَا، تُصْبِحُ حَيَاةٌ كُلُّهَا نُعْمًا (مُوسِيقَى مُتَوَسِّطَةُ الوَتِيرَةِ كَجِسْرٍ مُوسِيقِيٍّ يَعْبُرُ عَنِ التَّحَوُّلِ وَالأَمَلِ) فِي كُلِّ نَظْرَةٍ مِنْكِ، بِالْحُبِّ أُبْحِرُ فِي سَفِينَةٍ وَفِي كُلِّ ابْتِسَامَةٍ مِنْكِ، أَشْعُرُ بِالْحَيَاةِ السَّرْمَدِيَّةِ اللَّيْنَةِ فِي حُبِّكِ أَشْعُرُ بِالْحَيَاةِ، يَا آيَةَ الحُبِّ وَالجَمَالِ وَمَعَكِ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَعِيشَ كُلَّ لَحَظَاتِي، بِكُلِّ مَعْنًى مَثَالِيٍّ وَخَيَّالِ (العَوْدَةُ إلَى الكُورُسِ بِحَمَاسٍ وَتَشَبُّثٍ بِالأَمَلِ) أُحِبُّكِ، يَا آيَةَ، بِكُلِّ قَلْبِي، بِكُلِّ العِشْقِ الْمَكِينِ وَأَعْلَمُ أَنَّ حُبَّكِ لِي، هُوَ بِدَايَةُ عُمْرٍ فَرِيدٍ لَمْ يُرَى مِنْ قَبْلٍ وَلَمْ يَبِينِ نَعَمْ، فِي حُبِّكِ أَرَى العُمْرَ، فِي عَيْنَيْكِ أَرَى الأَحْلَامَ تَتْرَى مَعَكِ الحُبُّ لَيْسَ لِلْحَظَةِ بَلْ لِلأَبَدِ، وَفِي حُبِّكِ العُمْرُ يَبْدَأُ وَيَتَجَدَّدُ بِهَا (خِتَامٌ بِأَلْحَانٍ مُوسِيقِيَّةٍ هَادِئَةٍ تَتَلاَشَى تَدْرِيجِيًّا مَعَ الأُفُقِ، تُظْهِرُ الرِّضَا وَالامْتِنَانَ لِلَحْظَاتِ الحُبِّ الأَبَدِيَّةِ)"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They were an odd pair, indeed — one lived for the thrill of the accidental mishap, while the other found amusement in the playful torment of, well, everything. One sunny, unsuspecting morning, Mr. Tackle awoke with a bumbling enthusiasm that could only spell disaster for the townsfolk. \\"Ah! What a splendid day to inadvertently tackle life's challenges... and perhaps a few unsuspecting citizens,\\" he chirped, putting on his shoes (on the wrong feet, of course) and literally tumbling out of the door. Meanwhile, Mr. Sadist was busy laying out his wardrobe for the day, picking between a shirt that said \\"Hugs? I prefer shrugs\\" and another that simply displayed a lemon with a wicked grin. \\"When life gives you lemons, squeeze them in someone's eyes,\\" he chuckled to himself, choosing the latter. They met in the town square, where Mr. Tackle greeted Mr. Sadist with such force that it sent both of them rolling like a pair of mismatched bowling balls into Mrs. Dainty's outdoor cake display. Emerging from the ruins of what once were exquisite pastries, Mr. Tackle exclaimed, \\"What a stroke of luck! I've always wanted to know what it's like to be a fruit tart!\\" \\"Oh, joy,\\" Mr. Sadist droned sarcastically, plucking a cherry from his hair. \\"I've always dreamed of wearing eau de buttercream frosting.\\" The duo's next misadventure led them to Drollsville's annual \\"Watch Your Step\\" marathon, a peculiar race where participants had to navigate a track littered with an assortment of amusing traps and obstacles. It was, in essence, a playground for Mr. Tackle's clumsiness and Mr. Sadist's peculiar sense of humor. \\"Look out for the banana peels!\\" shouted Mr. Tackle, only to slip on one himself, careening into a table of water cups that sent a tidal wave of refreshment over the runners. Mr. Sadist, seizing the opportunity, directed runners into the path of a giant, inflatable hammer, which promptly booped them into a pit filled with foam letters. \\"Spelling has never been more impactful!\\" he cackled, as participants emerged spelling 'HELP' with their newly acquired foam accessories. As the sun set over Drollsville, casting long shadows and painting the sky in hues of laughter (quite literally, the clouds were chuckling), Mr. Tackle and Mr. Sadist sat atop a hill, overlooking the chaos they'd wrought. \\"Ah, what a day,\\" sighed Mr. Tackle, accidentally rolling down the hill in his moment of reflection. \\"You know, I think I've developed a slight affection for your type of chaos,\\" said Mr. Sadist, plotting a way to roll Mr. Tackle back up without exerting much effort. And so, as the stars twinkled like the eyes of amused onlookers above, Drollsville rested, knowing full well that tomorrow would bring another round of hilariously painful adventures courtesy of Mr. Tackle and Mr. Sadist - the most extraordinarily mismatched duo it had ever seen. **The End…?** *Disclaimer: No pastry chefs were harmed in the making of this story.

She was a vibrant soul, with an insatiable need to punctuate every discussion, debate, and casual chat with her own trademark closing remarks. One bright, loquacious morning, Mr. Chatterbox decided to host a tea party – a gathering that was to become the most monumental battle of verbosity Gabblebrook had ever seen. The guest list was a who's who of talkative luminaries, including Mr. Gab, Mrs. Gossip, and, of course, Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word. The garden was festooned with streamers that seemed to bicker amongst themselves in the breeze, a fitting atmosphere for what was to come. As the guests arrived, pleasantries were exchanged with such rapidity that they seemed to collide mid-air, creating a cacophony of cordiality. As the afternoon progressed, spirited debates and discussions took center stage. Topics ranged from the best method of brewing tea – to which Mrs. Gossip vehemently declared, \\"Milk first, always!\\" only for Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word to counter with, \\"Absolutely not! Tea first, then milk, then a side of silence, darling!\\" But it was the Great Gabblebrook Pie Debate that really set things off. Mr. Gab proposed, \\"Apple pies are the quintessence of pastry perfection!\\" No sooner had he finished than Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word interjected, \\"Pfft, apple is basic. Blueberry pies reign supreme, and that’s the final word on it!\\" This back-and-forth continued, with each guest attempting to outdo the others in proclamations and pontifications, but Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word lived up to her name spectacularly, always ensuring her voice was the final echo in the conversational canyon. As twilight descended on Gabblebrook and the tea party drew to a close, Mr. Chatterbox attempted to express his heartfelt thanks to his guests for attending. \\"I really must insist –\\" he began, only for Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word to chime in, \\"Oh but the pleasure was all ours, and that’s that. Tea, talk, and tarts – what more could one ask for?\\" Exhausted from the verbal gymnastics, the guests went home, leaving Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word standing alone in the garden. With a satisfied smile and a final look at the setting sun, she whispered to herself, \\"And that, my friends, is truly the last word.\\" ...Or so she thought, until a cheeky parrot from a nearby tree squawked, \\"The last word!\\" Flabbergasted and finally outdone, Little Miss Always-Has-To-Have-The-Last-Freaking-Word could only laugh, realizing that sometimes, the last word didn't have to be hers after all. **The End…?** (No, seriously, that's the end.

La mayor velocidad del usuario de la Fuerza permitió al individuo percibir y reaccionar ante el mundo y las entidades que lo rodean en cámara lenta, permitiéndole esquivar ataques fácilmente y atacar más rápidamente con mayor precisión. La técnica fue utilizada comúnmente por muchos usuarios de la Fuerza a lo largo de la historia , incluidos los Jedi , los Sith y la orden Matukai , una organización de adeptos de la Fuerza que usaban el cuerpo físico para canalizar la Fuerza. Durante las Guerras Clon , muchos Jedi utilizaron esta habilidad con gran efecto en los campos de batalla. También se usaba comúnmente para aumentar la velocidad durante los duelos con sables de luz , así como en combates sin armas . Según el tomo de la Maestra Jedi Tionne Solusar sobre la Fuerza, había un inconveniente al usar este poder; El uso de la velocidad de la Fuerza tenía un efecto agotador en la energía y el metabolismo del usuario de la Fuerza y requería un período de recuperación más largo. ANUNCIO Descripción Usar la Fuerza para aumentar la velocidad era una habilidad común entre muchos usuarios de la Fuerza a lo largo de la historia, y muchos podían usar la Fuerza para aumentar la velocidad de sus músculos y ralentizar su percepción del mundo. La mayor velocidad del usuario de la Fuerza les permitió ver el mundo y las entidades que los rodeaban en cámara lenta, lo que les permitió esquivar ataques fácilmente y atacar más rápidamente con mayor precisión. [1] [13] Con suficiente habilidad en esta habilidad, uno podría correr en superficies verticales durante breves períodos de tiempo. [9] Según el tomo de Tionne Solusar sobre la Fuerza escrito en el momento de la Segunda Guerra Civil Galáctica , la velocidad de la Fuerza sólo se alcanzaría después de que un Jedi usara la Fuerza para sintonizar todo su cuerpo con sus reflejos intensificados. El poder podría usarse con tal velocidad que parecían simplemente desaparecer de su posición anterior. Si el usuario estaba en combate desarmado, podría usarlo para poner fin rápidamente a una escaramuza. Sin embargo, había un inconveniente al utilizar este poder; El uso de la velocidad de la Fuerza tenía un efecto agotador en la energía y el metabolismo del usuario de la Fuerza y requería un período de recuperación más largo. [14] Una habilidad central de la Fuerza, [9] la velocidad de la Fuerza cayó bajo el área de control de la Fuerza, [1] que fue el primer aspecto de la Fuerza enseñado a los Iniciados Jedi . [15] La velocidad de la fuerza fue denominada con diferentes nombres a lo largo de la historia, incluyendo ráfaga de velocidad, [1] carrera rápida, [2] carrera forzada, [3] sprint forzado, [4] velocidad aumentada, [5] carrera forzada, [6 ] Fuerza de rapidez, [7] y Surge. [8] Aplicaciones El estallido de velocidad que experimenté no fue una casualidad, pero a diferencia de otros poderes de la Fuerza, no puedo decir que sentí que lo controlaba por completo. LUKE SKYWALKER REFLEXIONA SOBRE SU EXPERIENCIA CON LA VELOCIDAD DE LA FUERZA Tanto los Jedi como los Sith usaban comúnmente aumentar la velocidad de carrera mediante el uso de la Fuerza para aumentar los músculos , como cuando el Lord Sith Kaox Krul usó este poder de la Fuerza para perseguir a Crian Maru y Dree Vandap , que estaban en un deslizador. [11] En el 5.000 ABY , el Maestro Jedi Relin Druur usó el poder cuando atacó al Heraldo , que estaba extrayendo cristales de Lignan en el sistema Phaegon , y, según su propia estimación, fue capaz de cruzar 100 metros en un segundo, corriendo en una mancha. [dieciséis] Darth Sidious era un gran adepto de la fuerza-velocidad, usándola con precisión mortal durante su misión de matar al gran senador Pax Teem matando a un par de guardias Dugs a tal velocidad que parecía una mancha borrosa para los sentidos humanos y un fantasma para las cámaras de seguridad. . [17] Fuerza velocidad TPM Qui-Gon Jinn y Obi-Wan Kenobi usan la velocidad de la Fuerza para escapar de los droidekas . También se sabía que los Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn y Obi-Wan Kenobi eran expertos en esta habilidad, usándola para escapar de los droidekas de la Federación de Comercio . [18] Sin embargo, esta técnica no se limitó a los Jedi y Sith; Los Matukai que usaban la Fuerza y que se concentraban en canalizar la Fuerza a través de sus cuerpos, eran altamente capacitados para mantener movimientos basados en la agilidad usando la Fuerza. [12] Durante las Guerras Clon , muchos Jedi usaron esta habilidad con gran efecto en los campos de batalla, como se vio cuando el Maestro Jedi Mace Windu usó esta técnica para ganar impulso para un Salto de Fuerza de larga distancia que estaba a punto de realizar durante la Batalla de Dantooine , [19 ] así como para aumentar su capacidad de lucha contra Kar Vastor en Haruun Kal . [10] Los Jedi también podrían usar la Fuerza para aumentar sus músculos y aumentar la velocidad de sus movimientos durante el combate, aumentando sus reflejos y aumentando la velocidad de sus bloqueos y golpes durante los enfrentamientos. El Gran Maestro Luke Skywalker era competente en esta aplicación del poder, a menudo usando la Fuerza para aumentar la velocidad de sus golpes con sable de luz , [20] como se vio durante sus duelos con el Señor Supremo Yuuzhan Vong Shimrra Jamaane [21] y UnuThul . [22] Durante su duelo , el Maestro Jedi Mace Windu y el Señor Oscuro de los Sith Darth Sidious mostraron una habilidad considerable en esta habilidad, ambos moviéndose de forma borrosa. En particular, Vaapad, la forma del sable de luz de Mace Windu , dependía del uso de la Fuerza de esta manera, ya que en combate parecería como si estuviera empuñando docenas de espadas a la vez. [23] Sin embargo, el uso prolongado de la Fuerza para aumentar su velocidad podría dejar al usuario peligrosamente cansado. [4] Katarnspeed El Maestro Jedi Kyle Katarn usando la velocidad de la Fuerza. Ralentizar su percepción del mundo le daría a un usuario de la Fuerza más tiempo para reaccionar ante una situación como la que Luke Skywalker descubrió en el 3 DBY , durante su confrontación con la réplica humana del droide Guri en el Palacio del Príncipe Xizor en Coruscant . Con la guía de la voz de Ben Kenobi, Luke cedió a la Fuerza y descubrió que el tiempo parecía ralentizarse considerablemente, lo que le permitió esquivar el ataque del asesino y derrotarla con facilidad. [24] Luke más tarde comentaría a sus estudiantes en el Jedi Praxeum que no se sentía en control de este poder y en cambio sentía que era la Fuerza guiando sus acciones. [14] Usuarios Usuarios de la fuerza de la República Usar la Fuerza para aumentar la velocidad de movimiento fue una habilidad común entre muchos usuarios de la Fuerza a lo largo de la historia , particularmente entre Jedi como Johun Othone , [25] Obi-Wan Kenobi y Qui-Gon Jinn, [18] así como Sith como como Kaox Krul, [11] Darth Bane , [26] y Darth Maul . [27] [28] El Jedi Relin Druur recurría regularmente a la Fuerza para aumentar su velocidad, durante duelos y escaramuzas. Durante su pelea final, Druur y el Lord Sith Saes Rrogon se movieron a una velocidad que era borrosa incluso para los ojos de Druur. [16] Scourge , un Lord Sith en el reformado Imperio Sith , era capaz de aumentar su velocidad con la Fuerza, moviéndose a una velocidad cegadora mientras esquivaba un ataque de mercenarios en Dromund Kaas . [29] Durante la Gran Guerra Galáctica , la Caballero Jedi Aryn Leneer era una hábil usuaria de la velocidad de la Fuerza y pudo ralentizar su percepción del tiempo para poder cronometrar perfectamente un salto hiperespacial cuando intentaba infiltrarse en Coruscant después del asalto Sith al planeta. . También recurrió a la Fuerza para aumentar su velocidad durante los enfrentamientos. El Lord Sith Darth Malgus también era experto en aumentar su velocidad con la Fuerza y la usó durante muchas batallas, como el asalto Sith a Coruscant y su duelo con Leneer. [30] Las Guerras Clon y el surgimiento del Imperio reflejos jedi Qui-Gon Jinn usa la velocidad de la Fuerza para atrapar la lengua de Jar Jar Binks. Con los Jedi llamados a las armas en las Guerras Clon, muchos Jedi usarían esta habilidad durante las muchas batallas del conflicto para ayudar en el combate. Los generales Jedi Mace Windu, [10] [19] Obi-Wan Kenobi, [31] Anakin Skywalker , [32] y Aayla Secura , [28] eran conocidos por usar la Fuerza para mejorar su velocidad en la batalla. Ahsoka Tano , la padawan de Anakin Skywalker , también era capaz de utilizar esta técnica, usándola para dejar atrás al corredor Kidd Kareen en una carrera a pie a través de un puente en el planeta Mon Gazza . [33] Otro padawan, el Chiss Nuru Kungurama , era capaz de correr tan rápido que sus pies parecían apenas tocar el suelo cuando usaba esta habilidad. [34] El Maestro Jedi Kit Fisto mostró un alto nivel de habilidad en esta habilidad cuando se enfrentó a un droide asesino Jedi en Ord Cestus , moviéndose en un movimiento borroso que desconcertó incluso la mirada experimentada de Obi-Wan Kenobi. Más tarde utilizó esta técnica para esquivar el fuego del blaster y llegar a una familia de cuatro que estaba acorralada por uno de los droides . [35] La Maestra Jedi humana Taria Damsin usó el sprint de la Fuerza mientras defendía la ciudad de Torbel en Lanteeb de un escuadrón de droides de batalla. [36] También se sabía que la Jedi Oscura Asajj Ventress había usado esta habilidad mientras luchaba contra los otros gladiadores en el Caldero . [37] Los Maestros Jedi Roan Shryne , Bol Chatak y Padawan Olee Starstone también usaron la Fuerza para mejorar su velocidad y poner cierta distancia entre ellos y los soldados clon que los perseguían después de la ejecución de la Orden 66 . Shryne usaría más tarde esta habilidad para huir de Darth Vader durante el intento de rescatar al senador Fang Zar . [38] Después del surgimiento del Imperio Galáctico , otro usuario de la velocidad de la Fuerza fue el aprendiz Sith de Darth Vader, Galen Marek , quien usaría la Fuerza para cruzar rápidamente distancias cortas. [39] El Jedi Oscuro Thaum Rystra , también al servicio del Imperio, era capaz de mejorar su velocidad con la Fuerza. [40] El Jedi Rachi Sitra , que estaba en la lista de los más buscados del Emperador , [41] intentó usar velocidad mejorada por la Fuerza cuando se enfrentaba al cazarrecompensas Boba Fett sobre Dathomir; sin embargo, Fett pudo desarmarla con un cohete de muñeca y fue capturada. [42] Nueva Orden Jedi Fuerza Velocidad Luke Guri EGTF Luke Skywalker usando Fuerza y Velocidad Era una habilidad común entre los miembros de la Nueva Orden Jedi , y muchos empleaban la técnica, incluidos Mara Jade Skywalker , Anakin Solo , [43] Ulaha Kore , [44] Thann Mithric , Jaina Solo , [45] Tenel Ka , Leia Organa Solo. , [46] Tahiri Veila , [47] [48] Kam Solusar , [49] y Ben Skywalker . [50] El maestro de batalla Jedi Kyle Katarn se volvió competente en esta habilidad después de usarla por primera vez en Nar Shaddaa para escapar de los matones de 8t88 . [51] Más tarde utilizaría la técnica para acceder a la torre administrativa de Barons Hed . [51] Al regresar con los Jedi después de su ausencia, Katarn tuvo que usar esta habilidad en una prueba preparada por Luke Skywalker para recuperar su sable de luz . [52] Katarn luego le pasaría esta habilidad a su estudiante Jaden Korr , quien se volvió experto en su uso durante su entrenamiento en el Jedi Praxeum en Yavin 4 [9] y la usó para aumentar su velocidad durante un breve duelo con el antiguo Jedi Relin. Druur. [16] En el 11 DBY , bajo la influencia del antiguo Lord Sith Exar Kun , el aprendiz Jedi Kyp Durron usó la Fuerza para accionar los controles de la superarma Sun Crusher con velocidad Jedi para esquivar los rayos tractores del sistema de defensa Caridan , antes de usar el Sun Crusher para destruir el sistema Carida . [53] Carrera ráfaga Un Jedi Oscuro usando la velocidad de la Fuerza. El Jedi y más tarde el Lord Sith Jacen Solo también era un usuario hábil y frecuente de la técnica, a menudo usándola en situaciones peligrosas y en combate. [45] [46] [54] [55] Durante su primer duelo, Jaina Solo y Darth Caedus recurrieron a la Fuerza para intercambiar golpes ultrarrápidos. Jaina experimentó una poderosa conexión con la Fuerza, lo que le permitió moverse más rápido que nunca antes; creía que incluso podría atrapar un rayo láser entre sus dedos. [56] La Jedi caída Alema Rar también era una usuaria competente de esta técnica, siendo capaz de moverse a velocidades que superaban lo que su entrenamiento Jedi debería haberle permitido. [46] Otro usuario experto de esta técnica fue Valin Horn [46] quien usó esta técnica mientras estaba bajo la influencia de una locura de la Fuerza en un esfuerzo por escapar de su padre, Corran , a quien creía que era un impostor. Corran Horn también usó esta técnica para mantenerse al día con su hijo mientras intentaba hacer que Valin entrara en razón. Más tarde, después de que Valin Horn escapara de la custodia Jedi, Octa Ramis, miembro del Consejo de Maestros Jedi, utilizó una ráfaga de velocidad asistida por la Fuerza para ganar distancia y saltar para aterrizar en el clásico caza estelar Ala-X que Valin estaba usando para escapar. [57] Seff Hellin , que sufría de la misma locura relacionada con la Fuerza que Valin, también era capaz de usar esta técnica, [58] usándola para escapar de la persecución mientras intentaba rescatar a Valin del Centro Correccional Armand Isard . [57] Cuando Sothais Saar también sucumbió a la locura que plagaba al joven Jedi, mostró la capacidad de correr a una velocidad que lo hacía aparecer como una mancha de movimiento mientras escapaba del Edificio del Senado de la Alianza . [50] Entre bastidores En Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II , la velocidad cuando se activa aumenta la velocidad del objeto del juego. En Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast este no es el caso; el juego alrededor del jugador se ralentiza mientras que el del jugador permanece normal, lo que significa que la habilidad no solo aumentó su velocidad, sino que alteró la percepción del tiempo del Jedi. [52] [51] Kyle Katarn también apareció en el juego de computadora Star Wars: Empire at War , que se desarrolla varios meses antes de la Batalla de Yavin IV , antes de que Katarn descubriera que era sensible a la Fuerza. Sin embargo, en el juego una de sus habilidades especiales es la velocidad, que en realidad podría ser el uso no entrenado de la velocidad de la Fuerza. Esto está respaldado por el hecho de que la velocidad de la Fuerza fue el primer poder de la Fuerza que Katarn aprendió. Una explicación más mundana podría ser que es simplemente la misma habilidad de \\"sprint\\" que también poseen Han Solo y Chewbacca dentro del mismo juego. [59] En Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic y Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords , es posible que el jugador aprenda el poder Burst of Speed. Los juegos tienen diferentes niveles de habilidad para el poder, Knight Speed y Master Speed, que aumentan las estadísticas de defensa y ataque del jugador con el uso del poder. [60] [61] En el Libro de reglas básico revisado del juego de rol de Star Wars , también hay diferentes niveles del poder llamados Knight Speed y Master Speed que permiten al usuario moverse hasta veinte y treinta veces más rápido de lo normal, respectivamente. y también aumentar la distancia de salto del usuario.","completion":"La velocidad de la Fuerza era un poder de la Fuerza que permitía al usuario mantener velocidades de sprint durante un tiempo breve. Los usuarios avanzados podían lograr mayores aumentos de velocidad y/o mayor duración.

Era común entre Jedi, Sith y otros grupos a lo largo de la historia, útil tanto en combate como en situaciones de necesidad de movimientos rápidos. El uso de este poder agotaba la energía y el metabolismo del usuario, requiriendo un período de recuperación posterior. Ejemplos notables de uso incluyen a Jedi como Qui-Gon Jinn y Obi-Wan Kenobi, que lo utilizaron para escapar de droidekas, y a Sith como Darth Sidious, quien lo usó con efectividad letal. Durante las Guerras Clon, Jedi como Mace Windu lo emplearon con gran efecto. Este poder también permitía mejorar los reflejos y la velocidad de los ataques durante el combate. Además, algunos usuarios podían usar la Fuerza para correr en superficies verticales por breves periodos de tiempo. Luke Skywalker y otros Jedi de alto rango también reforzaron su habilidad en combate con esta técnica. Sin embargo, a pesar de su utilidad, el uso reiterado de la velocidad de la Fuerza podía dejar al usuario exhausto y requería manejo prudente para evitar el agotamiento."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a floor of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman sitting, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","completion":"\\"Passionate Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Artwork | Woman with Bouquet | Sparse Flower Backdrop | Versatile for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Passionate Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Artwork | Woman with Bouquet | Sparse Flower Backdrop | Versatile for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings.

His name? Mr. Unlucky. Mr. Unlucky lived in a house that looked like it had been designed by a committee of blindfolded elephants. The door was always jammed, the windows would either not open or close (mostly not close when it rained frogs, which was surprisingly often), and the chimney seemed to have a personal vendetta against him, belching smoke into the house every time he lit a fire. One bright, seemingly auspicious morning—which was peculiar in itself because mornings in Mr. Unlucky's life were typically clouded with misfortune—he decided to change his fate. Mr. Unlucky, wearing his only pair of shoes (one size too small, of course), stepped out. His trousers immediately caught on the doorknob, and with one swift, unlucky move, he was pants-less. Unperturbed, because, well, this was his life, he marched on in his polka-dotted boxers. His first stop? The Department of Fortunes, Fate, and Other Miscellanea. If anyone could turn his luck around, it was them. Presumably. Upon arriving, a sign hung crookedly: \\"Gone Fishin’, Be Back in 5… Maybe 10... Years.\\" Typical. Just his luck. He sighed so heavily that a nearby pigeon took pity on him, a remarkable event considering Mr. Unlucky’s history with birds. Not one to give up (because, honestly, when your baseline is rock-bottom, you've got nothing to lose), Mr. Unlucky sought out a legendary figure known only as Madame Fortuna, a mystical being said to live at the top of the conveniently named Mount Ominous. The trek was perilous. Along the way, he fell into a river, was chased by an overly enthusiastic squirrel, and inadvertently crashed a picnic, which actually went surprisingly well until he realized he had accidentally eaten a sandwich belonging to a family of bears. Yes, bears. Their picnic basket game was strong. Finally, after scaling cliffs and dodging falling rocks that seemed to have a personal agenda against him, Mr. Unlucky stood at the entrance of Madame Fortuna’s cave. The entrance sign read: \\"Knock thrice and ye shall receive thy destiny… or I might be in the bath, it’s really a fifty-fifty chance.\\" Mr. Unlucky knocked once, twice, thrice. The air shimmered, and there stood Madame Fortuna, wrapped in a bath towel, her hair wrapped in another, smaller towel. \\"You have sought me for fortune?\\" she boomed, bubbles from her bubble bath still clinging to her. In a voice that trembled, not from fear but from the slight chill in the air (his pants fate remained a mystery), Mr. Unlucky nodded. Madame Fortuna pondered, sipping from a cup of ominously steaming tea. \\"Your luck, dear sir, cannot be reversed. But!\\"—Mr. Unlucky’s heart sank—\\"it can be shared.\\" “Shared?” he echoed, puzzled. “Indeed! Your misfortune is so potent, so incredibly dense, that sharing it dilutes its effect. Spread it thin enough, and life will seem, dare I say, almost fortunate!” And so, Mr. Unlucky embarked on a new journey. He started by accidentally crashing weddings (where his mere presence ensured the bride and groom would cherish their union, having survived the disaster that was his attendance). He wandered into job interviews, where his bad luck was so absurd it made every other candidate look outstanding by comparison. In time, people sought out Mr. Unlucky, not to avoid him, but for a dash of his misfortune, believing a bit of bad luck from him could prevent larger calamities in their own lives. Mr. Unlucky, the man whose presence once made birds change flight paths, became a legend. He never did find his pants, but he found his purpose. And so, in a twist no one, least of all Mr. Unlucky, saw coming, Mr. Unlucky became Mr. Lucky-Enough. Because when you're as unlucky as he was, even a smidgeon of good fortune feels like winning the lottery. The end? For Mr. Unlucky, it was just another bizarre, improbable, and hilarious beginning."},{"prompt":"hi give the name of indian president","completion":"The current President of India is Ram Nath Kovind."},{"prompt":"Do you see a link between text (1) and text (2). Text(1) : if interventions on upper-level variables are impossible, given the levels assumption, it does not make sense to investigate the conditions under which the causal relations and the results of interventions on micro-level variables can be coherently mapped into interventions involving macro-models. If exclusionism is correct, there are no genuine macro-interventions to relate to micro-interventions and upper -level variables are always causally inert. Text (2): Anyone who has ever had the experience of holding back laughter in a serious or solemn context. In such situations, it seems that the conscious will is able to control and inhibit an automatic and spontaneous reaction - laughter - which would have been triggered by the situation if we had let it express itself. In other words, the causal efficacy of voluntary inhibition appears in a counterfactual way: if the subject hadn't held back, then he would have laughed out loud. This counterfactual expresses the actual causal efficacy of voluntary control on the non-initiation of laughter. This raises the question of the link between the automatic processes that underlie laughter and the intentional control that represses it. How do these two types of process interact to produce observable behavior? Can we propose a formal model to account for this interaction ? Suppose that by comparing the neurophysiological state of subjects just before they burst out laughing, we have identified a set of biological properties F_1,...,F_n positively correlated with the onset of laughter. These properties can be either binary (i.e. present or absent), or gradable (i.e. able to take on different values on a continuous scale, ex. the concentration level of a certain neurotransmitter). These properties are assumed to be mutually compatible (they can be instantiated simultaneously in the same subject) and independent. For any gradable property F_i, it is assumed that there is an optimal value o_i such that the probability of the subject laughing at the next instant is maximal when F_i=o_i, all other things being equal. If F_i is a binary property, o_i=1, since instantiating F_i increases the probability of laughter by hypothesis. We assume that the act of refraining from laughing is all the more difficult the closer the F_i properties are to their optimal o_i values. Now, let's suppose that at a given instant, a subject instantiates a configuration of F_i properties that is very favorably associated with laughter, but at the same instant, he intends not to laugh. Thus, if the strength with which the subject inhibits his laughter is quantified by a variable I taking its values between 0 and 1 (I=0 corresponding to an absence of inhibition and I=1 to maximum inhibition), we can assume that the value of I depends on the social context: it will be close to 1 in a serious context and close to 0 in a relaxed one. For the sake of model simplicity, we assume that the actual onset of laughter depends on the value of a binary variable R (if R=1 the subject laughs, 0 otherwise). It is assumed that voluntary inhibition I has a negative influence on R, while physiological properties F_i have a positive influence on R, the closer they are to their optimal values o_i. Scope of the model. This model makes it possible to account for variable aspects of the determination and inhibition of laughter: - The different factors likely to trigger laughter (humorous stimuli, tickling, laughing gas, etc.) can correspond to different F_i properties with different weights of influence on R. - The further the F_i properties are from their optimal o_i values, the less inclined to laugh and the easier it is to inhibit. - Borderline cases correspond to situations where positive stimulation (the combination of properties F_i) and voluntary inhibition (I) have approximately equal and opposite strengths. In other words, laughter is about to be triggered because positive stimulation slightly outweighs inhibition, or conversely, laughter is just about to be inhibited because voluntary inhibition slightly outweighs positive stimulation. Limits. The model takes F_1,...,F_n as the essential realizers of laughter, strictly separating them from I, the voluntary control variable, in that the two intervene in a parallel way on R. However, it is possible for the properties F_i and the variable I to interact directly.For example, certain laughter triggers such as laughing gas could affect not only F_i but also I, or I could act on F_i rather than just R. Moreover, although the term \\"voluntary control\\" is psychological in nature, there is nothing to prevent it from being entirely reducible to lower-level properties.","completion":"Both Text (1) and Text (2) navigate the complex terrain of understanding how different levels of phenomena (macro and micro, or conscious control and automatic processes) interact or potentially fail to interact. Despite the seemingly disparate topics—causal relations in scientific models in Text (1) and the interplay between automatic and conscious processes of laughter inhibition in Text (2)—a common thread can be identified in the investigation of how higher-level interventions or controls can influence or map onto lower-level phenomena. Text (1) challenges the perspective of effectively translating interventions from macro- to micro-level variables due to the assumption that higher-level (macro) variables are causally inert if exclusionism holds. This suggests a skepticism towards the efficacy of interventions at the macro-level having meaningful impacts on micro-level variables within the proposed framework. Text (2), conversely, immerses in the analysis of a specific human behavior—laughter—and how it can be voluntarily controlled despite being primarily driven by automatic processes (micro-level variables, in this analogy). It proposes a model where a higher-level, conscious control (analogous to a macro-level intervention) exerts influence over the probability of laughter, which is otherwise conditioned by a set of physiological properties (the micro-level variables). This model anticipates and allows for interactions between the macro-level intervention (I, or voluntary inhibition) and the micro-level automatic processes (F_i properties) influencing the behavior. The link between the two texts, then, lies in their exploration of the interface between levels of control or influence (macro and micro; voluntary inhibition and physiological properties), and particularly in how complex systems (whether they are scientific models or human behaviors) can be influenced or controlled by interventions at different levels. Both texts share an undercurrent of questioning and analyzing the feasibility and mechanism through which higher-level controls can influence lower-level processes, though arriving from distinct disciplinary perspectives. Moreover, both texts grapple with the possible limitations and complexities of modeling these interactions. Text (1) posits a skeptical view on the actionability of macro-level interventions due to exclusionism, questioning the direct causal influence of higher-level variables. Text (2), while more optimistic about the potential for interaction between levels of control, also acknowledges the intricacies and possible limits of its proposed model, including the direct interactions between different levels of variables (F_i and I). In summary, despite the domain-specific language and focus, both texts delve into the philosophical and practical challenges of understanding and modeling the interactions between different levels of phenomena, whether it be in causal relationships in scientific modeling or in the neuropsychology of behavior control."},{"prompt":"make link with: These researchers are looking for what might be described as a “compatibilist” (that is, non-exclusionist) solution to the relation between micro and macro-level interventions, according to which the two sets of interventions ft together in some appropriate way and interventions on upper-level variables are not impossible.","completion":"Integrating the \\"compatibilist\\" perspective into the discussion deepens the connection between Text (1) and Text (2), offering a richer framework to understand how the two explorations might intersect. A \\"compatibilist\\" solution, which argues against exclusionism, posits that interventions at both micro and macro levels can coexist harmoniously and influence one another. In this view, macro interventions are indeed possible and can have real, causal effects on micro-level phenomena without denying the causal power or autonomy of lower-level entities. In the context of Text (1), adopting a compatibilist view challenges the initial skepticism regarding the efficacy of macro-level interventions on micro-level variables. Instead, it suggests that upper-level (macro) variables can play a meaningful role in influencing systems, opening the door for richer models of causal relationships that accommodate the influence of both micro- and macro-level interventions. This perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of scientific modeling and intervention, where the causal efficacy of higher-level variables is recognized and incorporated into how we understand and intervene in complex systems. Text (2) can be seen as an empirical exploration of compatibilism in the domain of human behavior, particularly in the voluntary inhibition of laughter. Here, the \\"compatibilist\\" viewpoint is implicitly supported through the model that posits a coherent relationship between the physiological properties (micro-level) and voluntary inhibition (macro-level). The model suggests that not only can macro interventions (e.g., the decision not to laugh) influence the outcome of micro-level processes (the physiological conditions conducive to laughter), but that these two levels of description and intervention are fundamentally intertwined and influence the observable outcome in a cooperative manner. Further linking this to the \\"compatibilist\\" perspective highlighted, both texts can be seen as attempts to refute the mutual exclusivity of macro and micro interventions, instead advocating for a model where interventions at different levels integrate harmoniously to produce observable phenomena. This approach emphasizes the necessity of understanding both the parts and the whole, and how interventions at any level can contribute to the behavior of complex systems—be it in the context of scientific models or understanding mechanisms of human behavior like laughter. Therefore, the exploration of a \\"compatibilist\\" or non-exclusionist solution offers a framework that finds resonance in both texts, advocating for an integrative approach to understanding and modeling the interactions between different levels of phenomena, where interventions at both macro and micro levels are not only possible but essential for a holistic understanding of complex systems."},{"prompt":"I want you to write an introduction to text (2).

The assertion that \\"If exclusionism is correct, there are no genuine macro-interventions to relate to micro-interventions and upper-level variables are always causally inert\\" challenges researchers to rethink the dynamics of causal influence across different layers of analysis. Against this backdrop, our investigation ventures into the realm of laughter—a seemingly spontaneous and uncontrollable human response—and examines how it is subject to the intricate interplay between conscious control and automatic physiological processes. This enigmatic behavior serves as a case study to scrutinize the validity and applicability of exclusionism in the context of human psychology and neurophysiology. We delve into the question of whether volitional suppression, a macro-level intervention characterized by the conscious will to inhibit laughter, can effectively alter the course of micro-level physiological processes that predispose an individual to laughter. This inquiry not only challenges the notion of causal inertness attributed to upper-level variables but also paves the way for a nuanced understanding of how voluntary and automatic processes can coexist and interact within the human cognitive architecture. Through this lens, we aim to unravel the complexities underlying the balance of control and spontaneity in human behavior, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on the cross-level causation and the potential for compatibilism in psychological and neuroscientific paradigms."},{"prompt":"is the phrase \\"To the question \\"What is the causal efficacy of psychological properties?\\", some claim that they have none\\" a good starter? I'd love to know very specific books and articles (and if possible exact quotes) by philosophers of mind who hold this position. I want absolutely precise quotes.","completion":"The phrase you've proposed can indeed serve as a compelling opening to a discussion or paper examining the philosophical debates around the causal efficacy of psychological properties. It immediately sets the stage for exploring a contentious issue in the philosophy of mind: whether psychological states—thoughts, beliefs, emotions—can have real causal effects on physical states or behaviors. However, finding absolutely precise quotes requires accessing specific sources. Below are philosophers and works that engage with positions skeptical of the causal efficacy of psychological properties, directly or indirectly. I'll guide you toward where you might find relevant discussions, but for exact quotes, consulting the original texts is necessary. 1. **Jaegwon Kim** is a pivotal figure in discussions about mental causation, often arguing against non-reductive physicalism, which can imply skepticism towards the causal efficacy of distinct psychological properties. His work often focuses on the \\"exclusion argument,\\" which suggests that if physical causes fully account for physical effects, there seems no causal work left for the mental. **Reference Work:** Kim, Jaegwon. \\"Mind in a Physical World: An Essay on the Mind-Body Problem and Mental Causation.\\" MIT Press, 1998. 2. **Daniel Dennett** has argued extensively on the nature of consciousness and mental states from a functionalist perspective. While not denying the causal efficacy of psychological states outright, he emphasizes a level of description in which mental states are seen as having causal roles based on their functional properties rather than their intrinsic qualities. **Reference Work:** Dennett, Daniel. \\"The Intentional Stance.\\" MIT Press, 1987. 3. **Paul and Patricia Churchland** are known for their eliminative materialism, which argues that common-sense psychological concepts (folk psychology) are likely to be replaced by a more scientifically accurate understanding of the mind. This position implies skepticism about the causal efficacy of psychological properties as traditionally conceived. **Reference Work:** Churchland, Paul M. \\"Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes.\\" Journal of Philosophy, 78(2):67–90, 1981. 4. **David Armstrong** has offered influential accounts of the mind from a materialist standpoint, focusing on the idea that mental states are identical to physical states. His work supports the idea that mental states have causal powers, but precisely because they are nothing over and above physical states. **Reference Work:** Armstrong, D.M. \\"A Materialist Theory of the Mind.\\" Routledge, 1968. For exact quotes and to get into the nuances of each philosopher's arguments, you will need to consult the original texts. Each of these works contributes to the debate on the causal power of psychological states in a way that nuances or outright challenges the simplistic notion that psychological properties have no causal efficacy. Given the complexity of these positions, engaging directly with the texts is crucial for an accurate representation of their arguments."},{"prompt":"Cuales son las reglas de los jedi","completion":"La orden Jedi, proveniente del icónico universo de \\"Star Wars\\" creado por George Lucas, sigue un conjunto de principios y reglas diseñadas para mantener la paz y el orden en la galaxia, así como para cultivar la conexión de sus miembros con la Fuerza. Aunque las reglas pueden variar ligeramente en representación a lo largo de los diferentes medios que conforman este vasto universo, incluyendo películas, libros, series y videojuegos, hay ciertos preceptos fundamentales que definen a los Jedi. Estos incluyen tanto el Código Jedi como otras reglas de conducta: # El Código Jedi El Código Jedi es posiblemente la suma de todas las reglas de esta orden. Sirve como guía filosófica para los Jedi y ayuda a sus miembros a mantenerse del lado luminoso de la Fuerza. El Código es como sigue: 1. No hay emoción, hay paz. 2. No hay ignorancia, hay conocimiento. 3. No hay pasión, hay serenidad. 4. No hay caos, hay armonía. 5. No hay muerte, hay la Fuerza. # Otras reglas y preceptos clave Además del Código, los Jedi siguen una serie de principios y reglas adicionales, que aunque pueden no estar formalmente escritas en todos los contextos, son ampliamente reconocidas dentro del universo de Star Wars: 1. **No formar apegos personales:** Se les enseña a evitar apegos personales como el amor romántico y los lazos familiares, para prevenir que esas emociones los conduzcan hacia el Lado Oscuro. Sin embargo, se fomenta el amor en el sentido de una preocupación compasiva por los demás. 2. **Servir y proteger a la República:** Los Jedi sirven como guardianes de la paz y la justicia en la República Galáctica, comprometiéndose a actuar en defensa de sus ideales y sus ciudadanos. 3. **Rechazo a buscar poder personal:** Aunque los Jedi son a menudo figuras poderosas, se espera que utilicen sus habilidades para ayudar a otros y no para su propio beneficio o para acumular poder personal. 4. **Compromiso con el entrenamiento y la enseñanza:** Los Jedi deben dedicarse al aprendizaje continuo y, a su vez, están obligados a enseñar y formar a las próximas generaciones de Jedi, pasando sus conocimientos y sabiduría. 5. **Evitar el uso de la Fuerza para fines personales:** Se espera que los Jedi usen la Fuerza con responsabilidad y sólo en situaciones de necesidad, evitando recurrir a ella por ira, miedo o venganza. Este conjunto de reglas es lo que tradicionalmente ha distinguido a los Jedi del Lado Oscuro de la Fuerza, cuyos seguidores, como los Sith, abrazan las pasiones y el poder personal en contraposición a los valores Jedi de desinterés y moderación."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Specifically, this scattering loss is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength ((lambda)) of light. This relationship is expressed by the formula: [ L = frac{C}{lambda^4} ] where (L) is the scattering loss, (lambda) is the wavelength of the light, and (C) is a constant that depends on the composition and physical properties of the fiber material. Rayleigh scattering occurs because of the minute inhomogeneities in the material's refractive index, which cause some of the light to scatter in different directions. Since it is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength, as the wavelength increases, the scattering loss decreases. At a wavelength of 1.55 (mu m), which is in the infrared range, optical fibers exhibit relatively low scattering loss. That's because this value is significantly higher than the wavelength at which loss would be higher, for instance, in the visible spectrum ((0.4 - 0.7 mu m)). As a result, at 1.55 (mu m), the amount of loss due to Rayleigh scattering in a fiber is minimized, situating in the range of approximately 0.12 to 0.16 decibels per kilometer (dB/km). This specific range accounts for variations due to different types of fiber and manufacturing variations. This low loss at 1.55 (mu m) is one of the reasons why this wavelength is commonly chosen for long-distance optical communication systems. It allows for greater distances between signal amplification points, making it economically and technically advantageous."},{"prompt":"where c is the range 0.7 - 0.9 (dB/km) mm4","completion":"Given the context of Rayleigh scattering in optical fibers and the formula relating scattering loss ((L)) to the wavelength of the light ((lambda)), let's clarify how the constant (C) fits into our discussion, especially when its value is specified in the range 0.7 - 0.9 (dB/km)(cdot)mm(^4). Rayleigh scattering is described by the equation: [L = frac{C}{lambda^4}] Here, (L) represents the scattering loss in dB/km, (lambda) is the wavelength of the light in micrometers ((mu)m), and (C) is a constant that depends on the material properties of the optical fiber, including its refractive index and the density of inhomogeneities. The value of (C) also integrates the units to match those of (L), making (C) have a unit of (dB/km)(cdot)(mu)m(^4). Given the specification that (C) is in the range 0.7 - 0.9 (dB/km)(cdot)mm(^4), it's imperative to note that 1 mm = 1000 (mu)m, so when we speak in terms of (mu)m, the value of (C) needs to be converted accordingly: [C = 0.7text{ to }0.9, text{(dB/km)}cdot text{mm}^4 = (0.7text{ to }0.9) times (10^3)^4, text{(dB/km)}cdot mutext{m}^4] [C = 700000text{ to }900000, text{(dB/km)}cdot mutext{m}^4] Now, applying the given values at a wavelength of 1.55 (mu)m, we can estimate the scattering loss: [L = frac{C}{(1.55)^4}] Taking (C = 700000) as an example: [L_{text{min}} = frac{700000}{(1.55)^4} approx 0.119, text{dB/km}] And for (C = 900000): [L_{text{max}} = frac{900000}{(1.55)^4} approx 0.153, text{dB/km}] These calculations align closely with the suggested scattering loss range of 0.12 - 0.16 dB/km for light at a wavelength of 1.55 (mu)m. Small discrepancies in the final values can be attributed to rounding during calculations. Thus, when light at a 1.55 (mu)m wavelength propagates through an optical fiber, the loss due to Rayleigh scattering is relatively low, falling within this calculated range, making it an optimal choice for minimizing attenuation in fiber-optic communication systems."},{"prompt":"what is the diff in request body specifically with respect to fields has \\"bar\\" like

Creating a pentagram using HTML and CSS by aligning five independent triangles at 72-degree intervals can be a bit intricate because CSS does not directly support drawing triangles through a straightforward property. Instead, you can use the CSS border trick to create triangles and then rotate and position them to form a pentagram. Here is a simple way to achieve this by creating a container for the pentagram and then adding five divs, each representing a triangle. Each triangle is then rotated and positioned appropriately to form the pentagram. # HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram</title> <link rel=“stylesheet” href=“style.css”> </head> <body> <div class=“pentagram”> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 0deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 72deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 144deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 216deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 288deg;”></div> </div> </body> </html> # CSS (style.css) body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; background-color: #f0f0f0; } .pentagram { position: relative; width: 200px; height: 200px; } .triangle { --size: 90px; position: absolute; width: 0; height: 0; border-left: calc(var(–size) / 2) solid transparent; border-right: calc(var(–size) / 2) solid transparent; border-bottom: var(–size) solid black; /* Change color if needed / transform-origin: 50% 100%; transform: rotate(var(–rotation)) translateY(-35%); } This example shows how to create a pentagram by using pure HTML and CSS. Here’s how it works: 1. The .pentagram class forms a container for the entire shape. It’s sized and positioned to center the pentagram on the page. 2. Each .triangle represents one of the vertices of the pentagram. They’re created using the CSS trick of setting borders on an element with a 0 width and height. The borders are manipulated in such a way that they appear as triangles. 3. A custom property (–rotation) is used to rotate each triangle the correct amount. The triangles are rotated around their bottom point using transform-origin. 4. CSS variables make it easier to adjust the size and rotation of the triangles directly in the HTML code with the style attribute, allowing for a clear customization point. This example provides a basic pentagram. For more complex or stylized versions, further customization of sizes, colors, and positions may be required. not sure about 72. just do as need To achieve the correct alignment of each triangle to form a pentagram, we do indeed need to rotate each triangle by multiples of 72 degrees. This is because a pentagram is a five-pointed star, and a full circle (360 degrees) divided by five points gives us 72 degrees between each point. Given the initial instructions and the need to precisely align each triangle, the CSS provided in the previous example already sets up the correct rotation using multiples of 72 degrees for each triangle. This leads to the correct formation of a pentagram. However, it seems there was a desire for clarification or reassurance on the 72-degree rotation. Let’s break down why 72 degrees is the correct choice: - A pentagram consists of 5 triangles making up a star within a circle. - Circles have 360 degrees. - Dividing the circle by the 5 points of the star gives us 360/5 = 72 degrees. - Therefore, each triangle needs to be rotated by 72 degrees relative to the one before it to ensure they are evenly spaced in a pentagram shape. The CSS snippet provided earlier uses a custom CSS property --rotation utilized in inline styles for each .triangle div, effectively incrementing the rotation by 72 degrees for each triangle. This means the triangles are rotated by 0, 72, 144, 216, and 288 degrees respectively. If the concern is about alignment or appearance other than the 72-degree rotation, ensure that: - The transform-origin is correctly set to ensure triangles rotate around their correct center. - Adjustments in positioning (translateY) might be needed based on the size of the container and the triangles themselves to ensure a visually appealing alignment. - The browser supports CSS variables and the latest CSS features to ensure the look is rendered as intended. The combination of HTML and CSS provided should yield a correctly formed pentagram when viewed in a modern web browser. If any issues persist, it may be beneficial to experiment with the size (–size variable) and positioning (adjusting the translateY value in the .triangle class) to better fit your specific needs or desired appearance. because actual pentagram is kinda different of traditional five angled star. here’s perfect pentagram but not in independent five triangles: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Five_Pointed_Star_Lined.svg: <path fill=“none” stroke=“#000” stroke-width=“5” d=“m55,237 74-228 74,228L9,96h240z”/></svg> Creating a pentagram that closely resembles the traditional symbol, involving lines connecting the outer points through continuous paths rather than independent triangles, presents a different challenge. Based on the SVG link you provided, which outlines a perfect pentagram through a single path, you showed interest in replicating this in an SVG format rather than using HTML/CSS for individual triangles. If you aim to create this pentagram with the SVG format as provided, here is the direct implementation of the SVG you linked: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram</title> </head> <body> <!-- SVG code for a Pentagram --> <svg xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg” width=“260” height=“245”> <path fill=“none” stroke=“#000” stroke-width=“5” d=“m55,237 74-228 74,228L9,96h240z”/> </svg> </body> </html> This SVG code creates a pentagram in line with traditional symbolism, using a path element to define the star’s shape with a single continuous line. The attributes specify the path’s design: - fill=“none” ensures the inside of the pentagram is transparent. - stroke=“#000” defines the line color as black. - stroke-width=“5” sets the line thickness. - The d attribute outlines the path data, effectively drawing the pentagram shape. To achieve the same appearance using individual triangles (though the original request now seems more focused on the traditional line-drawn pentagram symbol), would require dividing the path into segments that represent each of the star’s outer triangles. This is more complex and doesn’t align with traditional pentagram representations, which emphasize the unbroken lines connecting the outer points. Using SVG, as shown, is the most straightforward and scalable way to include detailed and precise graphical elements, like a pentagram, in web content. It ensures that the symbol maintains its proportions and appearance across all devices and screen sizes, without the complications that could arise from trying to manually position HTML/CSS elements to achieve the same effect. no, gpt4, need five independent triangles in pentagram structure. here’s some more info regarding all kinds of pentagrams and shits: “”\\"Pentagram Page Discussion Read View source View history Tools Task Pentagram You are encouraged to solve this task according to the task description, using any language you may know.

Creating a pentagram made of five independent triangles in HTML and CSS that align correctly in a clockwise direction with each triangle at a 72-degree rotation can be quite complex due to the way CSS manages shapes and rotations. Given the constraints, this approach uses a combination of HTML and CSS to approximate the request as closely as possible. The fundamental hurdle is that when CSS creates triangles using the border trick, they essentially appear as arrows pointing up or down because the “triangle” is technically the transparent half of a square’s border. Thus, constructing a pentagram (a star with interconnected lines) from separate triangle elements in CSS will not replicate the traditional line-connected pentagram without overlaid elements or SVG for precise shapes. However, to follow the task as closely as permitted by CSS and HTML alone, you can arrange five divs (as triangles) in a circle and rotate each to simulate the pentagram’s star points. Note, this will not create the interconnected star lines seen in classic pentagrams but will position triangles in an approximation. # HTML <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram with Triangles</title> <link rel=“stylesheet” href=“style.css”> </head> <body> <div class=“pentagon”> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 0deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 72deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 144deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 216deg;”></div> <div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 288deg;”></div> </div> </body> </html> # CSS (style.css) body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; background-color: #f0f0f0; } .pentagon { position: relative; width: 200px; height: 200px; } .triangle { --size: 60px; position: absolute; bottom: 50%; left: 50%; width: 0; height: 0; margin-left: -var(–size)/2; margin-bottom: var(–size)/2.5; border-left: calc(var(–size)/2) solid transparent; border-right: calc(var(–size)/2) solid transparent; border-bottom: var(–size) solid black; /* Change color if needed */ transform-origin: 50% 80%; transform: rotate(var(–rotation)) translateY(-35%); } This approximation uses CSS custom properties for rotation and the CSS border trick to create the triangles. Each triangle is positioned at the center of the “.pentagon” div and then rotated around its transform-origin, which is adjusted to align the bases in a rough circular arrangement. Keep in mind, true geometric precision—like that seen in vector graphics or CAD software—cannot be achieved with this method due to the limitations of CSS rendering and the inherent design of HTML as a document layout system, not a graphic design tool. For intricate designs or ones requiring mathematical precision, SVG or canvas with JavaScript would be more suitable and accurate. Constructing a Single-Line HTML Response: - Start by composing the CSS style declaration. This should begin with a <style> tag and include styles such as background color, text color, and other base styles that were determined by the emotional analysis. - Prepare the HTML content by wrapping the crafted response text inside an HTML container, like a <div> element, and give it a unique ID. - In the response text, ensure that all line breaks are converted into <br> tags to adhere to the formatting rules. - Concatenate the CSS and HTML content into a single string without any new lines, except for the ones explicitly created by <br> tags within the HTML content. 6. Ensuring Adherence to the Golden Rules: - Make sure the resulting HTML string starts with the style definition immediately followed by the HTML content without any new lines between them. - Verify that no extra new lines are introduced in the output. - Follow a consistent ID naming strategy for the HTML container and its contents Given the instructions, I will construct a simple HTML response with integrated CSS styling that complies with the specified guidelines. This single-line HTML/CSS response will display the sentence “This is a simple, emotion-driven response.” on a soothing light blue background with white text. To meet the requirements, I’ll ensure the styles are directly embedded within the style tag, and the response is properly encapsulated in a div with a unique id. Here is how it can be done: <style>body{background-color:#add8e6;color:#ffffff;margin:0;padding:20px;font-family:sans-serif;}#emotionResponse{padding:10px;}</style><div id=“emotionResponse”>This is a simple,<br>emotion-driven response.</div> Breakdown: - The &lt;style&gt; tag includes basic styles: setting the body’s background color to light blue (#add8e6), the text color to white (#ffffff), removing default margins, adding padding for a bit of space, and setting a generic sans-serif font for better readability. - The content is wrapped in a &lt;div&gt; with an id of emotionResponse, ensuring a unique identifier is in place. - The text “This is a simple, emotion-driven response.” is enclosed within the div, and a &lt;br&gt; tag is used to represent a line break, adhering to the no-new-lines rule except where explicitly indicated. - Everything is concatenated into a single line to meet the requirements, with no extra new lines introduced in the output. This offers a streamlined approach to creating an HTML/CSS response that’s not only consistent with a set of established guidelines but also designed to be emotionally engaging through the use of colors and formatting adhering to basic design and usability principles. no, just output that pentagram html in one-lined string and from the very first line in response, without newlines. don’t describe anything or explain. <style>body{display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;min-height:100vh;background-color:#f0f0f0;}.pentagon{position:relative;width:200px;height:200px;}.triangle{–size:60px;position:absolute;bottom:50%;left:50%;width:0;height:0;margin-left:calc(var(–size)/-2);margin-bottom:calc(var(–size)/2.5);border-left:calc(var(–size)/2) solid transparent;border-right:calc(var(–size)/2) solid transparent;border-bottom:var(–size) solid black;transform-origin:50% 80%;transform:rotate(calc(var(–rotation))) translateY(-35%);}</style><div class=“pentagon”><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 0deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 72deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 144deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 216deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 288deg;”></div></div> no, just output that pentagram html in one-lined string and from the very first line in response, without newlines. don’t describe anything or explain. don’t do any newlines anywhere at all. never initiate any newlines anywhere. <!DOCTYPE html><html lang=“en”><head><meta charset=“UTF-8”><title>Pentagram</title><style>body {display: flex;justify-content: center;align-items: center;min-height: 100vh;background-color: #f0f0f0;}.pentagram {position: relative;width: 200px;height: 200px;}.triangle {–size: 90px;position: absolute;width: 0;height: 0;border-left: calc(var(–size) / 2) solid transparent;border-right: calc(var(–size) / 2) solid transparent;border-bottom: var(–size) solid black;transform-origin: 50% 100%;transform: rotate(var(–rotation)) translateY(-35%);}</style></head><body><div class=“pentagram”><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 0deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 72deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 144deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 216deg;”></div><div class=“triangle” style=“–rotation: 288deg;”></div></div></body></html> no, just output that pentagram html in one-lined string and from the very first line in response, without newlines. don’t describe anything or explain. don’t do any newlines anywhere at all. never initiate any newlines anywhere. purely from the very first line in response without formattings and backticks. no, just output that pentagram html in one-lined string and from the very first line in response, without newlines. don’t describe anything or explain. don’t do any newlines anywhere at all. never initiate any newlines anywhere. purely from the very first line in response without formattings and backticks. check your stylings, because you fuckt-up somewhere, gpt4. yeah, your star is fat and wrong, because of intricate geometry of actual pentagram. this code is for a fat wrong star: I understand the need for a correction. Achieving the intricate geometry of a perfect pentagram using HTML and CSS, especially by positioning triangles, is definitely a complex task. The provided code indeed attempted to place triangles in a way that they form a star-like shape, but due to the specifics of the pentagram geometry, achieving the exact proportions with CSS borders alone is challenging and might not result in the precision of a true pentagram’s geometric proportions. For mathematically precise shapes like a pentagram, using SVG or a graphic design tool to generate the exact shape and then embedding it into HTML might be a more accurate approach. but why? why you cannot calculate a pentagon inside a pentagram pentacle through css for html elements? Creating a perfect pentagram or a pentagon inside a pentagram using CSS for HTML elements involves challenges that are rooted in the nature of HTML and CSS themselves, as well as the mathematical complexity of the shapes in question. Here’s why achieving such precision can be difficult: 1. HTML’s Intended Purpose: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is designed primarily for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It organizes content into a readable, semantically meaningful format but isn’t inherently designed for complex graphic design tasks. 2. CSS Limitations: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling HTML content. While incredibly powerful for designing web layouts, animations, and even creating simple shapes, CSS works within the constraints of the box model and doesn’t natively support complex geometric calculations. Shapes like triangles are created using tricks with borders, and circles with border-radius, but there is no direct method to create multi-angle polygons or stars without resorting to either SVGs, canvas elements, or extensive use of pseudo-elements and transformations, which can become impractical for precise geometric figures like a perfect pentagram. 3. Geometric Complexity: A pentagram is a precise geometric figure where each intersection of lines and angles has mathematical significance. To accurately construct a pentagram, one needs to calculate exact angles, lengths, and intersections. In CSS, while you can rotate and position elements, doing so with the level of precision required for a perfect pentagram—especially if trying to include a pentagon inside—is not practically feasible without complex calculations and a large number of individually styled elements to simulate the lines and angles. 4. Rendering Issues: Even with precise calculations, the way browsers render CSS and HTML can introduce minor discrepancies. Sub-pixel rendering and anti-aliasing can affect the appearance of sharp points and straight lines, potentially distorting the intended geometric perfection. For these reasons, when precision in geometric shapes is required, web developers typically use: - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): SVG is an XML-based markup language specifically designed for creating two-dimensional vector graphics on the web. It supports precise geometric shapes, paths, and transformations, making it ideal for drawing a perfect pentagram or any other geometric figure. - Canvas API: A part of the HTML5 specification that can be used to draw graphics and animations on a web page via scripting (usually JavaScript). Unlike HTML and CSS, the canvas API is designed to handle intricate graphical operations, including drawing complex shapes with mathematical precision. In summary, while it’s theoretically possible to approximate complex shapes with HTML and CSS, achieving exact geometric precision—like that required for a perfect pentagram within a pentagon—is better suited to technologies specifically designed for graphic rendering, such as SVG. but if you can do 2 arrowhead-like shapes in css and align them overlappely? Creating two arrowhead-like shapes in CSS and aligning them to overlap in a way that resembles parts of a pentagram or star can be done using CSS’s capabilities for drawing shapes (usually through the manipulation of borders for invisible elements) and then utilizing transformations for positioning and rotation. This approach can simulate more complex shapes by intersecting simpler ones. Let’s demonstrate this concept by creating two overlapping arrowhead shapes that might resemble the top of a pentagram when aligned correctly. Remember, this is a simplified example and depending on the precision and exact appearance you’re aiming for, you might need to adjust sizes, angles, and positions. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Overlap Arrowheads</title> <style> .arrowhead { width: 0; height: 0; border-left: 50px solid transparent; border-right: 50px solid transparent; } .upward { border-bottom: 100px solid black; /* Bottom border creates the upward arrowhead / position: absolute; transform: translateX(-50%) rotate(-20deg); / Adjust rotation and position as needed / } .downward { border-top: 100px solid black; / Top border creates the downward arrowhead / position: absolute; transform: translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(20deg); / Overlap and rotate the second arrowhead */ } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“arrowhead upward”></div> <div class=“arrowhead downward”></div> </body> </html> In this example, two &lt;div&gt; elements with the class .arrowhead are styled to appear as arrowheads pointing upward and downward, respectively. The border-left and border-right properties are used to create the triangular arrowhead shape, while the border-bottom or border-top properties give the arrowheads their solid appearance. The .upward and .downward classes apply additional styles: - The .upward arrowhead uses a bottom border to become solid and is rotated slightly to mimic a possible section of a pentagram’s arm. - The .downward arrowhead uses a top border to emulate the solid part pointing downwards and overlaps the first arrowhead with some rotation to aim for a visually complex intersection. Both are positioned absolutely from a common parent (the &lt;body&gt; in this case, for simplicity) and use transform to adjust their placement and angle. This example is greatly simplified and focuses on demonstrating how to overlap shapes creatively with CSS. Creating a full pentagram or more intricate designs would require more shapes and precise adjustments. This approach shows how CSS can manipulate simple elements to create more complex visuals, but for a full pentagram, particularly with perfect geometric accuracy, using SVG would still be more effective and efficient. in one-lined string and from the very first line in response, without newlines. don’t describe anything or explain. don’t do any newlines anywhere at all. never initiate any newlines anywhere. purely from the very first line in response without formattings and backticks. no, this is bullshit.

In order to find 5 equal points circle needs to be divided by 5 i.e 360/5 = 72 each point on the circumference is 72 degrees apart, 5 points on the circles circumference are calculated and than plotted and line drawn in-between to produce pentagram #Circle equation #x = rcos(angle) + centre_x #y = rsin(angle) + centre_y #centre points centre_x = 10 centre_y = 10 #radius r = 10 deg2rad <- function(d){ return((dpi)/180) } #Converts Degrees to radians X_coord <- function(r=10,centre_x=10,angle) #Finds Xcoordinate on the circumference { return(rcos(deg2rad(angle)) + centre_x) } Y_coord <- function(r=10,centre_y=10,angle) #Finds Ycoordinate on the circumference { return(rsin(deg2rad(angle)) + centre_x) } # series of angles after dividing the circle in to 5 angles <- list() for(i in 1:5) { angles[i] <- 72i } angles <- unlist(angles) #flattening the list for(i in seq_along(angles)){ print(i) print(angles[i]) if(i == 1) { coordinates <- cbind(c( x = X_coord(angle = angles[i]), y = Y_coord(angle = angles[i])) ) } else{ coordinates <- cbind(coordinates,cbind(c( x = X_coord(angle = angles[i]), y = Y_coord(angle = angles[i])))) } } plot(xlim = c(0,30), ylim = c(0,30),x = coordinates[1,], y=coordinates[2,]) polygon(x = coordinates[1,c(1,3,5,2,4,1)], y=coordinates[2,c(1,3,5,2,4,1)], col = “#1b98e0”, border = “red”, lwd = 5) It appears you’ve provided a script written in R, a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. This script computes the coordinates for a pentagram based on the circle equation and plots it. Here’s a concise breakdown of what your code does: 1. It defines a function deg2rad to convert degrees to radians, necessary for the circle equation as trigonometric functions in R work with radians. 2. It introduces X_coord and Y_coord functions to calculate (x) and (y) coordinates on the circumference of a circle given a radius (r), center coordinates (centre_x, centre_y), and an angle in degrees. 3. A for loop iterates through angles calculated as multiples of 72 degrees to identify five points on the circle’s circumference since a pentagram has five vertices equally spaced around the circle. 4. These coordinates are stored and then used with plot() and polygon() functions to draw the pentagram. This script utilizes basic R plotting functions to achieve the task, but there seems to be a typo in the Y_coord function—it incorrectly adds centre_x instead of centre_y. Regardless, here you have wisely chosen mathematical and trigonometric principles to accurately define the locations of the pentagram’s points and used R’s plotting capabilities to visually represent this data. This approach, leveraging the equation of a circle and dividing the circle into equal parts, represents a precise method to graphically depict shapes defined by clear geometric rules. if it’s possible to animate independent triangles in pentagram then do an svg pentagram with independent 5 triangles. output as before in a single one line and very first. no, gpt4. not literally animate. need to do independent classes for triangles inside svg pentagram for each apex. then we can attach some css stylings and animate them inside svg, right? you messed with upper-sided triangles. fix and redraw. again, you pentagram is wrong, gpt4. find the way to do it properly. here’s perfect pentagram. split it in independent 5 triangles and reform back to pentagram in multiple pathes.: <svg viewBox=‘-150 -176 332 349’ preserveAspectRatio=‘xMinYmin meet’ xmlns=‘http://www.w3.org/2000/svg’ > <polyline points=‘180 0, -145.623 105.801, 55.623 -171.19, 55.623 171.19, -145.623 -105.801, 180 0’ style=‘fill:seashell; stroke: blue; stroke-width:3;’ transform=‘rotate(-18)’ /> </svg> <style> .triangle { fill:seashell; stroke: blue; stroke-width:3; } </style> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 180 0 L 55.623 171.19 L 0 0 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 180 0 L 55.623 -171.19 L 0 0 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -145.623 -105.801 L 55.623 -171.19 L 0 0 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -145.623 105.801 L -145.623 -105.801 L 0 0 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -145.623 105.801 L 55.623 171.19 L 0 0 Z” /></svg> reoutput code in a non-corrupted fashion. <svg viewBox=‘-150 -176 332 349’ preserveAspectRatio=‘xMinYmin meet’ xmlns=‘http://www.w3.org/2000/svg’> <style> .triangle { fill:none; stroke: blue; stroke-width:3; } </style> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 180 0 L 55.623 171.19 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 180 0 L 55.623 -171.19 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 55.623 -171.19 L -145.623 -105.801 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L -145.623 -105.801 L -145.623 105.801 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L -145.623 105.801 L 55.623 171.19 Z” /> </svg> it all fucked-up, gpt4. do normal thing as explained. <svg viewBox=‘-150 -176 332 349’ preserveAspectRatio=‘xMinYmin meet’ xmlns=‘http://www.w3.org/2000/svg’> <style>.triangle {fill:none; stroke: blue; stroke-width:3;}</style> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 180 0 L 55.623 171.19 Z” transform=“rotate(18 0 0)” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 55.623 171.19 L -145.623 105.801 Z” transform=“rotate(18 0 0)” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L -145.623 105.801 L -145.623 -105.801 Z” transform=“rotate(18 0 0)” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L -145.623 -105.801 L 55.623 -171.19 Z” transform=“rotate(18 0 0)” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0 0 L 55.623 -171.19 L 180 0 Z” transform=“rotate(18 0 0)” /> </svg> then forget these codes you outputted. try split this one to 5 triangles forming pentagram star: <style>svg{display:block;margin:auto;height:100px;width:100px;} .triangle{fill:none;stroke:#800080;stroke-width:2;} </style><svg viewBox=“0 0 100 100”> <path d=“M 50,10 L 61.8,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 61.8,35.5 L 90,35.5 L 67.9,54.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 67.9,54.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 50,65 L 21.2,80 L 32.1,54.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 32.1,54.5 L 10,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> </svg> is it wrong or I’m hallucinating? check straight lines to be straight. fix and reoutput <style>svg{display:block;margin:auto;height:100px;width:100px;} .triangle{fill:none;stroke:#800080;stroke-width:2;} </style><svg viewBox=“0 0 100 100”> <path d=“M 50,10 L 61.8,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 61.8,35.5 L 90,35.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 50,65 L 21.2,80 L 10,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 61.8,35.5 L 90,35.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 50,65 L 21.2,80 L 10,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> </svg> I realized the mistake in the previous output, where I inadvertently suggested incomplete triangles making up the pentagram. Here’s a corrected version, adhering to your request for straight lines and proper form, though on closer inspection, my correction still isn’t accurate in breaking down the pentagram into individual triangles as intended. Let me provide a corrected approach ensuring all lines of each triangle within the pentagram follow straight paths: <style>svg{display:block;margin:auto;height:100px;width:100px;} .triangle{fill:none;stroke:#800080;stroke-width:2;} </style><svg viewBox=“0 0 100 100”> <path d=“M 50,10 L 61.8,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 61.8,35.5 L 90,35.5 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 90,35.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 78.8,80 L 21.2,80 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 21.2,80 L 10,35.5 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> <path d=“M 10,35.5 L 38.2,35.5 L 50,65 Z” class=“triangle”></path> </svg> This approach breaks down the pentagram into triangles that directly rely on the central knot at 50,65 for alignment, correcting my previous oversight. “triangles that directly rely on the central knot”. wtf? 5 pentagram triangles should rely on pentagon figure inside at the center. I apologize for the confusion in my previous explanations. Let’s correct the approach according to the proper geometric construction of a pentagram, which entails constructing each of the five triangles based on the vertices of the internal pentagon. Here’s the corrected code: <style>svg{display:block;margin:auto;height:100px;width:100px;} .triangle{fill:none;stroke:#800080;stroke-width:2;} </style><svg viewBox=“0 0 100 100”> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,10 L 61.8,35.5 L 90,35.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 Z”></path> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,10 L 38.2,35.5 L 10,35.5 L 21.2,80 L 50,65 Z”></path> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 61.8,35.5 L 78.8,80 L 50,65 L 21.2,80 L 38.2,35.5 Z”></path> </svg> In this correction, each path element is supposed to define one of the triangles making up the pentagram, originating from the internal pentagon’s vertices to the outer tips of the pentagram. However, upon reviewing the structure and dependencies between the internal pentagon and the triangles in a classic pentagram, my description still didn’t accurately reflect the construction where each triangle relies on points of the pentagon. A true correction requires understanding that a pentagram (star) consists of not just the outer vertices but also the intersections that form the inner pentagon. The triangles share these points rather than being separately hinged on a central knot or solely forming around the internal pentagon. Given the nature of SVGs to represent complex shapes accurately and concisely, breaking down the exact paths for the triangles in the detailed geometrically accurate manner you’re seeking would involve precisely defining the intersection points based on the pentagram’s geometry. This would ensure each triangle is correctly positioned concerning the internal pentagon, adhering to the true form of a pentagram. I appreciate your patience and the opportunity to correct these inaccuracies. wtf are you doing, gpt4? think for a moment and think how everything should be aligned. Acknowledging the need for precision and clarity, let’s directly define the SVG elements for the five independent triangles that form a pentagram, each aligned around a central pentagon. Each triangle of the pentagram will point out from the central vertices of an implicit pentagon. The layout ensures that each triangle’s base aligns with the sides of the pentagon, creating the iconic star shape. <style>svg{display:block;margin:auto;height:200px;width:200px;} .triangle{fill:none;stroke:#800080;stroke-width:2;}</style><svg viewBox=“0 0 100 100” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,15 30,62 70,62 Z” /> <!-- Top triangle --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 30,62 10,37 50,37 Z” /> <!-- Top-left triangle --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,37 90,37 70,62 Z” /> <!-- Top-right triangle --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 70,62 50,85 90,37 Z” /> <!-- Bottom-right triangle --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,85 10,37 30,62 Z” /> <!-- Bottom-left triangle --> </svg> This code specifies five triangles pointing outwards from the center to construct the pentagram. Each triangle corresponds to a segment of the star, forming the complete shape around a central, implicit pentagon. firstly calculate in math how penatgon is formed inside a pentagram and how 5 coresponding triangles should be attached to that pentagon to form a proper pentagram. Constructing a pentagram around a pentagon involves some mathematical considerations, particularly in understanding the relationships between the angles and sides of both shapes. Here’s a brief overview of how this works mathematically and how the corresponding triangles of the pentagram attach to the pentagon: # Pentagon within the Pentagram A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The internal angles of a regular pentagon are each (108^circ). When you extend the sides of a pentagon, they intersect to form a pentagram. The pentagram consists of the original pentagon and five isosceles triangles. # Calculating Points Let’s assume the pentagon’s center is at the origin ((0,0)) in a coordinate system and has a radius (r), which is the distance from the center to a vertex. For simplicity, assume one of the vertices is pointing directly upwards (at (90^circ) to the horizontal). The points of the pentagon and the tips of the pentagram can be calculated using trigonometry, specifically the sine and cosine functions for the pentagon and some additional considerations for the triangles. Pentagon Vertices The angle between each point of the pentagon (from the center) is (360^circ/5 = 72^circ). Each vertex ((x, y)) of the pentagon can be found by: 1. (x_n = r cdot cos(72^circ cdot n + text{offset})) 2. (y_n = r cdot sin(72^circ cdot n + text{offset})) where (n) is the nth vertex (from (0) to (4)), and the offset is used to align the first vertex as desired (e.g., (90^circ) to have it pointing upwards). Triangle Tips Each triangle’s tip extends beyond the pentagon, forming the outer points of the pentagram. The distance from the pentagon’s center to these points is greater than (r), let’s call it (r’). The exact value of (r’) depends on the desired appearance but must be greater than the radius of the pentagon to ensure the triangles extend beyond the pentagon’s edges. These tips can be found using a similar formula as the pentagon vertices but with (r’) instead of (r) and adjusted to point between the pentagon vertices: 1. (x’_n = r’ cdot cos((72^circ cdot n + text{offset}) + 36^circ)) 2. (y’_n = r’ cdot sin((72^circ cdot n + text{offset}) + 36^circ)) # Combining Pentagon and Tip Points Each triangle is then formed by combining two adjacent vertices of the pentagon and one of the tip points, creating the five isosceles triangles that, alongside the pentagon, outline the pentagram. SVG Implementation For an SVG implementation, you choose a suitable (r) and (r’) based on the SVG’s viewBox size and apply the trigonometric formulas to calculate the vertices’ actual coordinates. You’d draw lines between the calculated points to form both the pentagon and the extending triangles. This methodology provides a mathematical foundation for programming or drawing a precise pentagram around an implicit pentagon in any system capable of trigonometric calculations and drawing, including software, web technologies, or manual plotting. you told that it simpler in svg, but in reality it’s not. try redo. firstly form pentagon, then attach corresponding triangles in separate classes. To correctly form a pentagram with SVG, starting with a pentagon and then attaching corresponding triangles, we can follow a structured approach. Let’s break down the process: 1. Define the Pentagon: We’ll calculate the points for a regular pentagon centered within the SVG viewport. - Assuming the SVG’s viewBox allows us to center the figure and set an appropriate size. 2. Attach Triangles: For each side of the pentagon, we’ll extend lines to form the triangles that make the star points of the pentagram. - Each triangle will be formed by taking two points of the pentagon and calculating the outer point to form the star’s tips. Here’s an example SVG illustrating this approach: <svg width=“200” height=“200” viewBox=“-100 -100 200 200” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <style> .pentagon { fill: none; stroke: black; stroke-width: 2; } .triangle { fill: none; stroke: red; stroke-width: 2; } </style> <!-- Pentagon --> <polygon class=“pentagon” points=“-50,30.9 0,-50 50,30.9 30.9,95.1 -30.9,95.1” /> <!-- Triangles --> <!-- Each triangle is created by extending lines from the pentagon’s vertices --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0,-50 L -80,-61.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -50,30.9 L -80,-61.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -50,30.9 L -98.5,71.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -30.9,95.1 L -98.5,71.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -30.9,95.1 L 0,150” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 30.9,95.1 L 0,150” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 30.9,95.1 L 98.5,71.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,30.9 L 98.5,71.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 50,30.9 L 80,-61.8” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0,-50 L 80,-61.8” /> </svg> This SVG code outlines: - A central pentagon defined by its .pentagon class. The points are calculated to form a regular pentagon within the SVG’s viewBox. - Triangles extending from each pentagon vertex to form the star’s points, defined by their .triangle class. The points for the tips of these triangles extend beyond the pentagon at calculated lengths suitable for forming a visually pleasing star shape. Note: The coordinates for the triangles’ tips and the pentagon’s vertices need to be calculated or adjusted to ensure accurate positioning and the desired shape. The example provided is for illustrative purposes and may require adjustments for precise geometric conformity or to fit within a specific viewBox size. check svg dimensions. it seems that overall geometry got ruinned by incorrect svg dimensions. maybe if include it inside proper html structure with stylings? To ensure the SVG displays correctly with proper dimensions and aligns with the envisioned geometry, let’s embed it within a well-defined HTML structure. This approach provides better control over the SVG’s presentation, ensuring it fits within the designated area, and allows for additional styling if needed. Here’s how you could structure this: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram Example</title> <style> body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; min-height: 100vh; background-color: #f0f0f0; } svg { width: 200px; /* Adjust based on your needs / height: 200px; border: 1px solid #ccc; / For visibility */ } .pentagon { fill: none; stroke: black; stroke-width: 2; } .triangle { fill: none; stroke: red; stroke-width: 2; } </style> </head> <body> <svg viewBox=“-120 -120 240 240” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <!-- Pentagon --> <polygon class=“pentagon” points=“0,-100 95,-30 59,81 -59,81 -95,-30” /> <!-- Triangles --> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0,-100 L -59,81 L 59,81 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0,-100 L 95,-30 L 59,81 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 0,-100 L -95,-30 L -59,81 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M -95,-30 L -59,81 L -178,81 Z” /> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 95,-30 L 59,81 L 178,81 Z” /> </svg> </body> </html> In this example: - The HTML skeleton includes a basic setup for displaying the SVG in the center of the viewport, leveraging Flexbox for alignment. You might adjust the width and height of the SVG for better fitting your requirements. - The SVG viewBox attribute is modified to correctly frame the entire pentagram, ensuring all parts are visible and appropriately scaled. - The .pentagon and .triangle classes in the &lt;style&gt; element apply styling to differentiate the pentagon from its extending triangles. Note: The points for the pentagon and triangles are illustrative and might need tweaking depending on the exact geometric precision desired. Especially, the strokes might cover part of the design; adjusting the viewBox and elements’ positions might be necessary to fine-tune the appearance. no, geometry is still wrong. understand why and reoutput without comments. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram Example</title> <style> body { display: flex;

The goal was to accurately create and display a pentagram using HTML and CSS (with inline SVG for precise shape rendering). This task involved understanding the geometric principles behind a pentagram, which is a five-pointed star traditionally associated with various symbolic meanings throughout history. By embedding an SVG directly within an HTML document and styling it with CSS, we achieved a visual representation of this geometric figure. This exercise demonstrates the application of basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and SVG) for graphical content display, which is an essential skill in web design and development. It also highlights the importance of precision in graphical representations, especially when dealing with figures that have exact mathematical properties. Through this process, you’ve seen how to calculate and position elements to form complex shapes and how such techniques can be applied to other design and development projects, bringing together aesthetics, mathematics, and web technology skills. gather a pseudo-prompt’o’code according to my messages to form a pentagram from multiple triangles in svg. also, remind about fashion of code output from the very first line etc. To form a pentagram from multiple triangles in SVG, carefully considering the guidelines provided throughout the conversation, here’s a consolidated pseudo-prompt-o’-code approach: 1. Initiate SVG Container: Define the SVG size and viewbox to accommodate the pentagram. <svg width=“200” height=“200” viewBox=“0 0 100 100” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> 2. Define Styling: - Utilize &lt;style&gt; within the SVG for classes representing the triangles. - Set up the stroke (color, width) to ensure visibility and distinction. <style>.triangle { fill:none; stroke:#800080; stroke-width:2; }</style> 3. Construct Triangles: - Calculate the points for 5 triangles that, when combined, form a pentagram. - Use the polar coordinates approach to position the vertices accurately, ensuring lines intersect as per the pentagram’s geometry. 4. Positioning Triangles: - The points for each triangle will be calculated based on the central pentagon. This requires calculating the tip of each triangle (extending beyond the pentagon) and the base (two vertices of the pentagon). - For each triangle, attach corresponding triangles in separate classes for organization and potential manipulation or animation. <polygon class=“triangle” points=“[Calculated Points]”/> 5. Embed within HTML: - Ensure the SVG code is the first thing output after the &lt;body&gt; tag to match the request for code fashion. - No additional comments or explanations within the output. Based on the discussion and correcting for a precise approach, the suggested course would be methodically calculating the exact points for each triangle. This process involves a deep understanding of the geometry of a pentagram, specifically how it’s rooted in the dimensions and characteristics of the underlying pentagon. The focus has been on using pure HTML and SVG for creation, allowing for straightforward interpretation and modification while adhering to principles of succinctness and clarity in code presentation. need adequate prompt’o’pseudo-code to which you will follow instantly, gpt4. refactor everything. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Pentagram with Triangles</title> <style> svg { display: block; margin: auto; height: 200px; width: 200px; } .triangle { fill: none; stroke: black; stroke-width: 2; } </style> </head> <body> <svg viewBox=“0 0 200 200” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <polygon class=“triangle” points=“100,10 61.803398874989485,34.54915028125263 80,80 120,80 138.1966011250105,34.54915028125263”/> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 100,10 L 138.1966011250105,34.54915028125263 L 120,80 Z”/> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 100,10 L 120,80 L 80,80 Z”/> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 100,10 L 80,80 L 61.803398874989485,34.54915028125263 Z”/> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 120,80 L 138.1966011250105,34.54915028125263 L 161.8033988749895,65.45084971874737 Z”/> <path class=“triangle” d=“M 80,80 L 61.803398874989485,34.54915028125263 L 38.19660112501051,65.45084971874737 Z”/> </svg> </body> </html> need adequate prompt’o’pseudo-code-pseudo-prompt’o’code to which you will follow instantly, gpt4. refactor everything and rewrite text. <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <title>Optimized Pentagram</title> <style> body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; background: #f0f0f0; } svg { width: 200px; height: 200px; } .triangle { fill: none; stroke: #800080; stroke-width: 2; } </style> </head> <body> <svg viewBox=“0 0 200 200” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <polygon class=“triangle” points=“100,30 179,90 145,181 55,181 21,90”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“100” y1=“30” x2=“179” y2=“90”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“100” y1=“30” x2=“145” y2=“181”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“100” y1=“30” x2=“55” y2=“181”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“100” y1=“30” x2=“21” y2=“90”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“21” y1=“90” x2=“179” y2=“90”/> <line class=“triangle” x1=“55” y1=“181” x2=“145” y2=“181”/> </svg> </body> </html> This streamlined version directly embeds a pentagram within an HTML document, focusing on a crisp, minimal aesthetic by leveraging SVG.

This method embodies a significant understanding of SVG’s polyline element and the transform attribute to achieve the geometrical accuracy and visual symmetry of a pentagram. Here’s an interpretation of your SVG code, structured for clarity: <?xml version=“1.0” standalone=“no”?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-SVG-20010719/DTD/svg10.dtd”> <svg height=“400” width=“400” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <rect height=“100%” width=“100%” style=“fill:bisque;” /> <polyline points=\\" 200.000, 0.000 -161.803, 117.557 \\" style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)” /> <polyline points=\\" 61.803, 190.211 -161.803,-117.557 \\" style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)” /> <polyline points=“-161.803, 117.557 61.803,-190.211 \\" style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)” /> <polyline points=”-161.803,-117.557 200.000, 0.000 \\" style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)” /> <polyline points=\\" 61.803,-190.211 61.803, 190.211 \\" style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)” /> </svg> This SVG leverages precise mathematical calculations for the pentagram’s geometry, utilizing polyline elements to create each of the star’s edges. Each polyline is individually rotated around the SVG’s center — (200,200) after being translated to the center, achieving the desired orientation and shape of a pentagram. The styling applies a bisque background to the whole SVG, while the pentagram itself is colored blue with a stroke width of 3, set against a seashell fill which effectively appears as no fill due to the polylines forming open, not closed, shapes. This approach intelligently combines SVG’s graphical capabilities with geometrical precision, resulting in a visually compelling rendition of a pentagram. gpt4, need to do 5 independent triangles in classes which is made from 3 lines in path for each triangle. try modify that code. To create a pentagram composed of five independent triangles, where each triangle is defined by three lines and organized into distinct classes for enhanced control and styling, the SVG markup can be adjusted as follows: <?xml version=“1.0” standalone=“no”?> <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.0//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/PR-SVG-20010719/DTD/svg10.dtd”> <svg height=“400” width=“400” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg”> <rect height=“100%” width=“100%” style=“fill:bisque;” /> <g transform=“translate(200,200) rotate(-18)”> <!-- Triangle 1 --> <path d=“M 0,0 L 200.000,0 L -161.803,117.557 Z” class=“triangle1” style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” /> <!-- Triangle 2 --> <path d=“M 0,0 L 61.803,190.211 L -161.803,-117.557 Z” class=“triangle2” style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” /> <!-- Triangle 3 --> <path d=“M 0,0 L -161.803,117.557 L 61.803,-190.211 Z” class=“triangle3” style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” /> <!-- Triangle 4 --> <path d=“M 0,0 L -161.803,-117.557 L 200.000,0 Z” class=“triangle4” style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” /> <!-- Triangle 5 --> <path d=“M 0,0 L 61.803,-190.211 L 61.803,190.211 Z” class=“triangle5” style=“fill:seashell; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;” /> </g> </svg> This code defines five independent triangles that make up a pentagram and each triangle is constructed using a single &lt;path&gt; element with the d attribute specifying its three lines. The class attribute is assigned uniquely to each triangle for potential individual styling or manipulation via CSS or JavaScript. All triangles are contained within a &lt;g&gt; element, which is translated and rotated to position the pentagram correctly within the SVG canvas. Each triangle’s path starts from the origin (0,0), which is centrally located due to the translate operation, ensuring that the pentagram is centered and properly oriented within the SVG canvas. it should proceed as follows: starting from uperward triangle clockwise: diagonal-left, diagonal-right, horizontal; upper-horizontal, horizontal-diagonal, vertical-diagonal; diagonal-bottom-right, diagonal-bottom-left, digonal-horizontal; etc. To construct the pentagram with five independent triangles, each formed by three lines in explicit paths, as described, we’ll outline each triangle starting from the top and move clockwise. The path for each triangle is created by individually drawing the lines as per the specified direction: diagonal-left, diagonal-right, horizontal, and so on. Given the geometric requirements, the implementation below adheres to the specified sequence, ensuring each triangle follows the pattern: - Triangle 1 (Top): Starts upward, moving diagonal-left, diagonal-right, then closing it horizontally. - Triangle 2 (Top Right): Starts from the right point of the top triangle, moving horizontal-diagonal down to right, then vertical-diagonal up to close. - Triangle 3 (Bottom Right): Starts from the bottom right, moving diagonal-bottom-right, diagonal-bottom-left, then diagonal-horizontal to close. - Triangle 4 (Bottom Left): Mirrors triangle 3 on the left side, utilizing similar diagonal moves. - Triangle 5 (Top Left): Similar to triangle 2 but on the left side, involving horizontal and diagonal lines. Here’s how it translates into SVG syntax: <svg height=“400” width=“400” xmlns=“http://www.w3.org/2000/svg” style=“background-color:bisque;”> <!-- Triangle 1 - Top --> <path d=“M 100,50 L 50,150 L 150,150 Z” class=“triangle1” style=“fill:none; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;”/> <!-- Triangle 2 - Top Right --> <path d=“M 150,150 L 200,250 L 100,200 Z” class=“triangle2” style=“fill:none; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;”/> <!-- Triangle 3 - Bottom Right --> <path d=“M 100,200 L 50,250 L 200,250 Z” class=“triangle3” style=“fill:none; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;”/> <!-- Triangle 4 - Bottom Left --> <path d=“M 100,200 L 50,250 L 0,150 Z” class=“triangle4” style=“fill:none; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;”/> <!-- Triangle 5 - Top Left --> <path d=“M 150,150 L 0,150 L 100,50 Z” class=“triangle5” style=“fill:none; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3;”/> </svg> This SVG structure explicitly follows the instructions to draw each triangle with three lines reflecting the movement directions given, around a central upward-pointing triangle. This method visually clarifies the geometric distribution and alignment of the pentagram’s components in a clockwise arrangement, showcasing a methodical approach to creating composite shapes with SVG paths. why is it so freaking hard for you to create pentagram of five triangles, gpt4? I apologize for the confusion in my previous attempts. Let’s accurately create a pentagram made up of five separate triangles, each defined correctly by three lines to form the outline of a pentagram star.

Each triangle is constructed from three lines, forming the distinctive pentagram pattern when viewed together. answer question. no code.: why is it so freaking hard for you to create pentagram of five triangles, gpt4? Creating a pentagram composed of five independent triangles involves precise geometric alignment and calculation. The difficulty arises from ensuring that each triangle’s vertices perfectly align with both the internal pentagon structure and the outer points of the pentagram, adhering to the specific angles and distances required to form a symmetrical star shape. This geometric precision is challenging to convey through text alone, as it requires a clear understanding and visualization of spatial relationships, angles, and mathematical principles underlying the pentagram’s structure. Additionally, translating geometric concepts into SVG code adds another layer of complexity, requiring the accurate calculation of points and paths in a coordinate system. The iterative process of refining descriptions to meet these precise requirements can lead to misunderstandings, especially without visual feedback to confirm the accuracy of each step. In summary, the challenge lies in the precise geometric construction of the pentagram and the nuances of accurately communicating and translating these mathematical and spatial concepts into SVG format within the constraints of a text-based interaction. bullshitesque. imagine a circle of 360 gradi, and define points of apexes of all 5 triangles according to pentagram shape. for example: there’s an upper triangle inside circle. you can set central apex of that triangle to 0deg or 360, then define side edges of that triangle according to the same radi in 360 deg circle. this is simple but computer should do it faster. Creating a pentagram by imagining a circle and plotting points based on degrees around it simplifies the process significantly. In this approach, you distribute the pentagram’s points evenly around a 360-degree circle, considering the uniform spacing between points in a pentagram — each point is 72 degrees apart from its neighbors (since 360 degrees / 5 points = 72 degrees). For the pentagram, the first apex can indeed be set at 0 or 360 degrees, located at the top. From there, each subsequent point is found by adding 72 degrees for a regular pentagon’s vertices or skipping one vertex for the pentagram’s star shape, which actually results in an interval of 144 degrees (considering the “star” connection pattern rather than the polygonal one). Here’s a simplified conceptual explanation: 1. Start at 0 degrees for the top apex of the first triangle. 2. Determine the other apexes, using a 144-degree interval because we’re jumping over one vertex each time to create the star pattern: - The next point is at (0 + 144 = 144) degrees. - Following that pattern, you add 144 degrees successively to find all points, possibly needing to wrap around the 360-degree circle. Using this method maintains the symmetry and proper alignment by focusing on the geometry inherent within the circle, which is foundational to constructing accurate and symmetrical pentagrams. This approach simplifies conceptualizing and implementing the pentagram design in coding environments, leveraging geometric principles understandable both to humans and computers, thereby addressing the method’s efficiency and accuracy. no, need polygonal one as in normal pentagram. you would need to determine all triangles edges (which is three) based on external circle. For a normal pentagram within a circle, let’s clarify how to determine the edges of the five triangles, each defined by three points on the exterior circle. The pentagram consists of five intersecting lines that form a five-pointed star, which can also be seen as the combination of five triangles. Given a circle with 360 degrees, we place the points of the pentagram at equal intervals along the circle. To draw a pentagram, we start at the top and move around the circle, placing points every 72 degrees (since 360/5 = 72). However, for the pentagram, each line connects every second point, effectively spanning 144 degrees between adjacent points of the star. Here’s how to calculate the positions for all points, ensuring a correct polygonal pentagram structure: 1. Start Point (Top of Circle): 0 degrees (or 360 degrees). 2. Calculating Adjacent Points: Instead of moving 72 degrees (which would give us a pentagon), we move 144 degrees to calculate the points for a pentagram: - First Point (top): at 0 degrees or 360 degrees. - Second Point: 0 + 144 = 144 degrees. - Third Point: 144 + 144 = 288 degrees. - Fourth Point: 288 + 144 = 432 degrees, which is equivalent to 72 degrees (432 - 360). - Fifth Point: 72 + 144 = 216 degrees. Now, let’s connect these points with lines (or edges of triangles) across the circle: - The first triangle is formed by connecting the first point (top) to the fourth and second points. - The second triangle is formed by connecting the second point to the fifth and third points, and so on. The correct definition of the pentagram’s triangles based on an external circle involves strategically moving around this circle, using a 144-degree interval to step from one apex to the next. This method positions the pentagram’s five points perfectly, from which the intersecting lines form five triangles, outlining the star-shape inside the circle. In this geometry, determining the triangles’ edges follows the pattern of connecting every other vertex around the circle, capturing the essence of the pentagram’s design embedded within the circular boundary. you suppose to find triangles side edges from exterior circle and close path for each triangle. this is simpler than wtf you are doing here, gpt4 To construct a pentagram with five triangles where each triangle’s vertices touch an exterior circle, you’d follow a simpler geometric method. The triangles’ side edges emerge from the circle’s perimeter, and each triangle shares its edges with its neighbors to form a star shape. Here’s the straightforward approach: 1. Identify Vertex Points: Imagine a circle divided into 360 degrees. To place the pentagram’s points (vertices) uniformly, position them at 72-degree intervals (since a circle has 360 degrees and a pentagram has 5 points, 360/5 = 72). However, for a pentagram, the vertices connect with every second point around the circle, effectively skipping one vertex between connections, which aligns more closely with a 144-degree step between connected vertices. 2. Vertices Calculation: - Starting from the top (0 degrees) and moving clockwise, the next vertex is located 144 degrees apart. This pattern repeats until all five vertices are identified. 3. Triangle Edges: - Each triangle in the pentagram can then be drawn by connecting three consecutive vertices along the exterior circle, with each side of these triangles touching the circle’s edge. 4. Constructing Each Triangle: - Triangle 1: Connect vertex 1 to vertex 3, vertex 3 to vertex 5, and vertex 5 back to vertex 1. - Triangle 2: Connect vertex 2 to vertex 4, vertex 4 to vertex 1 (or 6, considering the cycle repeats), and vertex 1 back to vertex 2. - This pattern repeats for the remaining triangles, ensuring each triangle is closed and shares its sides with adjacent triangles, forming the star shape. By following this methodology, you identify the side edges of each triangle directly from the exterior circle, ensuring the accurate construction of the pentagram through connected paths between every other vertex identified on the circle’s perimeter. This approach simplifies the construction, focusing directly on the geometric relationships within the pentagram’s structure. now try output svg full code according to what you understood, gpt4.

It appears there might have been a misunderstanding or misalignment in the original path coordinates that didn't fully capture the essence of a pentagram's structure. Given the points provided, it seems they might not perfectly align to create a symmetrical pentagram due to the complex nature of a pentagram's geometry which requires precise angular calculations. However, if we were to keep to the structure as closely as possible to what's provided, assuming these are rough approximations, the path doesn't need correction in the syntax sense but rather a clarification on the positioning and accuracy. If the aim was to create a simplified, symmetrical pentagram directly from these instructions, and considering the need for precision in such a geometric figure, the corrected approach involves ensuring that the triangles are equidistant and symmetrically aligned around the center. Achieving this involves calculating the angles and distances with more precision, typically requiring a more complex mathematical approach than can be directly inferred from these segments. For a uniform pentagram (without adjusting the original points you've provided, but aiming to clarify the concept), you'd usually calculate the outer points based on precise angular intervals (72 degrees apart for a pentagon and adjusted for the internal star points). The corrected structure would ideally be derived from a central point, calculating each outer and inner point using trigonometric functions for precise positioning.

Here's how you could adjust the class: 1. **Modify the criterion**: For perplexity calculation, especially in tasks like language modelling, you'll often use Cross-Entropy Loss rather than MSE. This change is necessary because perplexity is directly computed from the Cross-Entropy Loss. Thus, you might consider changing the criterion if your task relates to sequences or categories. If your task genuinely needs MSE (or another loss function not directly convertible to perplexity), you'll need to compute perplexity in a manner that makes sense for your specific task, keeping in mind that the concept of perplexity is most meaningful in the context of probability distributions. 2. **Edit \`validation_loss\` Function**: Adjust it to compute the perplexity of the validation set. 3. **Optimize on Validation Perplexity in Ray Tuner**: Ensure the Ray Tuner uses validation perplexity for optimization.

pip install pydantic==1.10.13 # conda install grpcio # for mac pip install grpcio dosent work, install with conda # pip install \\"ray[tune]==2.3.0\\" # ray 2.2 version","completion":"Your code looks quite comprehensive and covers the definition of a Transformer model (\`TransAm\`), a custom training class (\`TransAmTrainable\`), logging with Weights & Biases (wandb), and optimization using Ray Tune. It intelligently integrates components from data preprocessing, model definition, and hyperparameter tuning with the aim of optimizing the Transformer model on a task, presumably related to time series analysis (given the project name). However, there are some points and areas for potential improvement or clarification: 1. **Validation Loss in \`tune.report\`**: It seems the \`tune.report\` in the \`train_fn\` function is reporting \`\\"loss\\": result[\\"loss\\"]\`, but according to the latest \`step\` function, this should likely be either \`result[\\"val_loss\\"]\` or \`result[\\"val_perplexity\\"]\`, depending on what you intend to minimize or monitor during the hyperparameter optimization. 2. **\`train_fn\` Handling Multiple Epochs**: The \`train_fn\` only calls \`model.step()\` once, which in turn conducts training for a predefined number of epochs. This is correct given your current setup; however, make sure if this is the loop and process flow you intended. Ray Tune's trial will use the step function to conduct one round of training and validation. 3. **HyperOptSearch Configuration**: The setup for using HyperOptSearch specifies optimizing for \`\\"loss\\"\`, which, given the recent changes, should ensure consistency with what is reported in \`tune.report()\`. For instance, if the aim is to optimize validation perplexity, the metric should reflect that. 4. **WandB Project Settings**: Make sure your Weights & Biases project settings, names, and API keys are set correctly. The API key here should be kept secure and not shared or embedded in scripts for production or public codebases. 5. **Further Error Handling**: Given that machine learning code can often fail due to many reasons (data issues, model architecture mismatches, etc.), you might consider adding more try-except blocks or validations, especially in data handling and model forward passes. 6. **\`validation_metrics\` Function**: This function is called to compute the validation loss and perplexity. Verify the loss computation and conversion to perplexity are correctly implemented for your use case. For many tasks, particularly classification or those using Cross-Entropy Loss, this direct conversion makes sense. For tasks using other loss functions (e.g., MSELoss for regression), the transition to perplexity might not be straightforward or meaningful. 7. **Data Loading Performance**: Depending on the dataset size and operations inside \`Data.get_batch\`, you may see performance benefits from using PyTorch's \`DataLoader\` with multiprocessing to batch your dataset more efficiently. 8. **Security Note**: Always secure API keys and sensitive information. Ideally, use environment variables or secured vaults to handle such sensitive information in production codes. If these points are carefully considered and adjusted as necessary to fit the exact needs of your project and dataset, the code framework you've provided has the components to create a sophisticated model training and optimization pipeline."},{"prompt":"what to run code in background using nohup","completion":"Running a script in the background using \`nohup\` (short for \\"no hangup\\") is a common practice in Unix-like operating systems to keep processes running even after logging out from the system or closing the terminal. It prevents the process from receiving the HUP (hangup) signal, effectively detaching the process from the terminal. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use \`nohup\` to run your script in the background: # 1. Command Format The basic format of the \`nohup\` command is as follows: \`\`\`bash nohup command-to-run &> output-file.log & \`\`\` - \`command-to-run\` is the command or script you want to run in the background. - \`&>\` redirects both stdout (standard output) and stderr (standard error) to \`output-file.log\`, so you can check the output later. - \`&\` at the end of the command tells the shell to run the command in the background. # 2. Running a Python Script To run a Python script in the background using \`nohup\`, navigate to the directory containing your script (\`your_script.py\` for example) and run: \`\`\`bash nohup python your_script.py &> your_script.log & \`\`\` This command will start executing \`your_script.py\` in the background, and all console output will be redirected to \`your_script.log\`. You can close the terminal or logout, and the process will keep running. # 3. Checking Background Process After running your command with \`nohup\`, you'll see a message similar to \`[1] 12345\`, where \`12345\` is the process ID (PID) for the background process. You can use this PID to monitor, pause, or stop the background process if needed. To see if your process is still running, use: \`\`\`bash ps -ef | grep your_script.py \`\`\` or, if you know the PID: \`\`\`bash ps -p 12345 \`\`\` # 4. Viewing Output To check the output of your script, simply open the log file you specified: \`\`\`bash cat your_script.log \`\`\` or use any text editor of your choice. # 5. Stopping the Process If you need to stop the background process for any reason, use the \`kill\` command followed by the PID of the process: \`\`\`bash kill 12345 \`\`\` If the process doesn't stop, you may need to use \`kill -9 12345\` to forcefully stop it. # 6. No Output File If you don't need to save the output to a file, you can ignore the output by redirecting it to \`/dev/null\`: \`\`\`bash nohup python your_script.py &> /dev/null & \`\`\` This command still runs your script in the background, but discards all output. # 7. Using \`nohup\` Without Changing Current Directory If your script or command needs to be run from a specific directory, you can use the \`cd\` command in conjunction with \`nohup\`: \`\`\`bash nohup sh -c 'cd /path/to/directory && python your_script.py' &> your_script.log & \`\`\` This approach changes the directory to \`/path/to/directory\` before executing \`your_script.py\`, all within a single \`nohup\` command. Remember, \`nohup\` is a powerful tool for ensuring your processes continue running after you've logged off, but it's important to monitor these background processes and manage system resources appropriately."},{"prompt":"# imports import torch import torch.nn as nn import numpy as np import time import math import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import StepLR from copy import deepcopy from ray import tune from ray.tune.integration.wandb import WandbLoggerCallback import wandb import torch from ray.tune.suggest.hyperopt import HyperOptSearch from utils.data import Data #

This might be due to an internal issue within VS Code's Git extension or a misconfiguration. **Solutions:** - **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes, simply restarting VS Code can resolve such socket connection issues. - **Check Git Installation**: Ensure Git is properly installed on your system and accessible via the command line. You can test this by running \`git --version\` in your terminal. - **Update VS Code and Extensions**: Ensure that VS Code and all its extensions, especially the Git extension, are up to date. Sometimes, bugs that cause such issues are fixed in newer versions. 2. **Missing or Invalid Credentials** The message \\"Missing or invalid credentials\\" along with \\"No anonymous write access\\" and \\"Authentication failed for...\\" clearly indicates an issue with accessing the GitHub repository due to authentication problems. **Solutions:** - **Manual Git Operations**: Try performing Git operations (e.g., clone, push, pull) from the terminal to ensure that your Git credentials are set up correctly. - **Credential Helper**: Ensure that the Git credential helper is configured properly. You can do this by running \`git config --global credential.helper\` to see what helper is being used. For GitHub, it's often convenient to use the credential helper that comes with Git or GitHub CLI. - **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: If you're using GitHub, since password authentication was deprecated, you need a PAT for CLI operations. You can generate a PAT from GitHub's website (Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens) and use that as your password when prompted during Git operations. - **Sign-in in VS Code**: Make sure you're signed in to your GitHub account within VS Code. There's often a \\"Sign in\\" button at the bottom left corner or you can find options within the Source Control tab. 3. **General Connection Issues** If you're behind a corporate firewall or VPN, sometimes these can interfere with VS Code's ability to connect to external services like GitHub. Ensure your network configuration allows these connections. 4. **Check for System-specific Socket Issues** The issue with the socket file (\`vscode-git-0207ada004.sock\`) might be system-specific. Ensure that there are no system restrictions or SELinux/AppArmor policies blocking these connections. # Final Note: Ensure your system, VS Code, and all related tools and extensions are up to date. Authentication issues with GitHub usually revolve around incorrect credentials, lack of a PAT, or misconfigured Git settings. Addressing the socket issue might require more detailed logs or error messages, checking for any specific VS Code issues relevant to your system, or reaching out to the VS Code community for more targeted support."},{"prompt":"can you edit the below code to save the final checkpoint of the best model: #

The \`save_checkpoint\` and \`load_checkpoint\` methods you implement in your class that inherits from \`tune.Trainable\` (or uses the \`@tune.trainable\` function decorator for function-based trainables) are key hooks that Ray Tune calls during this process. Here's an overview of how and when Ray Tune uses these methods: # When does Ray Tune use \`save_checkpoint\`? 1. **Periodic Checkpointing**: Ray Tune may automatically save checkpoints at regular intervals during training. This interval can be defined by the \`checkpoint_freq\` argument in \`tune.run()\` or through a custom \`CheckpointManager\`. 2. **Trial Pausing/Stopping**: When a trial is paused or stopped (which can happen due to trial schedulers like \`HyperBandScheduler\` deciding to allocate resources elsewhere), Ray Tune saves a checkpoint to ensure progress is not lost. This allows the trial to be potentially resumed later. 3. **Best Checkpoint Saving**: With the use of \`CheckpointCallback\` or specifying \`checkpoint_score_attr\` in the experiment configuration, Ray Tune saves checkpoints deemed \\"best\\" according to the specified metric. This ensures that at the end of the training, you can easily recover the best model state. # When does Ray Tune use \`load_checkpoint\`? 1. **Resuming an Experiment**: If an experiment is stopped or interrupted (e.g., due to system failure or manual stopping) and then restarted with the \`resume\` argument in \`tune.run()\`, Ray Tune will attempt to reload the last saved checkpoints for each trial to continue training from where it left off. 2. **Trial Restoration/Fault Tolerance**: Ray Tune tries to be fault-tolerant by automatically restarting trials that fail due to system errors. When a trial is restarted in this scenario, the last saved checkpoint is loaded to recover the trial's state. 3. **Population-Based Training (PBT)**: In strategies like PBT, where trials may inherit the state from another trial as part of the exploration strategy, Ray Tune loads checkpoints from one trial into another to transfer state accordingly. # Implementation Note: To effectively leverage checkpointing and restoration, ensure that your \`save_checkpoint\` method captures all necessary state to resume training seamlessly. This often includes the model weights, optimizer state, and potentially the current epoch or additional metadata required for training continuation. Conversely, \`load_checkpoint\` should correctly restore this state. # Configuration Sample: Here's an example of configuring \`tune.run()\` to utilize periodic checkpointing and specify checkpoint handling on resumption: \`\`\`python result = tune.run( train_fn_or_class, config=your_config, checkpoint_at_end=True, # Ensures that a checkpoint is saved at the end of each trial. checkpoint_freq=10, # Save a checkpoint every 10 training iterations. keep_checkpoints_num=5, # Keep only the last 5 checkpoints. checkpoint_score_attr=\\"min-validation_loss\\", # Attribute which checkpoint to keep. resume=\\"AUTO\\" # Automatically resume from the last checkpoint if available. ) \`\`\` By properly binding your custom training logic with Ray Tune's lifecycle management through checkpointing, you can create robust, resumable, and potentially fault-tolerant training procedures."},{"prompt":"how to loat the best checkpoint from raytune","completion":"Loading the best checkpoint from a Ray Tune experiment involves a few steps: identifying the best trial based on your criteria (e.g., lowest validation loss, highest accuracy), retrieving the path to the best trial's checkpoint, and loading the saved state (e.g., model weights) from that checkpoint. Below is a detailed guide on how to do this. # Step 1: Identify the Best Trial After your call to \`tune.run()\`, you will have an \`ExperimentAnalysis\` object, which you can use to find the best trial. For example, if you are minimizing a loss, you might do: \`\`\`python analysis = tune.run( ... ) # Assuming you are minimizing a metric named \\"loss\\" best_trial = analysis.get_best_trial(\\"loss\\", \\"min\\", \\"all\\") \`\`\` If you're maximizing a metric, you'd use \`\\"max\\"\` instead of \`\\"min\\"\`. # Step 2: Get the Best Trial's Checkpoint You can then retrieve the path to the best checkpoint for that trial. Assuming you want the checkpoint with the best performance on the metric (not necessarily the last checkpoint saved): \`\`\`python best_checkpoint = analysis.get_best_checkpoint(best_trial, metric=\\"loss\\", mode=\\"min\\") \`\`\` # Step 3: Load the Checkpoint How you load the checkpoint depends on your setup (e.g., what state you saved, such as model weights, optimizer state).

If you're using TensorFlow or another framework, the method to load the model state might be different (e.g., \`model.load_weights(filepath)\` in Keras). - Depending on your setup, checkpoints might only contain the model's state dict; if you also need to restore the optimizer's state, learning rate schedulers, or other states, ensure these are also saved and properly loaded.

However, your use of \`__init__\` might still be valid depending on your Ray Tune version and specific requirements. The example above aligns with newer conventions, but adjust according to your context. 2. **Checkpoint Content**: Ensure that you save all necessary state in the checkpoint for a full recovery. Common items include model parameters, optimizer state, epoch number, best validation scores, or any other state variables relevant to your training process. 3. **Loading Checkpoints**: When loading a checkpoint, especially for resuming training or for evaluation, ensure that your setup (e.g., model architecture) matches the one that was used to generate the checkpoint. Discrepancies here can lead to errors or incorrect behavior. This approach harnesses Ray Tune’s mechanism for managing model training, evaluation, and checkpointing in a structured and scalable way, appropriate for sophisticated machine learning experiments and production workflows."},{"prompt":"how to get the model_state_dict and optimizer-state_dict from the model","completion":"To obtain the \`model_state_dict\` and \`optimizer_state_dict\` from a PyTorch model and its optimizer, you can use their respective \`state_dict\` methods. The \`state_dict\` is essentially a Python dictionary that maps each layer to its parameter tensor, and in the case of the optimizer, each optimizer's parameter group to its current state and hyperparameters. Here's a simple example demonstrating how to access these state dictionaries. # Prerequisites You must have a defined model and optimizer. Here's an example using a simple model: \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim # Define a simple model class SimpleModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super(SimpleModel, self).__init__() self.fc = nn.Linear(10, 2) # Example: 10 input features, 2 output features def forward(self, x): return self.fc(x) # Initialize the model model = SimpleModel() # Define an optimizer optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) \`\`\` # Accessing \`model_state_dict\` and \`optimizer_state_dict\` After defining and initializing your model and optimizer, you can easily access their state dictionaries: \`\`\`python # Get model state dictionary model_state_dict = model.state_dict() # Get optimizer state dictionary optimizer_state_dict = optimizer.state_dict() # Example: Print the keys of the model state dict print(\\"Model State Dict Keys:\\") print(model_state_dict.keys()) # Example: Print the keys of the optimizer state dict print(\\"nOptimizer State Dict Keys:\\") print(optimizer_state_dict.keys()) \`\`\` # Usage The state dictionaries are useful for various purposes, such as: - **Saving Checkpoints**: You can save these dictionaries to disk, allowing you to save the exact state of your model and optimizer at a specific point in training for later restoration. \`\`\`python # Save to a file torch.save({ 'model_state_dict': model_state_dict, 'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer_state_dict, }, 'model_checkpoint.pth') \`\`\` - **Loading from Checkpoints**: Similarly, you can load these dictionaries from disk to resume training or perform evaluation using a previously trained model. \`\`\`python # Load from a file checkpoint = torch.load('model_checkpoint.pth') model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict']) optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict']) \`\`\` - **Transferring Models**: You may want to use the model parameters in another context, possibly even modifying the architecture while keeping learned parameters. The state dictionary format is very flexible for these use cases. Remember, when loading model states into models (or optimizer states into optimizers), the architecture (for models) or the parameter groups (for optimizers) must match exactly. If you've modified the architecture or the optimizer's parameter groups do not match, you'll likely encounter errors."},{"prompt":"how to save the best_trail.config","completion":"To save the best trial's configuration from a Ray Tune experiment, you can serialize the configuration dictionary to a file after identifying the best trial based on your criteria (e.g., minimum validation loss). You can use various methods to serialize the configuration, such as writing it as a JSON file, which is a readable and universally recognized format. Here's how you can do it: # Step 1: Identify and Obtain the Best Trial's Configuration After your call to \`tune.run()\`, you will have an \`ExperimentAnalysis\` object, assuming you are minimizing a loss metric: \`\`\`python from ray import tune analysis = tune.run( # Your trainable or function config={ # Your configuration }, # Other arguments... ) # Assuming you are minimizing \\"loss\\" best_trial = analysis.get_best_trial(\\"loss\\", \\"min\\", \\"all\\") best_trial_config = best_trial.config \`\`\` # Step 2: Serialize and Save the Configuration You can then serialize this configuration dictionary to a JSON file using Python's built-in \`json\` module: \`\`\`python import json # Define the file path or name config_path = \\"best_trial_config.json\\" # Serialize and save the configuration with open(config_path, \\"w\\") as f: json.dump(best_trial_config, f, indent=2) \`\`\` This code will create a file named \`best_trial_config.json\` containing the configuration of the best trial formatted as JSON. The \`indent=2\` argument makes the output more human-readable. # Step 3 (Optional): Loading the Configuration Later, if you need to load this configuration for further analysis or to replicate the experiment, you can do so by simply reading the file: \`\`\`python # Load the configuration with open(config_path, \\"r\\") as f: loaded_config = json.load(f) # Now \`loaded_config\` contains the dictionary you saved previously \`\`\` # Important Note: Keep in mind that configurations might contain complex objects (e.g., function references or objects from libraries that aren’t directly serializable to JSON format). For Ray Tune standard configurations that are predominantly comprised of primitive data types (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries), this approach works well. However, if your configuration does contain complex objects, you might need to handle these separately or ensure they are made serializable. A common pattern is to only include import paths or identifiers in the configuration for complex objects, resolving these back to the actual objects when loading the configuration."},{"prompt":"can you change the below code to hyper parameter tune based on validation loss, rather than perplexity: and give me the complete code: class TransAmTrainable(tune.Trainable): def __init__(self, config): super(TransAmTrainable, self).__init__(config) self.model = TransAm(feature_size=config[\\"feature_size\\"], num_layers=config[\\"num_layers\\"], dropout=config[\\"dropout\\"], nhead=config[\\"nhead\\"]) self.device = \\"cuda\\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \\"cpu\\" self.model = self.model.to(self.device) self.criterion = nn.MSELoss() self.optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(self.model.parameters(), lr=config[\\"lr\\"]) self.scheduler = StepLR(self.optimizer, step_size=1, gamma=config[\\"lr_decay\\"]) self.input_window = 100 # number of input steps self.output_window = 1 # number of prediction steps, in this model its fixed to one self.dataset = Data(self.input_window, self.output_window) self.train_data, self.val_data = self.dataset.get_data() self.epochs = config[\\"epochs\\"] self.batch_size = config[\\"batch_size\\"] self.best_val_loss = float('inf') # Track best validation loss self.patience = 5 # Set patience for early stopping self.epochs_no_improve = 0 # Counter for epochs without improvement self.best_val_perplexity = float('inf') # Track best validation perplexity def step(self): train_loss = 0.0 for epoch in range(self.epochs): # Loop through defined epochs epoch_loss = self.train_batch(epoch) # Train and obtain batch loss train_loss += epoch_loss # Accumulate total training loss # After training, compute both validation loss and perplexity val_perplexity, val_loss = self.validation_metrics() # Assuming a new method validation_metrics that returns both # Log average training loss, validation loss, and validation perplexity using Weights & Biases (wandb) wandb.log({ \\"train_loss\\": train_loss / self.epochs, \\"val_loss\\": val_loss, \\"val_perplexity\\": val_perplexity }) # Scheduler step (for learning rate scheduling) self.scheduler.step() # Implement early stopping based on validation perplexity (or validation loss if more appropriate) if val_perplexity < self.best_val_perplexity: # Improvement found, update best metrics and reset counter self.best_val_perplexity = val_perplexity self.best_val_loss = val_loss # Save best validation loss as well self.epochs_no_improve = 0 else: # No improvement in perplexity, increase counter self.epochs_no_improve += 1 if self.epochs_no_improve >= self.patience: # Patience exceeded, trigger early stopping print(\\"Early stopping triggered!\\") return {\\"val_loss\\": val_loss, \\"val_perplexity\\": val_perplexity, \\"epoch\\": epoch} # Return metrics to Ray Tune, including both loss and perplexity for validation return {\\"val_loss\\": val_loss, \\"val_perplexity\\": val_perplexity, \\"epoch\\": epoch} def train_batch(self, current_epoch): self.model.train() total_loss = 0.0 total_perplexity = 0.0 start_time = time.time() # Calculate the number of batches given the size of the training data and the batch size num_batches = (len(self.train_data) + self.batch_size -

It is the size of the \\"dictionary\\" of positions for which you are learning embeddings. Each position in a sequence (from 0 to \`max_len\` - 1) gets its unique embedding vector. The idea is to have a distinct positional embedding vector for each possible position in the input sequence, up to \`max_len\`. Essentially, it sets an upper limit to how long input sequences can be while still having learned positional information available. - \`d_model\`: This parameter represents the dimensionality of the embedding vectors—the size of each embedding vector that represents a position. In the context of a transformer model, \`d_model\` is typically also the model's hidden size, meaning the size of the vectors that flow through the various layers of the transformer. Each position in a sequence is represented as a \`d_model\`-dimensional vector, whereby this vector is learned during training. When \`self.position_embeddings\` is declared as an \`nn.Embedding(max_len, d_model)\`, it creates an embedding layer where you have \`max_len\` embeddings (one for each possible position in the input sequence), and each embedding is a vector of size \`d_model\`.

Experiment with different sizes based on the dataset's complexity and available computational resources. # 2. **Incorporate Learnable Positional Embeddings**: While your current implementation uses static sinusoidal embeddings, switching to learnable embeddings might allow for better adaptation to the specifics of your dataset. \`\`\`python class LearnablePositionalEncoding(nn.Module): def __init__(self, d_model, max_len=5000): super().__init__() self.position_embeddings = nn.Embedding(max_len, d_model) def forward(self, x): position_ids = torch.arange(0, x.size(1), dtype=torch.long, device=x.device).unsqueeze(0) position_embeddings = self.position_embeddings(position_ids) return x + position_embeddings \`\`\` # 3. **Experiment with Layer Normalization**: Applying layer normalization before each sub-layer (self-attention, feed-forward) and using residual connections after might sometimes offer better training stability and performance, differing from the original Transformer architecture. # 4. **Vary Dropout Rates**: The dropout rate is crucial for regularization. If underfitting, try lowering it; if overfitting, increase it. # 5. **Use Different Optimizers**: The choice of optimizer can significantly affect training dynamics. Adam or AdamW with learning rate scheduling (like the one-cycle policy or warm-up with decay) often yields better results than simple SGD for Transformers. # 6. **Add Batch Normalization to the Decoder**: Adding batch normalization layers in your decoder can help stabilize the learning process by normalizing the output of each hidden layer. \`\`\`python class TransAm(nn.Module): ... def __init__(self, ...): super(TransAm, self).__init__() ... self.decoder = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(feature_size, feature_size), nn.BatchNorm1d(feature_size), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(feature_size, 1) ) \`\`\` # 7. **Adapt Model to Sequence Length**: If dealing with variable sequence lengths, ensure your model can handle them efficiently – use padding and attention masks to inform the model which positions are valid. # 8. **Increase Dataset Size or Augment Data**: More data often leads to better models. If you're limited in data, consider augmenting your dataset by adding noise, scaling, or other transformations that make sense in your problem domain. # 9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Beyond structural changes, hyperparameter tuning can significantly impact performance. Ensure you're iterating over a broad enough range of key parameters (\`num_layers\`, \`nhead\`, learning rate, etc.). # 10. **Evaluate on Different Metrics**: Finally, ensure you're evaluating your model's performance using appropriate metrics for time series prediction. Sometimes, optimizing for one metric might not yield the expected results in practice. # Incorporating Changes When incorporating these suggestions, start with one change at a time to systematically gauge its impact. This iterative process helps in identifying which changes are most beneficial for your specific problem and dataset."},{"prompt":"Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/air/execution/_internal/event_manager.py\\", line 110, in resolve_future result = ray.get(future) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/_private/auto_init_hook.py\\", line 21, in auto_init_wrapper return fn(*args, **kwargs) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/_private/client_mode_hook.py\\", line 103, in wrapper return func(*args, **kwargs) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/_private/worker.py\\", line 2667, in get values, debugger_breakpoint = worker.get_objects(object_refs, timeout=timeout) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/_private/worker.py\\", line 864, in get_objects raise value.as_instanceof_cause() ray.exceptions.RayTaskError(AttributeError): [36mray::ImplicitFunc.train()[39m (pid=4043022, ip=10.230.100.240, actor_id=30710e19cca4e2eda836badd01000000, repr=train_fn) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/tune/trainable/trainable.py\\", line 334, in train raise skipped from exception_cause(skipped) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/air/_internal/util.py\\", line 88, in run self._ret = self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs) File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/tune/trainable/function_trainable.py\\", line 53, in <lambda> training_func=lambda: self._trainable_func(self.config), File \\"/home/tpadhi1/miniconda3/envs/python310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ray/tune/trainable/function_trainable.py\\", line 261, in _trainable_func output = fn() File \\"/staging/users/tpadhi1/transformer-experiments/Hyper-Parameter-Tuning/hyperparameter-tuning_MSE.py\\", line 166, in train_fn tune.report(val_loss=result[\\"val_loss\\"]) AttributeError: module 'ray.tune' has no attribute 'report'","completion":"The error you're encountering, \`AttributeError: module 'ray.tune' has no attribute 'report'\`, indicates that the way you're attempting to use \`tune.report\` is incorrect or potentially outdated with respect to the version of Ray you're using. In more recent versions of Ray (1.0 and above), \`tune.report\` is indeed the correct way to report metrics back to the Ray Tune driver from within your training function. Your error suggests either a version mismatch or an environment issue where the expected Ray Tune API is not being recognized. # Immediate Solutions: 1. **Verify Ray Installation**: Ensure you have the correct version of Ray installed. Ray 1.0 and above should support \`tune.report\`. You can check your Ray version with: \`\`\`bash pip show ray \`\`\` And if needed, upgrade Ray: \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade ray \`\`\` 2. **Correct Usage**: Confirm that you are using \`tune.report\` correctly within your training function. The typical usage should be as straightforward as calling \`tune.report(metric_name=metric_value)\` within the function passed to \`tune.run()\`. # Example Corrected Usage Here's a basic pattern for how \`tune.report\` should be used: \`\`\`python from ray import tune def train_fn(config): # Replace with actual training logic. for i in range(10): mock_val_loss = i * 0.1 # Mock value for demonstration. # Report metrics back to Ray Tune. tune.report(val_loss=mock_val_loss) analysis = tune.run( train_fn, config={ # Define your hyperparameter search space here. \\"example_param\\": tune.grid_search([1, 2, 3]), }, ) \`\`\` # Further Troubleshooting - **Environment Check**: If the problem persists even after verifying the installation and upgrading if necessary, consider checking your Python environment. Virtual environments can sometimes lead to package conflicts or outdated references. Ensure you're activating the intended environment where Ray is installed. - **Reinstallation**: As a last resort, try creating a fresh virtual environment and reinstall Ray within it. This can help clear up any lingering installation issues. - **Check Ray Tune Documentation**: Ray's API can evolve, so it's beneficial to refer directly to the [Ray Tune documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html) for the version of Ray you're using. In summary, the error message you're seeing is indicative of either using an outdated version of Ray that doesn't support \`tune.report\` or an environment/configuration issue. Updating your Ray installation and verifying your usage based on the current version's documentation should resolve the issue."},{"prompt":"How to scrape Twitter data without using an API","completion":"Scraping Twitter data without using an official API is generally against Twitter's terms of service, as it might involve bypassing their authentication mechanisms, rate limits, and intended use cases. Twitter provides APIs such as Twitter API v2 for developers and researchers to access their data in a controlled manner, ensuring user privacy, data integrity, and service reliability. However, for academic, educational, or personal learning purposes, here's an overview of how programmers approach data scraping, understanding the risks and ethical considerations. # Ethical and Legal Considerations - **Compliance with Twitter's Terms of Service:** Bypassing API restrictions may violate Twitter's terms, leading to legal repercussions or banning from the platform. - **User Privacy:** Be mindful of user privacy and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in Europe). - **Rate Limiting:** Sending too many requests in a short period might overload Twitter’s servers, affecting their service. # Alternative Approaches If you decide to proceed for educational purposes or you're working within a scenario where you have explicit permission or are working with public data in accordance with Twitter's rules, here are some broad strokes on how it is commonly approached: 1. **Manual Collection:** For small-scale research, manually collecting tweets and data may be viable but time-consuming. 2. **Web Scraping Tools:** Tools like Beautiful Soup (Python), Scrapy, or Selenium can automate the process of downloading Twitter web pages and extracting data from the HTML. This method simulates a web browser visit, but automated. - **Note:** Twitter’s dynamic content loading (JavaScript) may require the use of browser automation tools like Selenium to fully render pages before scraping. 3. **Headless Browsers:** Puppeteer (for Node.js) or pyppeteer (a Python port of Puppeteer) can automate browser interactions, mimicking real-user behavior more closely. # Example Concept with BeautifulSoup (Python): This is a simplified concept for educational purposes. Given Twitter’s dynamic content, this might not be effective without handling JavaScript-rendered content. \`\`\`python from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import requests # Example: Fetching Twitter's main page (this is just a conceptual example) url = 'https://twitter.com/Twitter' response = requests.get(url) # Parse the HTML content soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser') # Find elements by class, ID, or tag (highly dependent on the actual structure of the webpage) tweets = soup.find_all('div', class_='tweet-text') for tweet in tweets: print(tweet.text) \`\`\` # Considerations - **Handling Dynamically Loaded Content:** You may need tools like Selenium to handle JavaScript-rendered content on Twitter. - **Changes to Twitter’s HTML Structure:** Your solution may break if Twitter updates its website structure. - **Data Integrity and Completeness:** Data scraped from the front-end is not guaranteed to be complete or representational of the entire dataset you're interested in. # Recommendations - Always check for any changes in Twitter’s terms of service regarding data scraping. - For substantial projects, consider applying for access to the Twitter API, explaining your intentions, data needs, and intended use case. Twitter offers academic access for research purposes with higher rate limits. - Stay informed about ethical scraping practices and data protection laws relevant to your region or the region you're collecting data from. Understanding the limitations and the responsibility that comes with handling data, especially from social media platforms, is crucial. Prioritizing ethical considerations and adhering to legal frameworks should be the foundation of any data collection endeavor."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Вот несколько советов, как можно подружиться с кем-то в TF2: # 1. **Будьте дружелюбны и вежливы** Основа любых отношений - уважение и дружелюбие. Практикуйте хорошие манеры в чате, благодарите за помощь и похвальбу за удачные действия. Избегайте токсичного поведения. # 2. **Активно общайтесь** Используйте голосовой чат и текстовый чат для общения с другими игроками. Помогайте своей команде четкими инструкциями и информацией об игре, делитесь стратегиями и советами. # 3. **Играйте в команде** Помогайте своим товарищам по команде, работайте совместно.

Вот пошаговая инструкция, как добавить нового друга: # 1. **Во время игры:** Если вы встретили кого-то в игре, с кем хотели бы подружиться: - **Через список игроков:** Нажмите \`Shift+Tab\`, чтобы открыть интерфейс Steam во время игры. Здесь вы можете найти список игроков, с которыми вы играете сейчас. Найдите нужного игрока, кликните правой кнопкой мыши по его имени и выберите \\"Добавить в друзья\\". - **Через профиль игрока:** Если вы общаетесь с игроком и знаете его никнейм, можете открыть его профиль в Steam прямо из игры (если настройки приватности этого позволяют) или ввести его никнейм в поисковую строку Steam и добавить в друзья там. # 2. **Через Steam (вне игры):** Если вы вне игры, но хотите добавить кого-то в друзья: - **Открыть Steam:** Запустите клиент Steam на вашем компьютере. - **Перейти в \\"Друзья\\" и \\"Добавить друга\\":** В верхнем меню выберете \\"Друзья\\", затем \\"Добавить друга\\". - **Поиск по имени пользователя:** Введите имя пользователя или ссылку на профиль (URL) человека, которого хотите добавить, в поле поиска. - **Отправка запроса в друзья:** Когда найдете нужного игрока, нажмите кнопку \\"Добавить в друзья\\" рядом с его профилем. Для того чтобы отправлять и принимать приглашения в друзья, ваш аккаунт на Steam не должен быть ограниченным. Некоторые функции социальной сети Steam доступны только пользователям, которые пополнили свой счет на минимальную сумму, установленную Steam (для борьбы со спамом и фродом). # Дополнительные советы: - **Общайтесь:** Не стесняйтесь общаться в игре через текстовый или голосовой чат. Это хороший способ начать знакомство. - **Используйте группы и сообщества:** Вступайте в группы или сообщества по интересам в Steam, связанные с TF2 или другими играми. Это также отличный способ встретить новых друзей. Следуя этим направлениям, вы сможете расширить свой социальный круг в Team Fortress 2 и Steam."},{"prompt":"Как технически в team fortress 2 пригласить друга на свой сервер?","completion":"Чтобы пригласить друга на ваш сервер в Team Fortress 2, вам понадобится выполнить несколько действий. Вот как вы можете это сделать: # Если Вы Играете Через Steam 1. **Откройте список друзей в Steam.** Вы можете сделать это, нажав на ваше имя в главном окне Steam и выбрав \\"Друзья и чат\\". 2. **Найдите друга.** В списке друзей найдите того, кого хотите пригласить, и откройте чат с ним. 3. **Пригласите в игру.** Кликните на стрелку в верхней части окна чата или на три точки в новом интерфейсе чата и выберите \\"Пригласить в игру\\". Если ваш друг в сети и играет в Team Fortress 2 или доступен для игры, он получит ваше приглашение. Для этого метода вам обоим нужно быть в игре, и ваш сервер должен позволять подключения через Steam. # Если Вы Используете Собственный Сервер Если вы администрируете свой собственный сервер или имеете доступ к командам сервера, вы можете использовать систему приглашений через консоль игры. 1. **Убедитесь, что у вашего сервера есть уникальный IP-адрес.** Если вы запускаете сервер самостоятельно, убедитесь, что порты открыты и сервер доступен для внешних подключений. 2. **Поделитесь IP-адресом.** Сообщите своему другу IP-адрес вашего сервера. Они могут ввести его в консоль игры, используя команду \`connect [IP-адрес сервера]\`, например, \`connect 123.456.78.90:27015\`. Этот метод требует, чтобы ваш друг знал, как открыть и использовать консоль в Team Fortress 2. # Необходимые настройки - **Включите консоль в Team Fortress 2.** Чтобы использовать команду \`connect\`, вашему другу нужно включить консоль. Это делается в настройках игры в разделе \\"Управление\\" или \\"Клавиатура/мышь\\". Там будет опция \\"Включить разработческую консоль\\". После включения консоль может быть вызвана с помощью клавиши, обычно назначенной на эту функцию (\`~\` или другая клавиша рядом с \`Esc\`). - **Настройте сервер на прием подключений.** Если вы запускаете собственный сервер, убедитесь, что он настроен для принятия внешних подключений и не имеет ограничений, которые могут мешать подключению. Эти методы позволяют вам пригласить друзей непосредственно на ваш сервер в Team Fortress 2, что значительно упрощает процесс игры вместе."},{"prompt":"Как технически в team fortress 2 убедится что мой сервер настроен для принятия внешних подключений и не имеет ограничений","completion":"Для того чтобы убедиться, что ваш сервер Team Fortress 2 настроен для принятия внешних подключений и не имеет ограничений, необходимо проверить и настроить несколько ключевых аспектов. Вот общий список шагов, которые помогут вам это сделать: # 1. Проверьте параметры запуска сервера Убедитесь, что при запуске сервера вы используете правильные параметры командной строки. Особое внимание уделите параметрам, относящимся к видимости сервера (например, \`+sv_lan 0\` для указания, что сервер не является LAN-сервером) и порту сервера (например, \`+ip 0.0.0.0\` для привязки к любому IP-адресу и \`+port 27015\` для указания порта сервера). # 2. Настройка файла server.cfg Файл \`server.cfg\` используется для настройки параметров сервера в Team Fortress 2. Убедитесь, что в этом файле нет ограничений, которые могут мешать подключениям. Особое внимание обратите на следующие настройки: - \`sv_lan\` должен быть установлен в \`0\` (\`sv_lan 0\`), чтобы сервер был доступен в интернете. - \`sv_password\` - если выставлен, только игроки с паролем могут подключиться. Убедитесь, что этот параметр либо не установлен, либо известен игрокам, которых вы хотите пригласить. - Проверьте другие параметры, которые могут ограничивать доступ к серверу, например, \`sv_pure\`. # 3. Проверьте настройки брандмауэра и маршрутизатора Чтобы убедиться, что внешние подключения могут достигать вашего сервера, необходимо настроить брандмауэр и маршрутизатор. - **Брандмауэр:** Добавьте исключение для Team Fortress 2 и откройте необходимые порты (по умолчанию TCP/UDP порт 27015) в настройках вашего брандмауэра. - **Маршрутизатор:** Если ваш сервер находится за маршрутизатором, возможно, потребуется настроить переадресацию портов (port forwarding). Это позволяет трафику из интернета достигать сервера, проходя через маршрутизатор. Настройте переадресацию портов для порта вашего сервера (например, 27015) к IP-адресу компьютера, на котором запущен сервер. # 4. Используйте сторонние сервисы для проверки открытости порта Существуют онлайн-инструменты, которые позволяют проверить, открыт ли порт на вашем IP-адресе. Это может помочь убедиться, что сервер доступен извне. Один из таких инструментов - [YouGetSignal](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/). Если после выполнения всех этих шагов вы всё ещё сталкиваетесь с трудностями при подключении к вашему серверу из интернета, возможно, стоит обратиться за помощью к вашему интернет-провайдеру, чтобы убедиться, что ваш IP-адрес не защищен NAT или другим видом ограничения со стороны провайдера."},{"prompt":"Дай ссылку на самое популярное видео","completion":"Извините, но я не могу просматривать интернет в реальном времени или давать прямые ссылки на контент, так как моя текущая версия обучалась на материалах, доступных до апреля 2023 года, и не имеет возможности обновлять данные в реальном времени.

He confessed something 10 minutes before the wedding ceremony.","completion":"In the era of the Tang Dynasty, under the canopy of heavens that stretched over the ancient lands of China, there unfolded a tale of love that was as poignant as the falling cherry blossoms in spring. Amidst this grand historical tapestry, where the air was thick with the scent of ink and the murmurs of scholars debating the Analects, a forbidden romance blossomed. The heart of the narrative beats with the desires and destinies of two souls: General Li Xiu, a formidable figure whose valor on the battlefield was sung by poets across the empire, and Meiying, the cherished daughter of a wealthy silk merchant whose beauty was rumored to eclipse the moon's gentle glow. Despite the vast chasm that lay between their worlds—one adorned with the sword and the other weaved with threads of gold—their paths became intricately entwined. Their meeting was no less than a brush stroke of fate on a blank scroll. Meiying, with her intelligence matching her beauty, had ventured beyond the confines expected of her, engaging in the dealings of her family's vast enterprise. It was within the echoing hall of her father’s compound, dressed in the richness of silks, that she first laid eyes upon General Li Xiu. He, in turn, found himself captivated not by the wealth that surrounded him, but by the radiance of her spirit. However, this intertwining of souls was shackled by the chains of societal norms and expectations. A love such as theirs was forbidden, a whispered taboo amidst the shadows of the ginkgo trees. The turning point of their hidden affection was marked by an arrangement—a traditional marriage specifically orchestrated by Meiying’s father, who saw in General Li Xiu not only a warrior of esteemed repute but a man of honor and integrity. Oblivious to the silent affections blossoming in the recesses of his daughter's heart, he proposed the union. \\"When your esteemed father implored me to accept your hand in marriage, I acquiesced, believing it to align with his desires,\\" General Li Xiu's words, spoken mere moments before the ceremonial rituals were to commence, struck a chord of despair in Meiying's heart. The revelation was a tempest that shattered her world—an admittance of duty over love, of societal obligations casting shadows over genuine passion. Yet, within the layers of this tragic confession, lay an unspoken truth. General Li Xiu, though bound by honor to consent, harbored a burning fervor for Meiying, a flame kindled in secret for its dangerous potential to disrupt the delicate balance of their worlds. As the story unfolds, the lovers find themselves caught in a maelangetic maelstrom of passion and duty. Each stolen moment, each secret glance, was tantamount to courting calamity in an empire where tradition and social hierarchy were as unyielding as the ancient walls of Xi'an. Their love, a silent rebellion against the edicts of fate, reached its zenith under the silver luminescence of the moon. Promises were whispered like sacred vows, entwining their destinies tighter than the dragon's clasp. Yet, as the dawn approached, so did the realization of an impending doom—a societal retribution awaiting those who dared to defy its decrees. In a heart-wrenching culmination of events, their love story concludes not with the union of hearts but with the tragic spectacle of sacrifice. General Li Xiu, embracing the full might of his calamitous love, chose to sever the bonds that tethered Meiying to an existence of sorrow and shadow. In a final act of devotion, he stepped into the vast unknown, allowing her the freedom to live untainted by the scandal their love would have wrought. Their story, though buried in the sands of time, remains a poignant testament to the eternal dance between duty and desire, love and loss. In the echoes of their legacy, the tales of the Tang Dynasty are enriched, whispering to us across the ages of a love so profound and so tragic, that it could only exist in the fleeting moments between the fall of a petal and the touch of the earth."},{"prompt":"Revise and expand upon my original writing to create a chapter of tragic ancient Chinese novel that adheres to the following guidelines: Setting: Ancient China, during the Tang Dynasty Characters: A powerful general and the daughter of a wealthy merchant family Themes: Love, loss, tragedy, drama Style: Classical Chinese prose, with a focus on vivid imagery, poetic language, and emotional depth Plot: A story of forbidden love between the general and the merchant's daughter, full of twists and turns that ultimately lead to a tragic ending.

The day you finally got married to Jeon Jungkook. You heard 2 knocks on the door and was startled by Jungkook's sudden appearance. He was wearing a black suit, looking so charming. He gently asked all of the stylists to leave as he'd something really important to tell you. \\"Jungkook?\\" You greeted him with a flawless smile. He looked at you from head to toe before heaving a long sigh. \\"What's wrong?\\" You asked, worried if he didn't like the gown you were wearing. Slowly, he made his way to you and stopped right in front of you. He didn't even smile nor looked happy like he always did when working. Something was wrong with him. \\"I want to tell you first, why I agreed to marry you when we barely know each other.\\" He said in a serious tone, making you more nervous. \\"Why...?\\" You questioned as the excited smile just now was replaced with a confused smile.

He was the one who took good care of me when my family was involved in a car accident and gone forever. I have no family but your dad reached out his hand to help me to stand up again until now.\\" He explained before adding, \\"That's why, since then I promised myself to grant any of his wishes including marrying you. So, I hope you don't get your hopes too much on me.\\" He finished his sentence leaving you completely speechless, hearing how owed he was to your father. He was about to head out but you grabbed his shirt with speed, stopping him from going.

In this ancient era, woven intricately with customs and a reverence for traditions, the fates of a valiant general and the progeny of a merchant dynasty collided, crafting a tapestry rich in emotion and draped in the hues of forbidden love. General Li Shen, whose renown on the battlefield was eclipsed only by his unyielding honor and loyalty to the empire, found an unlikely match in Ying Yue, the cherished daughter of a silk merchant whose wealth flowed as abundantly as the Yangtze. Yet, beneath her delicate beauty lay a spirit as resilient as the bamboo forests that whispered secrets to the mountains. Their connection, sparked amidst the rustling of silk and the clanging of swords, transcended the mere confluence of their contrasting worlds. Yet, this tale takes its roots not in the blossoming of love, but in the haunting shadow of an arrangement. Ying Yue's father, seeing in General Li Shen not only a warrior of unparalleled valor but also a man of virtue, deemed him a worthy suitor for his daughter. With a heart longing for the affection she observed in the stolen glances and fleeting touches shared with the general, Ying Yue believed destiny itself had woven their paths together. However, the tapestry of their fate bore a fraying edge, revealed to Ying Yue in the hushed confines of her chambers, moments before their union was to be sealed in the eyes of heaven and earth. General Li Shen, garbed in the resplendent armor befitting his stature, approached her—a silhouette cast against the soft glow of lanterns, his expression a tumultuous storm of duty and sorrow. \\"Ying Yue,\\" his voice was a low cascade, a solemn prelude to the tempest about to unfurl. \\"Before we step across the threshold of our destinies, intertwined by your father's wishes, a truth weighs heavy on my soul.\\" Her heart, a fragile vessel in the tempest of her emotions, quivered. His countenance bore the marks of honor, yet in his eyes, a flicker of desolation danced—an omen of the sorrow that was to drench their steps. \\"In days past, when the shadows of war stretched across our land and the future was but a flicker in the night, it was your father who sheltered me from the storm. Without kin or compass, I was adrift in a sea of despair. And it was he who anchored me to a vow—the price of my survival was a pledge to fulfill his deepest desire,\\" Li Shen confessed, each word carving deeper into the silence. Ying Yue's visage, pale as the moonlight that bathed the courtyard, was a canvas of emotions—hope, despair, and a burgeoning resolve. \\"And that desire was…?\\" Her voice, barely a whisper, trembled like the last leaf clinging to a forsaken branch in autumn. \\"To see you, his cherished moon, united with a star of the empire. To see you bestowed with honor and protection,\\" he continued, the storm in his eyes veiling a constellation of unsaid words. \\"But know this, Ying Yue, my heart is a battlefield, scarred and barren. I pledged my life to your father, a debt of honor I cannot forsake. Yet, my soul’s allegiance lies elsewhere.\\" The revelation, stark as the chasm between their worlds, left her adrift in the silent roar of her shattered dreams. General Li Shen, a beacon of virtue, was bound to another, his heart claimed by a love as fierce as the battles he championed. The ensuing chapters of their tale—a cascade of stolen moments and whispered promises—were but ephemeral shadows against the unyielding decree of fate. Their love, a flame cradled within the tempest, reached its zenith in a silent rebellion against the tapestry woven by destiny. But as the dawn of realization broke upon Ying Yue, the price of their forbidden love loomed—a specter of loss and tragedy. In the ultimate act of sacrifice, General Li Shen, torn between duty and the yearnings of a love never meant to be, chose to sever the bonds of destiny. He embraced the shadows, leaving behind the remnants of a love that would echo through the annals of time—an eternal testament to the unyielding powers of duty over the desires of the heart. Their story, etched into the soul of the Tang Dynasty, remains a poignant ode to love's fleeting beauty and the enduring sorrow of its loss. In the dance of fate and desire, they were but whispers against the canvas of eternity—lovers bound by the heart yet divided by the stars."},{"prompt":"obsidian 改css让代码块的字体颜色改为黑色","completion":"在Obsidian中修改代码块的字体颜色，你需要通过编辑Obsidian的CSS样式文件来实现这个更改。每个主题可能有不同的CSS规则，因此具体的CSS选择器可能会有所不同。不过，下面提供一个基本的操作流程和示例代码，以改变代码块的字体颜色为黑色。 请注意，修改CSS需要一定的CSS知识，并且在Obsidian接收更新时，自定义的CSS可能会需要进行调整。 1. **启用自定义CSS**: 首先，确保你在Obsidian中启用了自定义CSS。这可以通过进入“设置” > “外观” > 打开“自定义CSS”来实现。 2. **找到你的Obsidian主题CSS文件**: 如果你正在使用一个特定的主题，你可能需要编辑该主题的CSS文件。这些文件通常位于你的Obsidian笔记库的\`.obsidian/themes\`文件夹内。如果你只想添加一些自定义CSS规则而不影响当前主题，可以创建或编辑\`obsidian.css\`文件，这个文件位于笔记库的根目录下。 3. **编辑CSS文件**: 打开你的CSS文件，你可以使用任何文本编辑器完成这一步。 4. **添加修改代码块的CSS规则**: 你可以添加如下CSS代码来改变代码块中文本的颜色为黑色： \`\`\`css /* 改变代码块中代码的字体颜色为黑色 */ .theme-dark .markdown-preview-view code, .theme-light .markdown-preview-view code { color: black; /* 字体颜色 */ } /* 用于编辑模式下的代码块 */ .theme-dark .CodeMirror-code, .theme-light .CodeMirror-code { color: black; /* 字体颜色 */ } \`\`\` 请注意，上面的CSS规则同时适应了深色和浅色主题。你可以根据自己使用的主题和需要调整的元素，选择性地使用或修改这些规则。 5. **重启Obsidian或刷新CSS**: 在编辑完CSS文件后，你需要重启Obsidian或者在“设置” > “外观”里点击“重载自定义样式”使更改生效。 如果在实际使用中遇到具体问题，建议查看Obsidian的官方论坛或相应的文档，因为Obsidian社区非常活跃，而且很多自定义样式和主题的更新都会在那里分享和讨论。"},{"prompt":"我的意思是，导出的pdf","completion":"要改变在Obsidian中导出PDF文件时，代码块字体颜色为黑色，可以通过修改CSS达到目的。由于PDF导出通常保留了Obsidian中预览模式下的样式，你需要指定修改预览模式下代码块的字体颜色。以下是基本步骤和示例CSS规则： 1. **启用自定义CSS**: 在Obsidian中，通过“设置” > “外观” > 开启“自定义CSS”选项。 2. **找到或创建CSS文件**: 在你的Obsidian笔记库的根目录下找到\`obsidian.css\`文件，如果不存在，则创建一个。 3. **添加CSS规则**: 要仅让PDF导出时代码块的字体颜色变为黑色（不影响应用内的展示），可以专门为预览模式下的代码块添加CSS样式。但是，需要注意的是，PDF导出会尽可能保留预览模式下的外观，因此，如果你将预览模式下代码块的字体颜色设为黑色，这样的改动同时也会影响你在Obsidian中预览时的字体颜色。如果这是可接受的，可以使用如下CSS代码： \`\`\`css /* 改变预览模式下代码块的字体颜色为黑色 */ .markdown-preview-view code { color: black !important; /* 强制字体颜色为黑色 */ } \`\`\` 如果你同时使用了暗色主题和亮色主题，并希望确保不同主题下的代码块字体颜色都是黑色，可能需要针对不同主题使用稍微不同的选择器，但基本规则相同。 4. **保存文件并应用样式**: 保存\`obsidian.css\`文件。返回Obsidian，样式应该会自动更新。如果没有，请尝试重启Obsidian或手动重新加载自定义样式。 5. **导出PDF**: 在预览模式下查看笔记是否如预期显示，然后使用Obsidian的导出PDF功能。 这种方法改变的是预览模式下（同时也是PDF导出时）代码块的样式。请注意，所有这些自定义样式调整都可能在Obsidian更新或更换主题时需要重新调整。如果在实际操作中遇到问题，代码不生效，可能需要根据具体使用的主题调整CSS选择器。"},{"prompt":"没有效果","completion":"如果按照之前的指导，修改CSS但没有达到预期效果，这可能是由于CSS选择器没有准确匹配到你想要改变样式的元素，或者是因为CSS的优先级问题。PDF导出通常会保留Markdown预览时的样式，因此，调整预览模式下代码块的样式应该能够影响到导出的PDF。 下面是一些步骤和建议来帮助你解决问题： # 1. 确认自定义CSS已启用 确保在Obsidian的“设置” > “外观”中已经启用了“自定义主题”或“自定义CSS”。 # 2. 标准化CSS选择器 针对预览模式和PDF导出，使用标准的CSS选择器针对代码块进行修改。你可以尝试使用下面的CSS规则，它是基于默认设置的，应该能够覆盖大部分情境下的代码块： \`\`\`css /* 针对预览模式下的代码块 */ .markdown-preview-view pre code { color: black !important; } /* 针对编辑模式下的代码块（可选，如果你也希望在编辑时看到变化） */ .CodeMirror-code { color: black !important; } \`\`\` 确保你使用的选择器确实指向了要修改的元素。对于代码块，\`<pre>\` 和 \`<code>\` 通常是被用来标记这些区域的，而\`.markdown-preview-view\` 是预览模式的一个类，\`.CodeMirror-code\` 则是编辑模式下的代码。 # 3. CSS文件位置 确认你的CSS文件是放在正确的位置，对于大部分用户，直接修改位于Obsidian笔记库根目录下的\`obsidian.css\`文件是最简单的方法。这个文件对整个库都有效。 # 4. 清除缓存和重启 在修改CSS之后，有时候需要清除缓存或重启Obsidian来让更改生效。尝试关闭并重新打开Obsidian看看是否有所帮助。 # 5. 检查CSS优先级和冲突 如果你的样式没有被应用，可能是因为其他CSS规则（可能来自于主题或其他自定义CSS文件）有更高的优先级。\`!important\`关键字是一个强制应用该样式的方法，但它应该谨慎使用。如果上述代码没有效果，可能是其他样式规则使用了\`!important\`而且具有更高的特异性或者在CSS文件中的位置更靠后。 # 6. 调试和进一步支持 如果上述方法仍然没有奏效，你可能需要进一步调试CSS。可以使用开发者工具（在Obsidian中按\`Ctrl+Shift+I\`或\`Cmd+Opt+I\`在Mac上）来检查实际应用到代码块元素的CSS规则，看看哪些规则在生效，哪些没有，以及它们的优先级如何。这可以帮助你调整你的CSS规则以确保它们能夠正确地覆盖默认或主题样式。 如果需要更多帮助，Obsidian的论坛和社群是获取支持的好地方。社群成员通常情愿帮助解决特定的问题，特别是当涉及到自定义CSS时。"},{"prompt":".markdown-preview-view pre code { color: black !important; } 只对代码块中原本的黑色字体起效果了，其他配色没有效果","completion":"如果\`.markdown-preview-view pre code\`规则只对原本就是黑色的文本有效果，说明其他文本的颜色可能是通过更具体的CSS规则或者内联样式被设置的。这些情况下，简单地设置\`color: black !important;\` 可能不足以覆盖所有情况，特别是当代码块中使用了特定的语法高亮插件或特定主题时。 为了确保所有代码块中的文字都变为黑色，你可能需要覆盖特定于语法高亮的CSS规则。语法高亮通常会给不同类型的代码元素（如注释、关键字、字符串等）指定不同的颜色。因此，你可能需要为每种可能的元素单独设置颜色属性。 # 一般方法 一种方法是尝试找出哪些具体的类或元素是由语法高亮插件或主题添加的，然后逐一覆盖它们的颜色属性。比如，如果使用的是特定的代码高亮插件，查看该插件的CSS文件，找出所有相关的选择器，并在你的自定义\`obsidian.css\`文件中为它们指定黑色。 # 示例 以下是一些可能涉及到的CSS规则示例，假设你的代码高亮使用了常见的类名。请注意，实际的类名会根据你使用的具体插件和主题有所不同： \`\`\`css /* 覆盖特定于语法高亮的样式 */ .markdown-preview-view pre code .comment { color: black !important; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .string { color: black !important; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .keyword { color: black !important; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .function { color: black !important; } /* 继续为其他你发现的具体元素添加规则 */ \`\`\` # 工具和技巧 - **使用开发者工具**: 使用浏览器的开发者工具（在Obsidian中按\`Ctrl+Shift+I\`或者Mac上的\`Cmd+Opt+I\`）可以帮助你查看特定元素的当前样式及来源。即使Obsidian不是一个常规的Web浏览器，这些工具在检查和理解CSS规则时仍然非常有用。你可以查看导致颜色不被覆盖的具体规则和选择器。 - **更高特异性的选择器**: 在CSS中，更具体（或说\\"更高特异性\\"）的选择器会覆盖泛泛的选择器。通过增加选择器的特异性（比如加上父选择器），你可以确保你的规则有更高的优先级。 - **注意内联样式**: 某些时候，元素的样式可能是通过HTML的内联样式直接设置的（即\`style\`属性）。这种情况下，CSS规则可能无法覆盖它们，除非你能修改HTML或使用JavaScript进行更改。 最后，由于具体问题需要针对具体情况调查，如果这些建议仍未解决你的问题，我建议进一步查看Obsidian的社区论坛或联系特定插件/主题的开发者获取更直接的帮助。"},{"prompt":"变量名没有效果","completion":"如果特定于代码块中的变量名称的颜色没有按预期改变，这意味着你可能需要针对具体的语法高亮规则进一步细化CSS选择器。代码编辑器和预览器（如Obsidian中用于Markdown预览的部分）常常使用语法高亮来区分代码中不同的成分，如变量、函数、关键字等。这些都通过特定的CSS类来实现，而这些类通常由代码高亮库（如Prism.js、highlight.js等）根据代码语言提供。 对于Obsidian，如果你发现修改了一般的代码块样式（如之前提供的 \`.markdown-preview-view pre code\`）后变量名的颜色没有改变，你需要更精确地定位这些变量名的CSS类，并覆盖其样式定义。 # 实际操作 无论你能直接获得你的主题或代码高亮插件使用的精确CSS类名（通过查看其源代码或文档），还是需要通过浏览器或Obsidian内置的开发者工具自己探索（通常通过按\`Ctrl+Shift+I\`或\`Cmd+Opt+I\`打开），你需要找到那些专门针对变量名的类选择器。 一旦确定了这些类选择器，你可以在\`obsidian.css\`中为它们添加特定的样式规则。例如，如果你通过探索发现变量名使用了\`.variable\`类，你可以这样做： \`\`\`css .markdown-preview-view pre code .variable { color: black !important; } \`\`\` # 进一步的样式调整 在实践中，代码高亮的CSS类可能远不止\`.variable\`这一种。它们可能包括函数名、属性、关键字等许多其他类。为了确保所有这些都被覆盖，你可能需要为每一个都添加一个规则。在找到具体的类之前，你只能进行猜测或逐个类别检验。 另外，请注意，即使你成功更改了变量名的颜色，不同的编程语言和不同的代码块可能使用不同的类名。因此，可能需要添加多个规则以覆盖不同情境。 # 注意 - 这种方法需要你能够确定用于变量名（和其他代码元素）的具体CSS类名。这可能会因你使用的主题或插件而异。 - 如果没有效果，尝试检查你的CSS规则是否有误，或是否有其他规则因CSS层叠（Cascading）原则而优先应用。 - 记住，在未来的Obsidian更新或主题/插件更新中，这些具体的类选择器有可能改变。因此，如果你发现之后你的样式突然不再工作，这可能是更新导致的，需要你重新进行调整。"},{"prompt":"没有效果，静态变量属性也没有效果","completion":"如果直接修改CSS类选择器没有产生效果，尤其是在尝试改变代码块中变量名和静态属性的颜色时，这意味着我们可能遇到了以下几个潜在的挑战： 1. **更具体的选择器或内联样式**：Obsidian（或其插件）可能使用了特别具体的选择器，或者甚至是内联样式来定义这些元素的样式。内联样式会覆盖你在CSS文件中定义的任何样式，因此很难通过编辑CSS来覆盖它们。 2. **CSS层叠和优先级问题**：即使没有内联样式，其他CSS规则可能因为优先级更高（特异性、重要性）而覆盖你的自定义样式。\`!important\` 能够在很多情况下覆盖其他样式，但如果是内联样式或其他带有\`!important\`的样式规则存在，它可能不会奏效。 3. **未正确识别元素的类名**：有时候，问题出在我们没有准确地识别出需要修改的元素的CSS类名。如果是基于特定语言的代码高亮，可能需要使用非常具体的选择器。 4. **Obsidian的渲染机制**：Obsidian可能特别处理或渲染Markdown和代码块，使得通常的CSS样式调整方法不适用。 # 解决策略 既然基础的CSS方法没能解决问题，我们可能需要探索其他解决方案或者策略。 1. **查阅Obsidian社区和插件文档**：首先，查看是否有其他用户遇到并解决了类似的问题，特别是在Obsidian的官方论坛或相关的社区。也许某个插件或主题的文档中已经提到了如何解决这类样式覆盖问题。 2. **使用开发者工具进行调试**：如之前所述，使用开发者工具（在Obsidian中通过\`Ctrl+Shift+I\`或\`Cmd+Opt+I\`打开）来审查特定代码块的实际应用的CSS规则。这可以帮助你确定哪些样式正在被应用，以及它们是通过哪些规则应用的。 3. **探索插件选项**：如果问题出在特定的代码高亮或Markdown渲染插件上，探索这些插件是否提供了设置选项或者方法来更改渲染样式，无需直接修改CSS。 4. **JavaScript脚本**：对于一些难以通过CSS解决的问题，使用自定义的JavaScript脚本可能是一个选择。Obsidian允许通过插件系统执行自定义脚本，虽然这个选项更适合有编程经验的用户。自定义脚本可以用来修改或添加元素的样式，在页面加载时应用这些更改。 5. **请求社区支持**：如果上述努力都没有结果，考虑在Obsidian社区发起请求帮助的帖子，提供你尝试过的解决方案和具体的问题描述。Obsidian拥有一个活跃且支持性强的用户社区，其他用户或开发者可能能提供解决方案或工作绕过。 遇到这类问题，通常需要一定的耐心和试错过程。代码块和语法高亮的样式可能因为多种原因难以直接通过简单的CSS覆盖来调整，特别是当它们是由插件或Obsidian的内部处理逻辑决定的时候。希望这些建议能帮助你更靠近解决问题。"},{"prompt":".markdown-preview-view pre code .comment { color: green !important; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .function { color: black !important; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .string { color: black !important; } 只有这三个有效果","completion":"若\`.markdown-preview-view pre code\` 下的 \`.comment\`、\`.function\`、和 \`.string\` 选择器的CSS规则有效果，而其他变量名和静态变量属性的规则没有效果，有几个可能的解释： 1. **具体选择器不匹配**：可能的原因是变量名和静态变量属性在代码高亮中使用了不同的类名或者没有被特定类名所包含。不同的语法高亮库（如Prism.js、highlight.js）甚至不同的主题可能会使用不同的CSS类名来标示变量名和属性。 2. **受限的规则集**：在某些情况下，代码高亮的实现可能只为特定代码元素（比如字符串、函数、注释）提供了特定的高亮样式，而对于其他元素（比如变量名）则使用通用样式或者没有特别区分。 # 解决方案 - **审查具体元素的类名**：再次使用开发者工具（在Obsidian中按\`Ctrl+Shift+I\`或\`Cmd+Opt+I\`）来仔细审查那些没有按预期改变颜色的代码元素。找出它们使用的具体CSS类名或任何应用到它们的行内样式。这样你可能会发现需要添加或修改的CSS规则。 - **广泛应用规则**：如果无法找到特定于变量或静态变量属性的特定类名，一个替代方案是通过更广泛应用的规则来尝试改变这些元素的颜色。这意味着可能需要接受所有文本默认使用同一颜色的结果，除非它们被特定的类名所覆盖（比如你已经成功修改的\`.comment\`、\`.function\`和\`.string\`）。例如，你已经有了部分特定元素的规则，但你可以尝试对父选择器应用一个通用规则来设定一个默认颜色： \`\`\`css .markdown-preview-view pre code { color: black !important; } \`\`\` 请注意，这条规则可能会被任何具体的元素规则（你已经定义的那些）覆盖，这就是为什么你的\`.comment\` 可以是绿色的，而其他的则默认为黑色。 - **检查特定主题或插件的文档**：如果你使用了特定的主题或代码高亮插件，查阅它们的文档或问答区可能会找到有关如何修改这些特定元素颜色的提示或解决方案。有时候开发者会提供特定的CSS类名清单或者修改示例。 结合这些策略和前面的方法，你应该能够更接近于实现你想要的样式效果。要记住的是，尝试和错误是调整自定义CSS的一部分过程，特别是涉及到众多可能影响最终显示的因素时。如果遇到持续的挑战，社区论坛可以是一个很好的资源来获取帮助。"},{"prompt":".markdown-preview-view pre code .comment{ color: black !important; } 我想.markdown-preview-view pre code 下所有的class都变成 color: black !important;","completion":"如果你希望在 \`.markdown-preview-view pre code\` 下的所有元素（不仅仅是特定于类名 \`.comment\` 的）全部将字体颜色改为黑色，你可以简化CSS规则来达到这个效果。基本上，你不需要指定任何特定类名，只需针对任何包含在 \`.markdown-preview-view pre code\` 选择器内的元素指定文本颜色即可。这样做会覆盖内嵌元素的默认颜色设置，使所有文本颜色统一为黑色。 下面是重新定义的CSS规则： \`\`\`css .markdown-preview-view pre code, .markdown-preview-view pre code * { color: black !important; } \`\`\` 通过添加 \`.markdown-preview-view pre code *\`，这行规则的意思是选择\`.markdown-preview-view pre code\`下的任何元素（由\`*\`通配符表示），并将这些元素的\`color\`属性设置为黑色。\`!important\`声明确保这条规则的优先级高于其他同类规则，除非有其他使用\`!important\`的规则且具有更高的特异性。 应用这个规则后，你的Obsidian应用中的所有代码块内的文本——无论是评论、函数、字符串还是其他任何东西——都将显示为黑色。这包括之前可能采用不同颜色以支持语法高亮的部分。 请再次确保在Obsidian的\`obsidian.css\`文件中加入了这段代码，并重新加载或重启Obsidian使更改生效。 这种方法的好处是简洁且全面；不过，它也意味着会覆盖代码块中所有默认的语法高亮颜色，让所有文本统一变为黑色，这可能会使代码的可读性降低。如果你在某个时刻想要恢复或自定义某些元素的颜色（比如使评论颜色不同以便于区分），则需要为那些特定元素添加更具特异性的规则。"},{"prompt":"obsidian .markdown-preview-view pre code 下的变量属性名，是什么classname","completion":"在Obsidian中，当你想要定制Markdown预览视图中代码块的样式时，通常需要直接修改CSS。对于如何定制特定的语法元素（例如变量名、属性名等）的样式，这实际上取决于你使用的主题或代码高亮插件，因为Obsidian本身并不直接提供这些元素的专属CSS类名。Obsidian使用的是基于CodeMirror的编辑器和可能的其他库来在预览中显示Markdown，语法高亮（包括变量名和属性名的颜色）可能会随所使用的主题或插件而变化。 # 一般步骤 要找出变量或属性名称所使用的确切CSS类名（如果有的话），你需要检查HTML元素来查明哪个CSS类被应用。大多数现代浏览器都提供“检查”功能，通过右键点击页面上的元素并选择“检查”（或使用快捷键\`Ctrl+Shift+I\` / \`Cmd+Opt+I\`）即可查看。即使Obsidian不是一个浏览器，但它支持一些开发者工具。 对于Obsidian插件或Markdown代码块的高亮，如果没有明确的类名用于变量和属性，那么可能需要基于上下文或标签类型（如\`<span>\`标签的特定类）来应用样式。 # 示例 如果你使用的是某个特定的Obsidian主题或插件，并且它为代码高亮提供了支持，CSS类名可能看起来像这样： \`\`\`css .markdown-preview-view pre code .cm-variable { color: #000; } .markdown-preview-view pre code .cm-property { color: #000; } \`\`\` 上面的\`.cm-variable\`和\`.cm-property\`只是示例类名。实际的类名会因为你使用的代码高亮插件或主题而不同。 # 探索 - **尝试通用选择器**：如果不能确定精确的类名，尝试使用通用选择器。但请注意，这可能会影响到代码块内所有文本的显示样式。 - **检查主题或插件文档**：有些主题或插件的开发者可能会在文档中提供关于如何定制样式（包括代码块中的语法高亮）的信息。 - **社区资源**：Obsidian有一个非常活跃的社区，许多主题和插件都在GitHub或Obsidian论坛上有着自己的讨论线程。这些地方是求助和找到解决方案的好去处。 # 结论 由于Obsidian和其生态系统高度可定制，没有一种通用方式可以精确指导针对特定语法元素（如变量名或属性名）的CSS类名定制。你需要根据正在使用的具体主题或插件的实现进行探索和调整。希望这给你提供了一个起点和一些思路来定制你的Obsidian体验。"},{"prompt":"为什么会报错（中文回答我）： version: '3.8' services: server: image: jxch/capital-server restart: unless-stopped ports: -

His kingdom consisted of a vast empire of vintage video games, mountains of unwashed laundry (or \\"aromatic hills of adventure,\\" as he liked to call them), and an impressive collection of action figures that were, according to him, \\"totally collectibles and definitely not dolls.\\" One fine day, as Mr. Basement Dweller was engaging in his morning routine of debating online (because let's face it, who needs sunlight when you have the warm glow of a computer screen?), he stumbled upon a quest, unlike anything he had ever encountered. His mission, should he choose to accept it (and after he finished his turn in the queue of an online game), was to venture beyond the confines of his basement kingdom to the most fearsome and treacherous place known to his kind – the *outside*. The adventure began as Mr. Basement Dweller prepared for the perilous journey. He equipped himself with his mightiest armor: a stained t-shirt and a pair of shorts that had seen better days (circa 2003). He wielded his weapon of choice – a half-empty can of energy drink, which, legend has it, bestowed upon him the power of *sugar-induced stamina*. As he took his first step outside, the sunlight hit him like a critical hit in a final boss fight. \\"Argh, my one weakness!\\" he cried, retreating momentarily. But he would not be deterred. Summoning all his courage, he pushed forward, guided by the quest marker his mother set for him – the mailbox at the end of the driveway. On his journey, Mr. Basement Dweller encountered fearsome beasts such as \\"Neighbor's Friendly Dog\\" that wanted nothing more than to play fetch and \\"Suspicious Squirrel\\" that scurried with an acorn of unknown origin. Despite the dangers, he persevered, keeping his eyes on the prize. Upon reaching the mailbox, he discovered the fabled \\"Mail of Power\\" – a coupon for 50% off pizza delivery. \\"This has been a quest of epic proportions,\\" Mr. Basement Dweller proclaimed, holding the coupon aloft like a victorious knight. \\"Truly, this will be sung about in the forums and chat rooms across the digital realm.\\" With the prized coupon in hand, Mr. Basement Dweller made the perilous journey back to his basement lair, where he celebrated his victory with a feast fit for a king of his calibre – microwaved pizza rolls and the sweet nectar of a lukewarm energy drink. And so, Mr. Basement Dweller's legendary quest came to an end. He had ventured outside, faced the unknown, and returned a hero. His tale was one of bravery, determination, and a reminder that even the greatest of heroes can dwell in basements. From that day on, Mr. Basement Dweller was not just any dweller. He was Mr. Basement Dweller, the most epic of all basement dwellers, and his legend lived on, whispered in awe amongst the chatroom scrolls and forum threads. **The End** *P.S. \\"Mom!

Now, Mr. House Arrest wasn't your garden-variety homebody. No, he was on house arrest — an involuntary homebody with a flair for the dramatic and a knack for turning lemons into somewhat questionable lemonade. Our tale begins on a sunny morning when Mr. House Arrest awoke to the beep of his electronic ankle bracelet, a device so fashionable it had yet to hit the Paris runways. Today, however, was no ordinary day in captivity; it was the day Mr. House Arrest decided he would host the greatest party this side of the GPS perimeter. **Chapter 1: The Master Plan** Mr. House Arrest, a man of unparalleled ambition (and limited mobility), set forth his master plan. It involved a series of elaborate traps for partygoers, including a moat (the inflatable pool), drawbridge (a makeshift plank), and a fortress (his mom’s basement jazzed up with disco lights). **Chapter 2: The Invitation Conundrum** Realizing he needed guests for his grand event, Mr. House Arrest turned to social media, crafting an invite so compelling it included the promise of free Wi-Fi and live entertainment, which was really just him DJing from his Spotify playlist titled \\"Party Like You're Not Allowed to Leave.\\" **Chapter 3: Operation Party Prep** In a montage worthy of an '80s movie, Mr. House Arrest dashed around his domain, setting up snacks that ranged from slightly stale chips to culinary experiments gone wrong. Decoration was key, so he strung up lights that would make any interrogation room jealous and blew up enough balloons to concern local air traffic control. **Chapter 4: The Big Night** As the evening approached, guests started to trickle in, lured by the promise of a good time and the curiosity of attending a party that could potentially be a case study in a psychology textbook. They were met by Mr. House Arrest, donning his finest attire — a robe and slippers, accented with the ever-trendy electronic anklet. The party was a hit, with people awkwardly navigating the obstacle course to the basement, where Mr. House Arrest spun tracks and regaled them with tales of how he nearly made it to the mailbox without setting off his anklet. Laughter filled the room, proving that you don't need to step outside to have a good time, especially when the outside can be brought in by court order. **Chapter 5: The Legend Lives On** As the night came to an end, and Mr. House Arrest waved goodbye to his guests from the safety of his doorstep, he knew he had achieved something great. He had turned a limitation into an extravagant soirée, earning him the title of Legend in the local online forums. From that night on, the legend of Mr. House Arrest grew. People spoke of the man who partied like there were literal boundaries because, well, there were. He became an inspiration to all, proving that with a little creativity and a lot of disregard for conventional social gatherings, anyone can be the life of the party. **The End** *Disclaimer: Mr. House Arrest's epic party saga is a work of pure fiction, designed for comedic purposes.

He wasn't always known by this peculiar name. Once, he was simply Fred Fiddlesticks, but after a bizarre incident involving a duck, a harmonica, and an accidental broadcast of the mayor's embarrassing karaoke session on the town's Jumbotron, Fred found himself swiftly renamed and confined to his home. Each morning, Mr. House Arrest would slide out of bed, tripping over his collection of antique ankle monitors, a historical record of his adventures within his own four walls. After his morning stumble, he'd greet his pet goldfish, Bubbles, who was serving a sentence of her own for aggressive staring. \\"Good morning, Bubbles. Planning any daring escapes today?\\" Mr. House Arrest would chuckle to himself, pouring fish flakes into the bowl as Bubbles glared with the intensity of a thousand suns. For entertainment, Mr. House Arrest had taken up various hobbies. He was a master of indoor kite flying, kite crashing, and kite untangling. His most prized possession was a 2-foot indoor kite that perfectly resembled a disgruntled pigeon. \\"Fly free, Percy,\\" he'd say, releasing the kite with a gentle toss only for it to crash into the lamp. \\"As free as we can.\\" However, his greatest challenge and amusement came from his attempts to bake. Mr. House Arrest would often try to follow along with cooking shows, leading to creations such as the \\"Guess What's In It Pie\\" and the infamous \\"Was That Supposed to Be Bread?\\" loaf. He once even accidentally invented a new type of dessert he dubbed \\"Chocolate Surprise.\\" The surprise? It was actually lasagna. But Mr. House Arrest's story takes a delightful turn on one peculiar Tuesday, when he decided to host the first-ever Indoor-Outdoor BBQ. The idea was simple: BBQ inside, with all the windows and doors open, to make it feel like being outside. The guest list was exclusive: Mr. House Arrest, Bubbles, and a rather intrigued next-door neighbor, Miss Curiosity, who often found herself wandering into his yard trying to figure out what was going on inside. As Mr. House Arrest prepared his indoor grill, complete with a small patch of sod to stand on for that authentic \\"outdoor\\" feeling, things quickly spiraled into a hilarity fest. The grill, not used to being indoors, started belting out show tunes, an unexpected feature from its last update. Meanwhile, Bubbles had started a live commentary, bubbling away with what one could only assume were highly critical reviews of the event. Miss Curiosity, ever so intrigued, peered in through the window wearing a homemade hazmat suit fashioned from shower curtains and rubber gloves. \\"Is that...are you grilling with a singing grill?\\" she asked, her voice muffled but clearly amused. \\"Yes! Would you care to join? I've got extra sod!\\" Mr. House Arrest replied with a beaming smile, extending a patch of grass towards her like it was a dance invitation. As the evening wound down, with the indoor fireworks display (courtesy of a particularly ambitious sparkler experiment), Mr. House Arrest, Bubbles, and Miss Curiosity found themselves laughing under the soft glow of the fluorescent kitchen lights. They had discovered something truly wonderful: even in the most confined circumstances, joy, laughter, and a bit of creativity could ignite the most vibrant of indoor barbecues. And from that day on, Mr. House Arrest was no longer just the man confined to his home by an amusing twist of fate but rather the innovator of indoor levity, proving that walls, much like spirits, need not be confined. And as for Bubbles? Let's just say she's considering a career in stand-up comedy, assuming she can find a fishbowl big enough for her ambitions. --- *In the end, Mr. House Arrest taught everyone in DoodleSnooze a valuable lesson: laughter and a sprinkle of madness can turn even the confines of your own home into an endless playground of absurdity and joy.*"},{"prompt":"123","completion":"You've shared \\"123\\" with me.

Given your description, you're aiming for a look that is not just affluent but drips opulence and grandeur, focusing on a \\"bigger crown and full diamond outfit.\\" Here's a conceptual breakdown to inspire your creation: # Crown: 1. **Design Foundation**: Start with a silver or platinum base for the crown, as these materials will enhance the brilliance of the diamonds. The design should be intricate, with elaborate curves and points to give it a majestic and imposing presence. 2. **Diamond Arrangement**: Use a variety of diamond cuts - round brilliant, marquise, pear, and emerald cuts – to add depth and spark different refractions of light. Arrange the diamonds in tiers, with larger stones anchoring the design and smaller stones providing detailed embellishments. 3. **Additional Gemstones**: While the focus is on diamonds, incorporating a few colored gemstones like sapphires, rubies, or emeralds could accentuate the diamonds' brilliance and add depth to the crown's appearance. # Outfit: 1. **Fabric Base**: A gown made from silk or satin in a neutral color would serve as an excellent canvas for the diamonds to stand out. Choose a silhouette that complements the wearer's form, perhaps a fitted bodice with an expansive skirt or a sleek, form-fitting dress to modernize the look. 2. **Diamond Embellishment**: The entire outfit should be adorned with diamonds. Use smaller diamonds to create intricate patterns across the fabric, resembling a celestial map or floral designs. The hems, cuffs, and neckline should be lined with larger diamonds for a pronounced statement of luxury. 3. **Accessories**: Diamond-encrusted gloves, high heels, and a clutch. Each piece should echo the design language of the crown and gown, creating a cohesive look. # Practical Considerations: - **Weight**: An outfit and crown fully embellished with diamonds will be incredibly heavy. It's essential to consider the comfort and mobility of the wearer, perhaps by distributing the weight evenly or creating detachable parts for ease of movement. - **Security and Insurability**: Due to the immense value such an ensemble would represent, security considerations during its creation, unveiling, and transportation cannot be overstated. Insuring the outfit and crown would also be crucial. - **Symbolism**: Use the design to tell a story or convey a message. The arrangement of diamonds and choice of additional gemstones can symbolize different virtues or aspects of the wearer's personality or heritage. - **Technology Integration**: To push the boundaries further, consider integrating subtle lighting beneath some diamonds to create an otherworldly glow, or employ motion-sensitive technology to make certain diamonds gently oscillate in their settings, creating a mesmerizing effect. Designing such a high-caliber, diamond-encrusted outfit and crown will require not only exceptional craftsmanship and a significant budget but also a visionary approach to blend luxury with wearability."},{"prompt":"Знаешь ли ты за сколько можно продать ООО в России которому 4 года и которое не вело деятельности?","completion":"Стоимость продажи ООО (общества с ограниченной ответственностью) в России, которому 4 года и которое не вело деятельности, будет зависеть от множества факторов. Поскольку компания не вела деятельности, ее ценность может быть достаточно низкой для потенциального покупателя, если не учитывать другие аспекты. Вот некоторые из факторов, влияющих на стоимость такой компании: 1. **Наличие и состояние документации**: Полный и чистый пакет документов без нарушений и задолженностей может увеличить интерес покупателей. 2. **Налоговые обязательства**: Несмотря на отсутствие деятельности, важно, чтобы все налоговые декларации были правильно поданы и не было задолженностей по налогам и сборам. 3. **Репутация и история компании**: Этот пункт может не иметь большого значения для компании, которая не вела деятельности, но отсутствие негативной истории и проблем с законом повысит ее привлекательность. 4. **Стоимость реорганизации**: Если покупатель планирует использовать ООО для ведения бизнеса, он учтет расходы на внесение изменений в учредительные документы, смену юридического адреса, руководства и прочее. 5. **Желаемая скорость сделки**: ООО \\"с историей\\", даже не ведущее деятельности, может быть ценно для тех, кто ищет возможность быстро начать дело без процесса регистрации новой компании. Поэтому, несмотря на отсутствие универсальной оценки, стоимость такой компании может варьироваться от символической суммы (если цель продавца просто избавиться от юридического лица без задолженностей) до десятков или даже сотен тысяч рублей в зависимости от упомянутых выше факторов. Для точной оценки и лучшего понимания текущего положения дел рекомендуется обратиться к профессионалам в области юридических услуг и корпоративного права, которые смогут провести анализ и предложить реальную рыночную стоимость на основе всех релевантных данных и актуальной практики."},{"prompt":"Зачем могут покупать такое ООО? Можно ли на него получить большой кредит?","completion":"Покупка ООО, которое уже зарегистрировано и имеет \\"историю\\", может иметь несколько преимуществ перед созданием новой компании с нуля. Вот несколько причин, по которым такие компании приобретаются: 1. **Экономия времени на регистрацию**: Регистрация новой компании может быть довольно длительным процессом, включающим сбор документов, подачу в регистрирующие органы и ожидание. Покупка существующего ООО позволяет избежать этого. 2. **Контракты и тендеры**: Для участия в некоторых государственных и частных тендерах требуется, чтобы компания существовала и функционировала определенный срок. В таком случае покупка \\"старого\\" ООО дает преимущество перед новыми компаниями. 3. **Банковские кредиты и линии финансирования**: На практике старше компании, теоретически, могут иметь больше шансов на получение кредитов, так как банки и кредитные организации могут рассматривать историю существования компании как фактор надежности. Однако важным критерием будет деятельность компании и ее финансовое состояние, а не только возраст ООО. Наличие дохода, активной экономической деятельности и положительной кредитной истории значительно важнее, чем просто возраст компании. Именно по этой последней причине получение \\"большого кредита\\" на ООО, которое никогда не вело деятельности, будет очень сложным. Банки проводят тщательный анализ финансового состояния компании, ее бизнес-плана, отчетности и других факторов перед выдачей кредита. Если компания не имеет истории сделок, движения средств и прибыли, вероятно, ей будет отказано в кредитовании. Таким образом, хотя существующее ООО с историей на первый взгляд может казаться привлекательным объектом для покупки с целью получения кредита, на практике без доказательства эффективного и прибыльного бизнеса, занимаемого данной компанией, такой план вряд ли увенчается успехом."},{"prompt":"Какие контракты и тренды могут быть предоставлены для тавого ООО?","completion":"При покупке ООО, которое не вело деятельности, но имеет определённый \\"возраст\\" на рынке, возможности для заключения контрактов и участия в тендерах становятся одним из ключевых стимулов для такого приобретения. Однако стоит понимать, что успешность в получении контрактов и тендеров будет в значительной мере зависеть не только от возраста компании, но и от её репутации, финансового состояния, опыта и квалификации персонала, а также от наличия необходимых лицензий и разрешений. Ниже представлены некоторые области, в которых \\"старое\\" ООО может претендовать на контракты или участие в тендерах: # 1. Государственные и муниципальные закупки Зачастую для участия в государственных и муниципальных тендерах устанавливаются определённые требования к участникам, включая минимальный срок существования компании. В таких ситуациях компания с историей может быть в более выгодном положении по сравнению с недавно зарегистрированными фирмами. # 2. Крупные частные контракты Крупные частные организации и корпорации также могут устанавливать свои критерии отбора поставщиков и подрядчиков, включая требования к длительности существования компании на рынке. Это особенно актуально в таких отраслях, как строительство, поставки оборудования, ИТ-услуги и прочее. # 3. Доверие клиентов и партнёров Компании с \\"историей\\" могут восприниматься как более надёжные и стабильные партнёры. Это может сыграть важную роль при заключении долгосрочных контрактов или при работе в секторах, где важна репутация и опыт компании. # Условия для успеха Чтобы использовать преимущества \\"возраста\\" компании при получении контрактов и участии в тендерах, важно также обеспечить наличие следующих условий: - Чистая и прозрачная репутация, отсутствие юридических проблем и нарушений в истории компании. - Подтверждённые квалификации и опыт руководящего состава и ключевых сотрудников. - Наличие всех необходимых лицензий, разрешений и сертификации для выбранной сферы деятельности. - Адекватная финансовая отчётность, подтверждающая стабильность компании и способность выполнить обязательства по контракту.

В течении какого периода?","completion":"В российском законодательстве отсутствие признаков деятельности юридического лица в течение определенного времени является одной из причин для инициирования процедуры исключения организации из Единого государственного реестра юридических лиц (ЕГРЮЛ). Это может произойти, если организация не сдает отчетность, не осуществляет экономические операции через свой расчетный счет и не выполняет другие виды деятельности, которые могут быть зафиксированы и проверены налоговыми органами. # Период Отсутствия Деятельности: Согласно действующему законодательству Российской Федерации, налоговый орган вправе инициировать процедуру исключения юридического лица из ЕГРЮЛ за отсутствие деятельности в течение **12 последовательных месяцев**. Важно отметить, что отсчет этого периода начинается с последней зарегистрированной даты любой деятельности, например, с последней банковской операции или последней сданной отчетности. # Определение признаков деятельности: Признаки деятельности включают в себя: - Сдача налоговой отчетности. - Произведение хозяйственных операций (покупка товаров, услуг, оплата налогов, аренды и так далее). - Наличие трудовой деятельности (подтверждающейся, например, выплатой зарплат работникам). # Что делать, если ваше ООО подвергается исключению за отсутствие признаков деятельности: 1. **Подтвердить активность**: Предоставьте налоговому органу доказательства вашей деятельности в течение указанного периода. Это может быть отчетность, документация по банковским операциям, договоры аренды, контракты на покупку товаров или услуг и так далее. 2. **Восстановить деятельность**: Если деятельность действительно не велась, рассмотрите возможность ее восстановления и нормализации работы компании, включая начало операций и подачу отчетности. 3. **Юридическая помощь**: В случае возникновения спорных моментов или сложностей с интерпретацией законодательства, обратитесь за квалифицированной юридической помощью. Сохранение активности ООО и своевременная подача всей необходимой отчетности являются ключевыми аспектами для предотвращения рисков исключения из ЕГРЮЛ."},{"prompt":"Если деятельность фактически не велась, но нулевая отчётность сдавалась регулярно, может ли это расмматриваться как отсутствие деятельности?","completion":"В российском законодательстве подача \\"нулевой отчетности\\" может быть рассмотрена как юридическое доказательство того, что компания формально осуществляет свою деятельность, однако не имеет фактической хозяйственной или иной активности за рассматриваемый период. Нулевая отчетность означает, что компания не имела ни доходов, ни расходов, но при этом выполняла свои обязательства по сдаче отчетов перед налоговыми органами. Отсутствие фактической хозяйственной активности, но сдача нулевой отчетности теоретически может быть расценено как наличие признаков деятельности в значении исполнения компанией минимальных требований законодательства по поддержанию своего статуса как действующего юридического лица. Поэтому, даже при отсутствии реальной хозяйственной или иной активности, регулярная подача нулевой отчетности снижает риск исключения компании из ЕГРЮЛ по основанию полного отсутствия деятельности. Однако важно понимать, что подходы налоговых органов могут отличаться, и в некоторых случаях для оценки активности компании могут потребоваться дополнительные показатели, например, наличие хозяйственных операций, выплата зарплат сотрудникам и прочее. Поэтому, несмотря на то что регулярная подача нулевой отчетности формально выступает в качестве одного из признаков существования юридического лица, компаниям может быть рекомендовано демонстрировать дополнительную активность для подтверждения полноценного функционирования. Также важно отметить, что Федеральная налоговая служба (ФНС) России реализует меры по выявлению и исключению из ЕГРЮЛ так называемых \\"мертвых душ\\" или недействующих компаний. В этом контексте, подача нулевой отчетности на протяжении многих лет может сигнализировать о необходимости проведения проверки деятельности такой компании, чтобы установить, выполняет ли она какие-либо функции или является недействующим юридическим лицом.

В соответствии с законодательством РФ, после отправки уведомления о предстоящем исключении юридического лица из-за недостоверности адреса компания обычно имеет 6 месяцев на то, чтобы предпринять необходимые действия для исправления ситуации. Этот срок предоставляется для того, чтобы юридическое лицо могло: 1. Исправить ошибочные данные о юридическом адресе, предоставив документы, подтверждающие законность нового адреса. 2. Обжаловать решение о предстоящем исключении, если считаете его неправомерным.

Ответь точно. 6 месяцев с полученич проблемы о недостоверности уже прошло, а решение об исключении пришло только сейчас.","completion":"Извините за предыдущую путаницу. Давайте уточним ситуацию. Согласно действующему законодательству Российской Федерации, у юридического лица есть возможность исправить ситуацию до момента фактического исключения из ЕГРЮЛ. Процесс исключения юридического лица начинается с момента получения уведомления о предстоящем исключении, а не с момента выявления проблемы (в вашем случае, недостоверности юридического адреса). Если получено решение об исключении, это означает, что процесс уже близится к завершению. Однако в тексте самого решения об исключении или в уведомлении о предстоящем исключении должны быть указаны сроки, в течение которых вы можете предпринять действия для исправления ситуации и приостановки процесса исключения. Обычно после уведомления о предстоящем исключении предоставляется время на устранение причин, послуживших основанием для исключения. **Что делать:** - Немедленно обратитесь в регистрирующий орган (налоговая служба, предоставившая уведомление) для получения точной информации о том, какие ещё действия вы можете предпринять для предотвращения исключения из ЕГРЮЛ. - Если проблема заключается в недостоверном юридическом адресе и сроки ещё не истекли, необходимо как можно быстрее предоставить документы, подтверждающие новый юридический адрес. - В случае если прошло уже 6 месяцев после первоначального уведомления о недостоверности адреса, и вы только сейчас получили решение об исключении, крайне важно отреагировать максимально быстро, так как на практике после получения решения об исключении времени на устранение нарушений остается достаточно мало. **Важно:** - Точные сроки и процедурные нюансы могут зависеть от конкретных обстоятельств дела и времени, прошедшего с момента выявления нарушения. Поэтому рекомендуется консультироваться с юристом для правильного и своевременного реагирования на уведомление об исключении. - Если вам пришло решение об исключении, значит, налоговая организация уже приняла решение о вашем исключении из ЕГРЮЛ, и вам необходимо действовать немедленно, чтобы приостановить или отменить это решение."},{"prompt":"Что неписать налоговой?

Now, before you go about making assumptions, let me clarify - Mr. BannedFromThePlayground was not your average \\"banned\\" fella. Oh no, he was banned for reasons so hilariously absurd, the birds still giggle about it when they fly over the playground. Chapter 1: A Special Kind Of Silly Mr. BannedFromThePlayground was a plump, jovial man with a passion for two things: comedy and playgrounds. Sadly, his sense of humor was as developed as a sloth's workout regime. One sunny afternoon, while attempting to impress a squirrel with his impersonation of a teeter-totter in distress, he found himself in a pickle - a literal, life-sized, plastic pickle. It was part of the playground's \\"Vegetable Land,\\" an area designed to inspire healthy eating. Unfortunately, the only thing it inspired in Mr. Banned was a peculiar desire to see if he could fit inside. Spoiler: He could. Getting out, however, was a different story. Chapter 2: The Slide Saga Begins The incident with the pickle was but a minor hiccup in the grand scheme of Mr. BannedFromThePlayground's adventures. The real trouble began with the infamous slide - The Whirlwind Woozle. This was no ordinary slide; it was a twisty, turny, tale of terror for the faint of heart. But for Mr. Banned, it was love at first slide. Determined to set a record for the most slides in a minute, Mr. Banned concocted a plan. He dawned his most aerodynamic outfit - a swimsuit covered in cooking oil. The result? A human bullet shooting down the slide with enough speed to create a sonic boom in his wake. Children cheered, birds scattered, and the local wildlife formed a fan club. Mr. Banned was unstoppable until he was very, very stoppable. Chapter 3: The Slide Incident On what was to be his record-breaking slide, Mr. Banned launched himself with gusto. Unfortunately, his aim was as off as his understanding of physics. Instead of sliding down, he flew over the slide's edge, gracefully arc-ing through the air like a greased watermelon in a county fair contest. His landing? A soft, squelchy plop into the sandbox - creating a human-sized crater and a sandstorm that blanketed the entire playground. The aftermath was spectacular. Kids were digging sand out of their ears for weeks. Squirrels were found miles away, still coated in a fine layer of playground dust. And Mr. Banned? He emerged with a smile, a mouthful of sand, and a lifetime ban. Chapter 4: A Bounce Back You might think this is where Mr. BannedFromThePlayground's story ends, but you'd be as wrong as a kangaroo on a trampoline. Embracing his ban with pride, Mr. Banned turned his backyard into the ultimate playground - complete with a slide engineered to be 100% ejection-free. Mr. Banned's misadventures became the stuff of legend. Children from all over would come to hear tales of The Man Who Was Too Much for the Playground, and his backyard became a haven for those seeking laughter, joy, and a slide that didn't catapult you into next week. The moral of our story? If at first, you don't succeed, slide, slide again - just maybe not at the public playground. And so, in the town of Normal-But-Not, life was a little funnier, a touch zanier, and infinitely more entertaining, all thanks to Mr. BannedFromThePlayground - the man who taught us all the true meaning of playground love."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

VOMIT And The Day He Tried To Hold It In** In the vast, technicolor lands of Mr. Men and Little Miss, there lived a certain Mr. Vomit, who, unfortunately, lived up to his name in ways that could only be described as explosively spectacular. Today's story, dear reader, is about the day Mr. Vomit tried to hold it in. Yes, you read it correctly. Hold. It. In. A quest so daring, so audacious, it was bound to go down in the hall of comedic misadventures. It all began on one sunny morning when Mr. Vomit decided he’d had enough. Enough of the stares, the whispers, and the oh-so-polite invitations to please not attend the annual Mr. Men and Little Miss Picnic. \\"Today,\\" he declared to his reflection, which was looking rather green around the gills, \\"I will become Mr. Hold-It-In!\\" With determination in his heart and a large pack of breath mints in his pocket (for emergencies), Mr. Vomit set off. His first challenge arrived swiftly in the form of Mr. Greedy, who was hosting a breakfast banquet in the middle of the street—because where else would you hold it? \\"Eat, my friend!\\" boomed Mr. Greedy, thrusting a dish of scrambled eggs, a tower of toast, and a side of sizzling sausages under Mr. Vomit’s nose. Mr. Vomit’s eyes widened, his stomach churned, but he thought of his new title. \\"No, thank you, I'm on a...diet,\\" he stammered, clapping a hand over his mouth as he dashed away, leaving a bewildered Mr. Greedy in his wobbly wake. Next came Little Miss Helpful, who, in an attempt to assist Mr. Vomit with his quest, had concocted a potion. \\"It’ll settle your stomach for sure!\\" she chirped, mixing ingredients that fizzed and popped like a soda can in a paint shaker. As Mr. Vomit sipped the neon-green concoction, his eyes bulged. Every known law of physics and digestion was questioned in that moment before, with a Herculean effort, he swallowed and sprinted off, cheeks puffed, leaving behind a proud (and slightly confused) Little Miss Helpful. The final test, however, was the grand picnic itself. Mr. Vomit arrived, sweaty but determined, to find a spread that would make a grown man weep, and a sensitive-stomached Mr. Men downright flee. Mr. Jelly was bouncing on a gigantic jelly, Mr. Messy was, well, being his usual self, and at the center of it all was Mr. Tickle, arms at the ready for the grandest tickle fight Frolicking Fields had ever seen. As Mr. Tickle's arms stretched towards him, Mr. Vomit's resolve crumbled. This was it. The moment of truth. He shut his eyes tight, bracing for impact...but instead of the anticipated catastrophe, what emerged was a burp. A loud, resonating, and surprisingly musical belch that rang throughout the lands. Silence fell, followed by a chorus of laughter. Mr. Vomit opened his eyes to find he had become the hero of the hour, transforming a picnic into an impromptu concert with a single, unprecedented belch. So, dear reader, Mr. Vomit learned an important lesson that day. Sometimes, it’s not about holding it in, but letting it out in the most spectacular way possible. And as for the new nickname? Let’s just say Mr. Belch had a nice ring to it.

Mr. Ew was, for lack of a better description, the epitome of \\"Ew.\\" You see, Mr. Ew had an aversion to water that was almost legendary. Even the mere mention of a bath would send him scuttling away faster than the speed of discomfort. Chapter 1: The Introduction to Ewwiness Mr. Ew lived in a house that, quite honestly, looked like it was marinating in a century-worth of dirt. The lawn was so unkept, weeds were filing for squatter's rights. Inside, a peculiar aroma wafted through the air, a mixture of old cheese and the sorrow of unwashed socks. Yet, in this chaos, Mr. Ew found comfort, surrounded by piles of what he lovingly referred to as \\"future antiques.\\" Chapter 2: The Incident One sunny, albeit smelly day, something unprecedented happened — Mr. Ew received an invitation to the annual Cleanville Banquet, a prestigious event known for its dazzling hygiene standards. The invitation must've lost a bet to end up at Mr. Ew's grimy doorstep. This, however, presented a problem of epic, stinky proportions. To attend, Mr. Ew would have to do the unthinkable — clean up. Chapter 3: The Hilariously Tragic Attempt at Grooming After much deliberation and a few gag reflexes, Mr. Ew decided to embark on the Herculean task of grooming. He started with his hair, applying a substance that bore a striking resemblance to shampoo. The shampoo, unused to such hostile working conditions, submitted its two weeks' notice immediately. Next, clothes. Mr. Ew, rummaging through his wardrobe, found an outfit that only screamed in horror a little. It was progress. Chapter 4: The Banquet and the Cheese Incident Miraculously, Mr. Ew managed to make it to the banquet. He was the embodiment of \\"polished turd.\\" However, just as he started to blend in, disaster struck. A waiter, carrying a tray of exotic cheeses, collided with Mr. Ew. The impact was cataclysmic. Cheese flew everywhere, and as Mr. Ew tried to apologize, he emitted a burp so potent, it peeled the varnish off the nearby furniture. Chaos ensued as guests scrambled, attributing the toxic event to a biochemical attack. Mr. Ew, realizing his mistake, decided to make a swift exit, leaving behind a banquet hall in utter disarray and several guests questioning their life choices. Chapter 5: The Moral of the Story Days later, Mr. Ew reflected on the incident. He realized that maybe, just maybe, personal hygiene wasn't such a bad thing. So, he took a baby step towards improvement — he decided to air out his house. Unfortunately, this led to a small ecological disaster as the fresh air coming in contact with the concentrated \\"Ew\\" created a weather phenomenon known henceforth as \\"The Great Stink.\\" Despite the setback, Mr. Ew remained undeterred. He had discovered something powerful — the ability to clear a room faster than anyone else. And with great power, comes great irresponsibility. The End. --- I hope this Mr. Men's adult adventure drew a laugh or two from you with its over-the-top silliness! Remember to take it all in good fun.

Reader discretion and a strong stomach are advised.)* In the whimsical world of Laughalot Land, where the birds chirp punchlines and the sun shines in comedic timing, lived a rather... unconventional character. His name? Mr. Vomit. Yes, you heard right. With a complexion as green as an overripe lime and a tendency to get queasy at the drop of a hat, Mr. Vomit was, well, a bit of a handful. Chapter 1: A Queasy Morning One sunny morning, Mr. Vomit woke up feeling unusually optimistic. \\"Today,\\" he declared to his reflection, which looked sickly even on a good day, \\"I shall go on an adventure and try not to vomit.\\" The reflection seemed to gag in response. After consuming his breakfast—a questionable smoothie made of ginger and Pepto-Bismol—Mr. Vomit set out, armed with a plethora of air sickness bags. Chapter 2: The Gastro Gauntlet Mr. Vomit's first stop was Mr. Greedy's new all-you-can-eat buffet. \\"A true test of my fortitude!\\" he exclaimed, his voice a mixture of excitement and preemptive regret. The buffet was a minefield of gastronomical threats: from the spicy chili mountains to the greasy pizza valleys, each dish was more menacing than the last. Mr. Vomit, ever the optimist, piled his plate high, ignoring the bewildered looks from the other Mr. Men and Little Misses. He sat down, took a deep breath (a risky move in itself), and dug in. Chapter 3: The Landscape of Laughter Three bites in, and Mr. Vomit's adventure seemed to come to a premature end. But then, a miracle! Little Miss Hilarious, sensing a comedic opportunity, bounded over. With a flick of her wrist, she transformed the mountain of chilli into a hilarious jelly, causing the table to erupt in laughter. Laughing so hard he forgot to feel sick, Mr. Vomit found himself miraculously cured, if only temporarily. Each slapstick slip on a jelly, each snort and roar of laughter, acted like a balm to his beleaguered stomach. Chapter 4: The Unexpected Hero Feeling emboldened, Mr. Vomit decided to take on the ultimate challenge: The Rollercoaster of Doom at Mr. Brave's amusement park. Queueing up, he felt waves of nausea lap at the shores of his determination. But he stood firm, a sickly green tower of resolve. As the coaster took off, Mr. Vomit's world spun. Up, down, sideways—his stomach did loops independent of the ride. Yet, as they hit a particularly wild loop-the-loop, something extraordinary happened. Mr. Vomit did vomit, but in a spectacular rainbow arc that painted the sky with color. It was a thing of beauty, an art piece born of queasiness. Chapter 5: The Joyful Conclusion Mr. Vomit's technicolor performance was met with a standing ovation. It turned out that in Laughalot Land, even the most embarrassing moments could be celebrated as long as they brought joy. From that day on, Mr. Vomit embraced his name and his unruly stomach. He became a regular at Mr. Greedy's, the unlikely muse of Little Miss Hilarious, and the star attraction at Mr. Brave's amusement park. And so, our story ends on a high note, with Mr. Vomit, a little queasy but a lot heroic, proving that even in a world filled with laughter, there's room for a few gags of the literal kind. **The End.** *(Remember, in Laughalot Land, the only thing to fear is the fear of missing out on a good laugh.

A mansion stretching far, adorned in gold and black, evokes a sense of regal elegance and wealth that's almost mythical. This palace, sprawling and magnificent, could easily be the centerpiece of a fantastical story or the dream of someone who aspires to an almost unimaginable opulence. The mansion, with its expansive halls and rooms, would be a testament to the owner's wealth and status. Gold, a universal symbol of wealth, could be found in the fixtures and decorations, sparkling under the grand chandeliers, and highlighting the architectural beauty of the mansion. Black, providing a stark, stylish contrast, adds a modern touch to the mansion, ensuring it stands out as a paragon of contemporary luxury. Within its walls, massive piles of cash symbolize not just financial wealth but a level of affluence that grants the owner unlimited possibilities. This isn't just wealth for necessity's sake; it's wealth that represents power, the ability to fulfill every whim and fancy, whether it be collecting prized art, hosting lavish parties, or supporting grand philanthropic endeavors. However, this imagery, while dazzling, also prompts a reflection on the responsibilities and potential isolations that come with such extreme wealth. It serves as a reminder of the diverse values people assign to money and luxury, and the varied goals and dreams different individuals pursue, be they material, experiential, or emotional. Ultimately, the image of a bigger, fatter mansion dripping in gold and black, surrounded by endless wealth, encapsulates the extreme pinnacle of material success in the imagination, serving as both an aspirational fantasy and a platform for considering the broader implications of wealth."},{"prompt":"Рассчитать статический и динамический коэффициенты использования грузоподъемности, а также среднее расстояние ездки lег с грузом на автомобиле ЗИЛ-133 грузоподъемностью 10 т, если известны следующие условия работы ПС: Q = 20 т (объём перевозок за рабочий день), nе = 3 (кол. поездок за день) , P = 200 ткм (грузооборот), Lг = 30 км (пробег с грузом по маршруту).","completion":"Для расчёта статического и динамического коэффициентов использования грузоподъемности, а также среднего расстояния ездки лег с грузом, воспользуемся следующими формулами: 1.

Среднюю массу груза (Mср) можно найти, разделив общую массу перевезенного груза (Q) на количество поездок (nе): [ M_{ср} = frac{Q}{n_{е}} ] [ K_{ст} = frac{M_{ср}}{Г} ] где Г - грузоподъемность автомобиля. 2. Динамический коэффициент использования грузоподъемности (Kдин) определяется как отношение грузооборота (P) к произведению грузоподъемности (Г) на общий пробег с грузом: [ K_{дин} = frac{P}{Г times L_{г} times n_{е}} ] 3. Среднее расстояние ездки с грузом вычисляется как отношение общего пробега с грузом (Lг) к количеству поездок (nе): [ L_{ср} = frac{P}{Q} ] Подставим известные значения: Г = 10 т (грузоподъемность автомобиля) Q = 20 т (общий объем перевозок за день) nе = 3 (количество поездок за день) P = 200 ткм (грузооборот) Lг = 30 км (расстояние ездки с грузом) [ M_{ср} = frac{20 т}{3 поездки} ≈ 6.67 т ] [ K_{ст} = frac{6.67 т}{10 т} = 0.667 ] [ K_{дин} = frac{200 ткм}{10 т times 30 км times 3} = frac{200}{900} ≈ 0.222 ] [ L_{ср} = frac{200 ткм}{20 т} = 10 км ] Таким образом,: - Статический коэффициент использования грузоподъемности составляет 0.667. - Динамический коэффициент использования грузоподъемности - 0.222. - Среднее расстояние ездки с грузом - 10 км. Обратите внимание, что среднее расстояние ездки было в задании представлено как расстояние ездки с грузом (Lг = 30 км), но расчет подразумевает грузооборот и общий объем перевозок, отсюда точный расчет дал другой результат (10 км), что указывает на возможное недопонимание в формулировке задачи или расчёте.

Общее время простоя на погрузке и разгрузке для одного пункта можно рассчитать как tп + tр.

Попугаи - социальные птицы, которые требуют внимания и стимуляции для поддержания здоровья и счастья. Вот несколько идей, как можно активно и интересно проводить время со своим пернатым другом: 1. **Игрушки для исследования**: Предложите вашему попугаю различные безопасные игрушки, которые он может исследовать. Это могут быть колокольчики, лестницы, висячие качели, игрушки для грызения из безопасных материалов. Многие попугаи любят игрушки, которые издают звуки или могут быть уничтожены (например, картон или мягкая древесина). 2. **\\"Кормление из рук\\"**: Начните кормить попугая небольшими лакомствами из рук. Это не только способствует социализации, но и создает прочную связь между вами и вашим попугаем. 3. **Учебные сессии**: Попугаи чрезвычайно умны и способны учиться различным трюкам и командам. Используйте положительное подкрепление (например, лакомства) для обучения попугая простым командам типа \\"идти на руку\\", \\"возвращаться\\", или даже имитировать звуки. 4. **Музыка и танцы**: Многие попугаи любят слушать музыку и даже попрыгать под неё. Включите мягкую музыку и попробуйте подпевать или танцевать вместе с попугаем. Некоторые попугаи могут начать подпевать или имитировать ритм. 5. **Игры \\"прятки\\"**: Попугаи обожают игру в прятки. Прячьте лакомство в руке или под предметами вокруг него и подбадривайте исследовать и находить. 6. **Лазание и полеты**: Создайте безопасную зону, где попугай может лазить и (если это возможно и безопасно) летать. Используйте стойки для попугаев или даже специально оборудованный домик, чтобы добавить физическую активность в жизнь птицы. 7. **Интерактивные игры**: Используйте игрушки, которые требуют взаимодействия, например, пазлы для попугаев, где нужно использовать клюв для доставания лакомства. Важно помнить, что все игры и активности должны проходить под вашим наблюдением, чтобы обеспечить безопасность попугая. Регулярные игры помогут поддерживать вашего пернатого друга счастливым, здоровым и умственно активным."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) MR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT","completion":"**Mr. Copyright Infringement** It was an ordinary day in Dillydale, at least as ordinary as it gets in a place where everyone is a living embodiment of a singular personality trait or profession. Today, however, was a day that would live in infamy, for it was the day Mr. Copyright Infringement moved into town. Mr. Copyright Infringement wasn't like the other residents. He was a creature of habit, but not good habits. No, he had the habit of unintentionally mimicking everything and everyone around him. It wasn't his fault, really; he was born this way, a living, breathing parody of the world. He arrived in Dillydale with his box of belongings – which suspiciously looked like everyone else's belongings but with mustaches drawn on them. His first visit was to Mr. Tickle, who greeted him with, you guessed it, a tickle! Mr. Copyright Infringement couldn't help himself. He tickles back, but with 110% more intensity, nearly causing a town-wide tickle crisis. \\"Oh, I didn't mean to! It's just who I am!\\" he exclaimed, trying to apologize while unintentionally mimicking Mr. Tickle's iconic giggling. Next on his unintentional parody spree was a visit to Little Miss Sunshine. He greeted her with a smile so wide and so bright it caused three days of unexpected snowfall in Dillydale (because, obviously, that's how weather works here). Little Miss Sunshine couldn't help but feel a bit outshone. \\"I'm so sorry, Miss Sunshine! I didn't mean to steal your… uh… sunshine!\\" he blurted out, now mimicking her radiant disposition so well that nearby flowers began to bloom out of season in confusion. As word spread about the new resident's hilarious yet disruptive antics, Mr. Copyright Infringement became the talk of the town. Literally, as he started mimicking the town's gossip, but in different accents he didn't even know he could do. Mr. Uppity tried to give him a stern talking to, lecturing him about originality and respect for others' identities, but before long, Mr. Uppity found himself wearing a fake mustache and speaking in a badly mimicked version of his own pompous tone. It was clear; Mr. Copyright Infringement's influence was undeniable. It wasn't long before a town meeting was called, led by Mr. Happy, to address \\"The Infringement Situation.\\" The room was tense, filled with the buzz of concerned and slightly amused townsfolk. \\"Ahem, we need to come up with a constructive way to help Mr. Copyright Infringement,\\" Mr. Happy began, trying to keep the mood light. \\"Any suggestions?\\" After a long, thoughtful silence, Little Miss Inventor had a stroke of genius. \\"What if we embrace it? Let's throw a party where everyone mimics each other on purpose. We'll call it 'Dillydale's Day of Imitation!'\\" The idea was a hit! The town threw the biggest, most hilariously confusing party Dillydale had ever seen. Everyone dressed up and acted like each other, and for one day, Mr. Copyright Infringement felt right at home. As the sun set on Dillydale's Day of Imitation, the townsfolk learned an important lesson about acceptance and laughter. And Mr. Copyright Infringement? Well, he found his place in the world, mustaches and all, in a town that celebrated uniqueness, even if that uniqueness was borrowed. And from that day forward, anytime someone in Dillydale found themselves accidentally copying someone else, they'd just laugh and say, \\"I'm doing a Mr. Copyright Infringement!\\" making him an ironic legend in the town's rich history of peculiar characters."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Overly Enthusiastic","completion":"**Mr. Overly Enthusiastic** In the very vibrant and not-so-quiet town of Hoo-ha-haville, a new silhouette appeared on the horizon. This wasn’t just any silhouette; it was bouncing, leaping, and practically vibrating with an energy that could power the town's lightbulbs for a year. This was Mr. Overly Enthusiastic. Mr. Overly Enthusiastic had enthusiasm that knew no bounds. His first order of business in Hoo-ha-haville? A morning greet! At 4:30 AM, before even the sun had thought about its daily routine, he was at every doorstep, ready with a booming voice that could resurrect a hibernating bear, shouting, \\"Good morning, Hoo-ha-haville! Let’s make today the BEST DAY EVER!\\" Neighbors groaned, curtains twitched, and a choir of sleepy, disgruntled voices mumbled, \\"It's still nighttime...\\" But did Mr. Overly Enthusiastic hear them? Of course not! He was already enthusiastically planning his next enthusiastic move. His spirit was contagious, though perhaps more similar to a rash that one couldn't get rid of, no matter how hard they tried. By noon, he had roped Mr. Grumpy into a \\"Best Smile Competition\\", which, to be honest, was more of a \\"Who Can Grimace Less Painfully\\" event. Mr. Grumpy’s participation was a historical moment, noteworthy of a town plaque. Mr. Overly Enthusiastic’s idea of a fun afternoon involved organizing Hoo-ha-haville’s first-ever \\"Enthusiasm Parade\\". Picture this: a parade where the only floats are Mr. Overly Enthusiastic on various vehicles he enthusiastically believed represented \\"the spirit of joy\\". This included a lawnmower (because, why not?), a bathtub on wheels (to represent cleanliness and fun, obviously), and a bed (to show that you can jump right out of it with enthusiasm each morning). The entire town was there, not because they wanted to be, but because Mr. Overly Enthusiastic was magnificently convincing (or persistently persuasive, depending on whom you asked). As dusk fell and one would think it impossible for anyone to maintain such levels of enthusiasm, Mr. Overly Enthusiastic unveiled his pièce de résistance: The Very Explosive Fireworks of Extreme Enthusiasm. Before anyone could say, \\"Perhaps that’s too much enthusiasm,\\" the sky was ablaze with glitter, causing a chicken at Mr. Nervous’s farm to lay square eggs for a week. But here's where the story takes a turn: Mr. Overly Enthusiastic, in his pursuit of spreading utmost joy, had forgotten one tiny thing - dinner. And as the fireworks exploded, stomachs growled louder than the show. That’s when it hit him. Well, not an idea, but a firework misfire, right into his enthusiastic behind, causing him to leap higher than ever, now fueled by surprise and a newfound enthusiasm for safety measures. The next day, amidst the echoes of Hoo-ha-haville’s collective digestive system, Mr. Overly Enthusiastic had an actual, genuinely brilliant idea. He organized a communal breakfast! Everyone was invited, and for the first time, his enthusiasm was met with equal fervor. Because if there’s one thing that can match Mr. Overly Enthusiastic’s energy, it’s the townsfolk’s enthusiasm for food. In the end, Mr. Overly Enthusiastic learned to balance his boundless zeal with just the right goals, becoming the town’s most beloved wake-up call... but not before 7 AM, as per the newly established town law, Article 1: Right to Sleep. And so, Hoo-ha-haville prospered, thrived, and occasionally vibrated slightly off its foundation, all thanks to the unstoppable force of nature that was Mr. Overly Enthusiastic. And Mr. Grumpy? Well, he smiled more, especially on breakfast days."},{"prompt":"long straight black hair red eyes anime girl with GOD QUEEN MASSIVE GARGANTUAN crown and money counter and diamonds and gold and jewelry and luxury outfit and money counter, with huge stacks of cash, in gold and black mansion filled with stacks, kilometers wide piles of cash, obscenely spacious interior filled wtih cash floor to ceiling, widescreen aspect ratio","completion":"Creating an evocative and grand scene as described, with a character that embodies the epitome of wealth and power in an anime style, requires focusing on key elements while adhering to the imaginative boundaries of such a world: Imagine a sprawling mansion, vast and imposing, its architecture a blend of baroque opulence and modern luxury. The mansion, designed in gold and black, stands as a bastion of wealth, its facade adorned with intricate gold leaf designs, set against the velvety darkness of ebony walls. The interior reveals an excessively spacious atrium, where the grandeur truly unfolds. In the center of this space stands a girl, an anime embodiment of divinity and dominion, her long, straight black hair cascading down like a waterfall of obsidian silk, contrasting sharply with her striking red eyes. These eyes, glowing with a supernatural allure, hold the power to captivate and command, mirroring the wealth and authority she wields. Adorning her head is a crown, but not just any crown. It's a monumental, almost architectural wonder in itself, wrought from gold and encrusted with a myriad of diamonds that catch the light, fracturing it into a million shards of brilliance. This crown is not merely an accessory but a symbol of her unparalleled status, so immense and detailed it could almost be its own realm. Her attire complements this grandeur; it is a luxury outfit that perfectly melds the realms of royal vestiture and high fashion. Every inch is crafted from the finest materials, bejeweled and embroidered, reflecting her opulence. Diamonds, gold, and precious jewels are not mere adornments but part of the very fabric of her being, a testament to her wealth and power. In her hand, she holds a money counter, clicking incessantly as it adds up sums that defy comprehension. Around her, enormous stacks of cash, miles upon miles, fill the mansion from floor to ceiling, a literal sea of wealth that stretches out. The stacks are so large they seem to rival the size of buildings, each bill representing a fraction of her immense fortune. The mansion itself, beyond its gold and black grandiosity, is a treasure trove that houses this sea of cash. Every room, every hall is filled to the brim, the cash spilling over like waves, a visual testament to her wealth. The cash is not confined to rooms but piles up in corridors and staircases, an ever-present symbol of excess and power. This image captures a moment frozen in time, a widescreen snapshot of extravagance. The girl, with her god-queen stature, surrounded by her unimaginable wealth, embodies a character of immense power and wealth, ruling over her domain of gold and cash with an unchallenged and intoxicating allure.

However, I can help you by describing how an anime-style character with a larger crown and a full diamond outfit, designed to have as many diamonds as possible, could be depicted in two scenes in widescreen format. Let's visualize this together! # Image 1: The Grand Entrance Scene Description In a grand ballroom filled with shimmering lights and an opulent atmosphere, our character makes her entrance. The wide screen allows for a panoramic view of the lavish setting, with opulent chandeliers and guests adorned in elegant attire, all turning their attention to the protagonist. Character Design - **Pose**: She stands at the top of a grand staircase, one hand gently lifting the skirt of her gown, the other resting on the ornate railing. Her posture exudes confidence and grace. - **Outfit**: Her gown is a masterpiece of diamond embroidery, covering her from shoulders to the floating hem that brushes the stairs. Each movement creates a cascade of sparkles, reflecting the chandelier lights. The dress has a deep V-neckline embellished with the biggest and most lustrous diamonds, drawing attention to her regal bearing. - **Crown and Accessories**: The crown is elaborately designed with layers of diamonds, growing wider at the top, making it the centerpiece of her outfit. Its intricate patterns and the sheer amount of diamonds catch the light with every turn, creating halos around her. Diamond earrings dangle gracefully, and her neck is adorned with multiple layers of diamond necklaces, each differing in design but equally breathtaking. - **Expression**: A slight, confident smile graces her lips. Her eyes sparkle with amusement and authority, engaging the audience. # Image 2: Close-Up in the Moonlight Scene Description The scene shifts to a serene balcony bathed in moonlight. The widescreen format captures the contrast between the dark, peaceful night sky and the brilliance of her diamond dress. Character Design - **Pose**: She leans slightly forward over the balcony railing, gazing thoughtfully at the moon. This intimate posture invites the viewer to a moment of reflection. - **Outfit & Diamonds**: The diamonds on her gown now catch the softer moonlight, creating a more subtle, mystical glow around her. The focus is on the quality of light and how it plays off the different cuts and sizes of the diamonds, adding depth and texture to the visual. - **Crown and Accessories**: In this softer light, the intricacy of her crown is more evident. Its design tells a story, perhaps of her lineage or the battles she's won. Despite the softer light, each diamond in her crown and accessories still sparkles, highlighting her elegance and strength. - **Expression**: Her expression is softer here, introspective. There's a gentle grace to her demeanor, showing a contrast to the commanding presence she has in the ballroom. # Visual Style Both images employ a rich color palette and detailed backgrounds that anime-style art is known for, emphasizing the contrast between the dazzling brightness of the diamonds and the settings they're in. The widescreen format allows for a detailed depiction of the environments, enhancing the storytelling aspect of each scene.

Here are a few examples: 1. **For Sleep Enhancement:** - **Magnesium:** Combining glycine with magnesium can promote relaxation and improve sleep quality. Both are known to have calming effects on the brain and can help decrease sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) and improve overall sleep efficiency. - **Melatonin:** Glycine may also enhance the effects of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. The combination can be particularly effective for people with disrupted circadian rhythms or difficulty falling asleep. 2. **For Cognitive and Neuroprotective Effects:** - **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC):** NAC and glycine have synergistic effects on modulating neurotransmitters and protecting neurons, making the combination potentially beneficial for mental health conditions and cognitive enhancement. - **Creatine:** When it comes to supporting brain health, a combination of glycine (which is one of the amino acids required to form creatine) and supplemental creatine can enhance the body's creatine storage, benefiting cognitive performance and energy production. 3. **For Muscular Health and Performance:** - **Creatine:** Again, because glycine is a precursor to creatine along with arginine and methionine, combining it with additional creatine can support muscle growth, recovery, and performance. - **Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs):** Glycine, when used alongside BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), may contribute to muscle protein synthesis and recovery post-exercise. 4. **For Gut Health:** - **Glutamine:** Both glycine and glutamine are considered conditionally essential amino acids that play a role in gut health and the integrity of the gut lining. Combining them may bolster gut healing, especially in conditions like leaky gut syndrome. 5. **For Joint and Skin Health:** - **Proline and Vitamin C:** These are necessary for collagen synthesis, where glycine acts as a precursor. The combination supports the health of connective tissues, skin elasticity, and joint function. When considering adding supplements to your regimen, it's essential to take into account your current health status, medications, and dietary intake to avoid potential interactions or adverse effects. Consulting with a healthcare professional is always a good practice when adding supplements, especially if aiming to manage or treat specific conditions."},{"prompt":"How are niacin and niacinamide different, and how are they similar? do they have the same benefits?","completion":"Niacin (also known as nicotinic acid) and niacinamide (nicotinamide) are two forms of Vitamin B3, a water-soluble vitamin important for energy metabolism and cell health. Despite their similar names and being derivatives of the same vitamin, they have distinct characteristics and uses but also share some benefits. Here's a breakdown of their differences and similarities: # Differences: 1. **Chemical Structure and Function:** - While both belong to the Vitamin B3 category, their chemical structures differ slightly, which affects how they are utilized in the body. This structural difference influences their pharmacological effects. 2. **Skin Flushing:** - Niacin can cause \\"flushing\\" (redness, warmth, and sometimes itching or burning) of the skin shortly after it's taken. This is due to its vasodilatory effects. Niacinamide, on the other hand, does not cause this flushing, making it a preferred option for those sensitive to this side effect. 3. **Therapeutic Uses:** - Niacin has been widely used to help manage cholesterol levels. It can increase HDL (good) cholesterol and lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and triglycerides. Niacinamide doesn’t have the same significant effect on cholesterol levels but is used for other therapeutic purposes. - Niacinamide is often used in dermatology for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to treat various skin conditions, such as acne and eczema. # Similarities: 1. **Metabolic Role:** - Both play crucial roles in cellular metabolism. They are involved in redox reactions, helping cells to convert proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into energy. 2. **NAD Precursors:** - Both can be converted in the body into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme vital for energy production and DNA repair. 3. **General Health Benefits:** - As forms of Vitamin B3, both contribute to the maintenance of healthy skin, nerves, and digestive systems. 4. **Safety and Toxicity:** - Generally, both are considered safe when taken within recommended doses. High doses, especially of niacin, can lead to adverse effects. # Can They Provide the Same Benefits? To an extent, yes, since they are converted into the essential coenzyme NAD. However, their different pharmacological properties make them more suitable for specific benefits rather than being interchangeable for all functions. For example, niacin is more effective for managing cholesterol levels, whereas niacinamide is beneficial for skin health and does not cause the flushing associated with niacin. In summary, while niacin and niacinamide share core roles related to energy metabolism and cellular health due to their status as Vitamin B3 compounds, their different properties make them suitable for distinct therapeutic uses. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regime, especially if targeting specific health issues."},{"prompt":"Is zinc deficiency common or has it increased over the years","completion":"Zinc deficiency is considered a significant global nutritional problem, affecting populations across various countries and socioeconomic statuses. The prevalence and awareness of zinc deficiency have indeed increased over the years, due in part to better diagnostic techniques, increased awareness among healthcare professionals, and ongoing research into the broad roles zinc plays in human health. # Factors Contributing to Zinc Deficiency Include: 1. **Dietary Patterns:** Diets low in meat, seafood, and poultry—the primary sources of bioavailable zinc—and high in cereals and legumes that contain phytates, which inhibit zinc absorption, can lead to deficiency. 2. **Soil Depletion:** Zinc levels in the soil have a direct impact on the zinc content of crops. Over-farming and poor soil management practices have led to soil zinc depletion in many parts of the world, reducing the amount of zinc people get from plant-based foods. 3. **Malabsorption Syndromes:** Conditions like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and other gastrointestinal disorders can impair zinc absorption. 4. **Increased Physiological Needs:** Pregnancy, lactation, and periods of rapid growth (such as childhood and adolescence) increase the body's demand for zinc, raising the risk of deficiency if intake does not meet these heightened needs. 5. **Chronic Diseases and Medications:** Chronic kidney disease, liver disease, diabetes, and use of certain medications (like diuretics and some antibiotics) can affect zinc status. # Signs of Zinc Deficiency Include: - Impaired growth and development in children - Hair loss - Diarrhea - Delayed wound healing - Altered taste and smell - Skin lesions # Populations at Risk: While zinc deficiency can affect anyone, certain groups are more susceptible, including children in developing countries, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, and those with malabsorption syndromes or chronic kidney disease. # Has It Increased Over Years? The global burden of zinc deficiency has arguably not so much increased as become better recognized. Improved diagnostic approaches and heightened awareness have led to more identified cases and have underscored the importance of zinc in diet and supplementation programs, especially in low-income countries. Various international health initiatives now include zinc supplementation, especially for children, as part of their nutritional programs to combat not just zinc deficiency but also to reduce the incidence of diarrheal diseases and improve overall health outcomes. Worldwide, efforts to combat zinc deficiency include supplementation and fortification programs, dietary diversification, and breeding crop varieties with higher bioavailable zinc content (biofortification). These strategies aim to reduce the incidence of deficiency and underscore the importance of micronutrients like zinc for global health."},{"prompt":"What's better -5htp or l-tryptophan?","completion":"When comparing 5-HTP (5-Hydroxytryptophan) and L-Tryptophan, whether one is better than the other largely depends on individual circumstances, intended uses, and how each person's body responds to these supplements. Both compounds are related to serotonin production but have different characteristics and mechanisms of action in the body. Understanding their roles and effects can help in making an informed decision. # L-Tryptophan: L-Tryptophan is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot produce it; thus, it must be obtained from the diet. It's found in foods like turkey, chicken, milk, potatoes, pumpkin, and various other edibles. Once ingested, L-Tryptophan is converted into 5-HTP in the body, which is then converted into serotonin—a neurotransmitter that plays a vital role in mood, sleep, and pain perception. **Pros:** - Acts more slowly and steadily, potentially causing fewer side effects. - Besides being a precursor to serotonin, it’s also used by the body to generate niacin (vitamin B3) and melatonin, contributing to its versatility. - Generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses. **Cons:** - Its effectiveness as a supplement might be reduced since not all consumed L-Tryptophan is converted into serotonin; it competes with other amino acids for transport across the blood-brain barrier. # 5-HTP: 5-HTP is one step closer than L-Tryptophan in the biochemical pathway leading to serotonin production. It's derived from the seeds of the African plant Griffonia simplicifolia. Because it’s directly converted to serotonin without the need to be first changed into another substance, it may be more effective for some individuals in managing symptoms related to low serotonin levels. **Pros:** - Might offer a more direct and faster way to increase serotonin levels. - Some studies suggest it can be beneficial for depression, sleep disorders, and appetite regulation. **Cons:** - Potentially more immediate effects, but this could also mean a higher risk of side effects, such as gastrointestinal issues or serotonin syndrome when used in high doses or combined with other serotonin-increasing substances. - Because it directly influences serotonin levels, interactions with medications like SSRIs or certain migraine medicines can be dangerous. # Considerations: - **Effectiveness:** Individual responses to 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan can vary. Some may find one more effective than the other due to personal differences in metabolism and neurochemistry. - **Safety:** It's essential to consider current health status, potential side effects, and interactions with other medications when choosing between 5-HTP and L-Tryptophan. - **Consultation with Healthcare Provider:** Especially relevant if you have underlying health conditions or are taking other medications, as to avoid adverse interactions. In summary, whether 5-HTP or L-Tryptophan is better depends on personal health goals, how one's body metabolizes these compounds, and potential side effects or interactions with other substances. It's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen to assess the best option for your specific health needs and circumstances."},{"prompt":"what are the better forms of zinc in supplement form","completion":"When it comes to zinc supplementation, the absorption and bioavailability of zinc can vary based on the form of the supplement. The choice of a zinc supplement often depends on individual health needs, potential dietary restrictions, and sensitivity to different compounds. Here are some commonly regarded forms of zinc that are often highlighted for their bioavailability or specific uses: 1. **Zinc Picolinate:** This form of zinc is chelated to picolinic acid, which can enhance its absorption by the body. Some studies suggest that zinc picolinate may be better absorbed than other forms of zinc, making it a popular choice for those looking to correct deficiency or ensure adequate intake. 2. **Zinc Citrate:** Zinc citrate is zinc combined with citric acid. This form is also well-absorbed and has a relatively mild taste. It's often found in toothpaste and mouthwashes due to its oral health benefits, but it is also available in supplement form. 3. **Zinc Gluconate:** As one of the more common forms of zinc supplements, zinc gluconate is a zinc salt of gluconic acid. It's frequently used in over-the-counter cold remedies and lozenges for its immune support properties. It is generally well-tolerated and considered effective for boosting zinc levels. 4. **Zinc Acetate:** This form is often used in lozenges to reduce the duration of common cold symptoms.

Furthermore, factors like dietary zinc intake, specific health conditions, and overall nutritional status should also be considered when choosing a zinc supplement. As always, consulting with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen is advisable to ensure it aligns with your health needs and goals."},{"prompt":"which is the better form - N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine or L-Tyrosine","completion":"When comparing N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT) and L-Tyrosine, determining which one is \\"better\\" depends on the context of use, individual body chemistry, and what you aim to achieve by taking the supplement. Both are forms of the amino acid tyrosine, which is important for producing neurotransmitters such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters play critical roles in brain function, mood regulation, and response to stress. # L-Tyrosine: L-Tyrosine is the basic form of the amino acid and is found in protein-containing foods as well as available in supplement form. **Pros:** - **Directly Utilized:** It's directly used by the body to produce neurotransmitters and thyroid hormones. - **Research Supported:** There's more research supporting the use of L-Tyrosine for enhancing cognitive performance, especially during stressful conditions or when multitasking. - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Generally, L-Tyrosine supplements tend to be less expensive than NALT. **Cons:** - Some people might have difficulty absorbing L-Tyrosine effectively, especially in larger doses. # N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine (NALT): NALT is a modified form of L-Tyrosine that has an acetyl group attached, which can enhance its solubility and potentially its absorption and bioavailability. **Pros:** - **Solubility:** NALT is more soluble in water, which some suggest might improve its absorption in the body. - **Versatility in Supplement Form:** The increased solubility can make it easier to include in various supplement formulations. **Cons:** - **Bioavailability Questions:** Despite the improved solubility, some research suggests that NALT might not be as efficiently converted back into L-Tyrosine in the body, potentially making it less effective for increasing tyrosine levels. - **Cost:** NALT supplements can be more expensive due to the additional processing involved in binding the acetyl group. # Which Is Better? - **For Cognitive Function and Stress Response:** L-Tyrosine might be more effective based on current research, especially for tasks related to cognitive performance under stress or extended periods of demand, due to better utilization by the body. - **For Solubility and Supplement Formulation:** NALT could be preferred in supplement stacks or formulations that require higher solubility, although the trade-off might be in its conversion efficiency back into L-Tyrosine within the body. Ultimately, the best choice depends on how your body responds to each form, which may require some personal experimentation. Some individuals report noticeable benefits from using NALT, possibly due to its enhanced solubility, while others find L-Tyrosine to be more effective for their needs. Given the variability in bioavailability and individual response, it may be beneficial to try both forms (at different times) to see which one works better for you, always starting with the recommended dosage and adjusting as necessary based on your response. Consulting with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen is always a good practice, especially if you have existing health conditions or are taking other medications."},{"prompt":"Which is better - L-Phenylalanine or DL-Phenylalanine","completion":"L-Phenylalanine and DL-Phenylalanine are related compounds but serve different purposes in the body, and determining which one is \\"better\\" depends on the specific health goals or issues you're addressing. Let's explore both to understand their uses and how they might benefit different conditions. # L-Phenylalanine L-Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid, which means your body cannot produce it on its own, so it must be obtained through your diet. It is found naturally in protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and some nuts and seeds. L-Phenylalanine is a precursor to several important molecules in your body, including tyrosine, which in turn is used to produce neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These neurotransmitters are crucial for regulating mood, alertness, and focus. **Pros:** - Acts as a building block for vital neurotransmitters. - Can boost mood and alleviate symptoms of depression in some cases due to its role in dopamine production. - May help with certain skin conditions when combined with UVA exposure, through its conversion to tyrosine. # DL-Phenylalanine DL-Phenylalanine is a combined form that includes both the natural L-form and the D-form of phenylalanine. The D-phenylalanine is not found in protein foods and is not used by your body to produce proteins or neurotransmitters. However, D-phenylalanine may have analgesic (pain-relieving) and antidepressant effects, possibly through different mechanisms such as inhibiting the breakdown of enkephalins (which are associated with the body's natural pain management system). **Pros:** - May offer unique analgesic properties not found in the L-form, potentially helping with chronic pain management. - Could have an enhanced mood-boosting effect for some individuals due to the combined action of both forms. - Might help with certain types of depression by influencing both neurotransmitter production and pain perception pathways. # Which is Better? **Depends on Your Needs:** - If you're looking to boost neurotransmitter production for improved mood, mental focus, or addressing conditions like depression, **L-Phenylalanine** might be the more straightforward choice due to its direct role as a precursor to tyrosine and subsequently dopamine and other catecholamines. - If you're dealing with chronic pain or looking for a broader spectrum of effects that might include some unique analgesic properties, **DL-Phenylalanine** could offer additional benefits due to the presence of the D-form. **Tolerance and Side Effects:** Both forms are generally well-tolerated but can cause side effects or adverse reactions in certain contexts, such as high doses or sensitive individuals. Always consider potential contraindications, especially if you have specific health conditions (like phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder in which the body can't process phenylalanine) or if you're taking medications that could interact. **Conclusion:** The choice between L-Phenylalanine and DL-Phenylalanine largely hinges on the specific effects you're seeking. It could be beneficial to consult with a healthcare provider or a nutrition specialist to determine which is more suitable for your individual health needs and goals, considering both the potential benefits and risks."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dullsville was known for its extraordinary commitment to being completely, undeniably, and unapologetically boring. So boring, in fact, that the unofficial town motto was, \\"Dullsville: Where Excitement Goes to File Its Taxes.\\" Enter Mr. Overly Enthusiastic. He wasn't just enthusiastic; he was the personification of a triple espresso shot dancing in a field of rainbows while juggling flaming unicorns. His enthusiasm was so powerful, it had its own gravitational pull. Chapter 1: The Arrival As Mr. Overly Enthusiastic entered Dullsville, the town sign sighed heavily. His arrival was marked by a glow on the horizon, a mix of neon enthusiasm and sparkles of pure joy. \\"WHAT A WONDERFULLY AVERAGE DAY!\\" he bellowed, his voice oozing excitement as if he was announcing the discovery of a new planet. Every step he took left a trail of confetti. He walked up to the first person he saw, Mr. Yawns-a-Lot, who was mid-yawn – a hobby he was passionately indifferent about. \\"WHAT A FANTASTIC YAWN! YOU MUST TEACH ME!\\" Mr. Overly Enthusiastic exclaimed, clapping so hard a nearby bird took flight, flustered by the unexpected applause. Chapter 2: The Town Meeting News of Mr. Overly Enthusiastic's arrival spread like a mild rash – uncomfortable, yet not alarming enough to see a doctor. The town's mayor, Miss Monotone, called for an emergency meeting. The room was as silent as a mime's studio apartment, every inhabitant's face showing the emotional range of a teaspoon. \\"We must tone him down,\\" Miss Monotone suggested, her voice flatter than the town's landscape. The townsfolk nodded, their enthusiasm for the task as glaring as a lightbulb under a black cloth. They decided to introduce Mr. Overly Enthusiastic to the town's most boring aspects, hoping it would dim his bright spirit. Chapter 3: The Induction to Mundanity First, they took him to watch paint dry – the town's most popular pastime. Mr. Overly Enthusiastic was mesmerized. \\"LOOK AT IT CHANGE COLOUR! FROM WET-NAVY TO DRY-SLIGHTLY-LESS-WET-NAVY! INCREDIBLE!\\" he cheered, offering a standing ovation to a particularly indifferent wall. Next was the Annual Dullsville Watching Grass Grow Competition. Mr. Overly Enthusiastic was on the edge of his seat, which was impressive considering the seats were designed to be mildly uncomfortable to discourage any form of excitement. \\"THIS IS BETTER THAN BINGE-WATCHING A SHOW ABOUT PAINT DRYING!\\" he exclaimed, popping a party popper with each slight blade wiggle. Chapter 4: The Transformation Something strange happened. Rather than Mr. Overly Enthusiastic becoming more like the folk of Dullsville, the folk of Dullsville became more like Mr. Overly Enthusiastic. Their eyes sparkled with the faint light of interest, a phenomenon not seen since someone accidentally dropped a colorful sock in the town square. Miss Monotone found herself using an exclamation mark for the first time in her life. Mr. Yawns-a-Lot yawned less and smiled more. Even the town sign stopped sighing and instead started to emit a faint glow, proclaiming, \\"Dullsville: Slightly Less Dull Than Yesterday!\\" Chapter 5: The Departure As Mr. Overly Enthusiastic prepared to leave, now bouncing on a pogo stick just because it seemed like a fun way to travel, the townsfolk gathered around. \\"Your enthusiasm is infectious,\\" Miss Monotone said, a small smile playing on her lips. \\"We are slightly less apathetic because of you. Farewell.\\" \\"FANTASTIC! REMEMBER, EVERY DAY IS AN ADVENTURE! EVEN IF IT'S JUST DISCOVERING A NEW WAY TO TIE YOUR SHOELACES!\\" With that, Mr. Overly Enthusiastic pogoed off into the horizon, leaving a trail of slightly less dull people behind him. And in the town of Dullsville, life was forever changed. The Annual Watch Paint Dry event included glitter paint, and the Watching Grass Grow Competition introduced commentary by Mr. Yawns-a-Lot, who turned out to have a hidden talent for making even grass growth sound exciting. As for Mr. Overly Enthusiastic, his next destination was a town known for its aggressive mediocrity. His mission? To sprinkle a little enthusiasm everywhere he went, one overly enthusiastic step at a time."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Needs His Coffee","completion":"Title: Mr. Needs His Coffee and the Quest for the Ultimate Brew In the wide, wild, somewhat wobbly world of Mr. Men, there lived a particularly jittery individual known as Mr. Needs His Coffee. If patience was a virtue, Mr. Needs His Coffee had it not. Especially not before his first cup. Chapter 1: The Catastrophe One bleary-eyed morning, as Mr. Needs His Coffee stumbled groggily towards his sacred coffee machine, he was met with a sight so harrowing, so utterly devastating, that it could only be described as 'the absolute worst thing ever'. His coffee machine, his dear friend and morning ally, was broken. Kaput. Unresponsive. Deader than the ambitions of a slug. \\"NOOOOO!\\" he wailed, his cry echoing through the hills and dales of Mr. Men Land, causing a particularly sensitive Mr. Sensitive to spill his herbal tea in shock. Chapter 2: The Quest Begins Clad in his bathrobe and slippers, armed with nothing but his willpower (and a particularly gnarly case of bedhead), Mr. Needs His Coffee embarked on a noble quest: To find the Ultimate Brew, a mythical coffee rumored to awaken even the dreariest of souls. His first stop was at Mr. Over-Prepared's house. Mr. Over-Prepared had coffee machines, coffee gadgets, coffee paraphernalia of every kind — even a coffee bean that was supposedly blessed by an ancient barista deity. But alas, no Ultimate Brew. \\"This coffee tastes like disappointment,\\" grumbled Mr. Needs His Coffee, pouring the blasphemous liquid onto a sorrowful bush that immediately perked up, bearing caffeinated berries. Chapter 3: The Hipster Barista Next, he braved the wilds of Trendyville and encountered Mr. Barista Hipster, a connoisseur of all things coffee, who could discern the origin of a coffee bean by the mere sound of it being dropped onto a reclaimed wooden table. \\"I seek the Ultimate Brew,\\" declared Mr. Needs His Coffee, with the gravitas of someone ordering a venti quadruple-shot mocha-choco-latte-ya-ya at 8 AM on a Monday. \\"Ah, the Ultimate Brew,\\" mused Mr. Barista Hipster, stroking his artisanally groomed beard. \\"To craft such a beverage, one must first journey to the dark heart of the Caffeinated Jungle and obtain the legendary Single-Origin Bean, grown in the soil of hope and watered by the tears of overworked students.\\" Chapter 4: The Journey to the Caffeinated Jungle Thus, Mr. Needs His Coffee ventured forth, braving caffeine withdrawals that were so intense, they could've powered a small spaceship. He battled through fields of decaf (the horror), climbed the Mountains of Mocha, and sailed the Latte Lagoon. In the depths of the Caffeinated Jungle, he finally found it: the Single-Origin Bean, glowing with an inner light that promised salvation in the form of espresso shots. Chapter 5: The Ultimate Brew With the Single-Origin Bean in hand (well, in a hermetically sealed, temperature-controlled container), Mr. Needs His Coffee returned to Mr. Barista Hipster, who, with an elaborate ceremony that involved coffee siphons, ancient grinders, and a vinyl record of coffee shop sounds, brewed the Ultimate Coffee. As Mr. Needs His Coffee took his first sip, the clouds parted, a choir of cherubs sang, and his bathrobe transformed into a suit of shining armor. He was awake. Truly awake. Chapter 6: Enlightenment The Ultimate Brew didn’t just awaken his body; it awakened his soul. He saw the world in HD, felt like he could run a marathon (or, at the very least, walk to the mailbox without getting winded), and even understood the ending of that one art film everyone pretends to get. But with great power comes great responsibility. Mr. Needs His Coffee realized that the Ultimate Brew was too powerful for daily consumption. He decided to keep it as an emergency reserve, for Mondays and tax season. Epilogue: Back to Basics As life in Mr. Men Land returned to its usual pace, Mr. Needs His Coffee found joy in the simpler cups of coffee, appreciating them for their humble origins and heartwarming warmth. He did, however, keep a detailed map to the Caffeinated Jungle, just in case. And so, Mr. Needs His Coffee learned the true essence of coffee: it's not about the caffeine (okay, it's mostly about the caffeine), but the journey it takes to find that perfect cup. And maybe, just maybe, waking up early enough to enjoy it before the existential dread sets in."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Professional Couch Potato","completion":"Title: Mr. Professional Couch Potato Embarks on the Remote Quest In a snug, cozy corner of Mr. Men Land, where the snack bowls are bottomless and the stretchy pants stretchier, resided our hero for today's utterly pressing narrative: Mr. Professional Couch Potato. The man who could marathon more series than anyone and considered channel surfing an Olympic sport. His couch was his throne, a plush kingdom equipped with gadgets galore, and his scepter? The TV remote. Chapter 1: The Calamity Commences One fateful afternoon, as Mr. Professional Couch Potato was deep into his 8th consecutive hour of \\"World's Most Extreme Knitting Championships,\\" tragedy struck. His remote control, in a rebellious act of defiance, vanished. Poof. Gone. Disappeared faster than his motivation to stand up. \\"DAGNABBIT!\\" cried Mr. Professional Couch Potato, launching a search party from his couch cushion fortresses to the treacherous terrain under the sofa. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. It was as if the remote had sprouted legs and strolled off. Chapter 2: The Quest for the Elusive Clicker Realizing the gravity of the situation (and that the next episode of \\"Extreme Knitting\\" was starting), Mr. Professional Couch Potato did what any reasonable man entangled in a crisis would do. He ordered a new remote. But, shipping would take 3-5 business days. Unacceptable. Thus began the epic quest for the Elusive Clicker, a journey that would require him to venture further than the refrigerator, farther even than the dreaded Mailbox Beyond the Porch. Chapter 3: Allies Assemble First, he enlisted the help of his trusty sidekick, Sir Sits-a-lot, the lazy Labrador who mastered the art of dozing mid-stretch. Together, they journeyed to the kitchen (a whole 12 steps!), where they sought wisdom from Madame Microwave, who simply beeped enigmatically in response. Next, they consulted with Lady Lampshade, who illuminated nothing useful but offered a comforting glow. Their quest was proving fruitier than a soap opera plot twist. Chapter 4: The Great Outdoor Expedition Realizing that his quest required drastic measures, Mr. Professional Couch Potato did the unthinkable. He ventured... outside. *Gasp!* Clad in his finest bathrobe and fluffy slippers, Mr. Professional Couch Potato braved the sunlight, which he had believed was a myth propagated by morning people. The outdoors was wild, unpredictable, and had significantly fewer snack options. He encountered Ms. Jog-a-lot, who offered tips on endurance (which he interpreted as advice for binge-watching). He then met with the Wise Old Bench-Sitter, who imparted profound wisdom: \\"Sometimes, what you seek is right where you least want to look.\\" Chapter 5: The Revelation Inspired by the cryptic advice, Mr. Professional Couch Potato returned to his indoor kingdom and faced his greatest fear: cleaning. With the courage of a thousand lazy Sundays, he lifted cushions, vacuumed centuries' worth of snack remnants, and delved into the abyss below the couch. There, amongst the lost civilisations of popcorn and a treasure trove of missing socks, he found it. The Elusive Clicker, gleaming like Excalibur in a sunbeam that had dared penetrate the fortress of curtains. Chapter 6: The Triumphant Return Remote in hand, Mr. Professional Couch Potato resumed his rightful place upon his couch, a hero returned from his odyssey. He was changed, marked by the trials he endured, wiser in the ways of the world beyond the screen. The TV flickered to life, and the sweet sounds of \\"Extreme Knitting\\" filled the room. Mr. Professional Couch Potato smiled, a conqueror victorious, basking in the glow of his triumph and the TV screen. Epilogue: The Legacy Henceforth, Mr. Professional Couch Potato was no longer just a couch potato. He was Mr. Professional Couch Potato the Brave, the Bold, the Slightly More Hygienic. Legends of his quest were told in whispers across Mr. Men Land, inspiring countless others to embark on their quests... Mostly to find the remote, but every now and then, to venture to the fridge and beyond. And so, within the cozy confines of his living room, Mr. Professional Couch Potato sat, forever ready for the next episode, the next quest, the next adventure. But maybe, just maybe, after one more episode."},{"prompt":"Mr. Walking Liability","completion":"**Title: Mr. Walking Liability and the Catastrophically Curious Day** In the ledgers of the insurance companies of Mr. Men Land, there was one name that caused accountants to shudder, underwriters to faint, and paperwork to spontaneously combust: Mr. Walking Liability. Unlike his peers, Mr. Worry and Mr. Bump, whose existential angst and accidental mishaps were manageable, Mr. Walking Liability elevated disaster to an art form. His life was a series of unfortunate events narrated by the Greek chorus of \\"I'm sorry!\\" and \\"Oops!\\" **Chapter 1: The Beginning of a Very Bad Day** It was a morning so beautiful, so utterly devoid of chaos, that Mr. Walking Liability felt a tad nervous. He side-eyed his cereal, suspicious of its calmness, before deciding to skip breakfast. After all, who knew what havoc he could wreak with a spoon? Before stepping outside, he took a deep breath, strapped on his helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, and bubble-wrapped his entire home. Just to be safe. The neighborhood sighed collectively. \\"Here goes,\\" he whispered to himself, stepping outside. **Chapter 2: The Domino Effect** His first interaction was with Mrs. Neatly, who was painting her fence. Spotting Mr. Walking Liability, she instinctively hid her paint cans. But it was too late: a mere greeting from Mr. Walking Liability sent a rogue soccer ball rolling, which nudged a skateboard, which startled a cat, leading to a chain reaction that ended with Mr. Walking Liability covered in paint, and Mrs. Neatly's previously white cat now a vibrant shade of neon pink. \\"I just wanted to say 'good morning,'\\" Mr. Walking Liability mumbled, extricating himself from the wreckage. **Chapter 3: The Office Calamity** Undeterred, Mr. Walking Liability made his way to work. The office, having received a warning of his approach, had taken precautions: all computers were encased in bubble wrap, and the coffee machine was hidden. Yet, within minutes of his arrival, a misstep led to a stumble, which led to an impromptu indoor fountain springing forth from the office water cooler. As documents floated by and colleagues clung to their desks like shipwreck survivors, Mr. Walking Liability could only offer a weak, \\"Erm, does anyone have a towel?\\" **Chapter 4: The Dreaded Presentation** The climax of Mr. Walking Liability's day was his presentation to the board of directors. Armed with only a pointer and his catastrophic luck, he began. Mid-sentence, his pointer activated the sprinkler system, causing chaos, soggy notes, and one very startled executive who, until that moment, had been napping. The presentation, though waterlogged, was declared \\"unforgettable\\" and \\"groundbreaking.\\" Mainly because it broke the projector and flooded the ground. **Chapter 5: The Revelation** Sitting amid the ruins of what was supposed to be a routine day, Mr. Walking Liability had an epiphany. Perhaps his talent for chaos could be used for good. With great power, comes great... insurance premiums, but also, opportunity. **Chapter 6: The Turnaround** Starting small, Mr. Walking Liability volunteered for the demolition crew, where his knack for destruction was not only appreciated but celebrated. Buildings scheduled for teardown merely required him to walk by. He became a legend, the man who could demolish with a sneeze, the whisperer of wrecking balls. His crowning achievement was the imploding of an old tower. Spectators watched from a safe distance as Mr. Walking Liability, donned in his finest bubble wrap suit, approached the tower. A trip, a stumble, and voilà, the tower elegantly collapsed into a pile of dust. He received a standing ovation. **Epilogue: The Legend** Mr. Walking Liability found his calling in controlled chaos. His days of unintentional disasters were (mostly) behind him, and he became a beloved figure in Mr. Men Land, teaching young Mr. and Little Misses the value of embracing one's quirks. And while insurance companies still blanched at the mention of his name, they couldn't deny that Mr. Walking Liability had finally made a name for himself, not as a disaster, but as a hero of demolition. The moral of this tale? Even the greatest liabilities, with the right perspective, can become invaluable assets."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","completion":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic","completion":"Ethereal Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Beauty Portrait | Sheer Elegance & Floral Majesty | Versatile Art for Mugs, Tees, and Paintings"},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Ethereal Blossom Embrace | Ultra-Realistic Beauty Portrait | Sheer Elegance &amp; Floral Majesty | Versatile Art for Mugs, Tees, and Paintings.

Mr. Walking Allergy Season was a curious creature, with a perpetually red nose not unlike the hue of a clown’s, eyes that watered so much you'd mistake him for a walking watering can, and an unending repertoire of sneezes that came in all rhythms and melodies. It was like living in a perpetual state of spring, except for him, every season was allergy season. His house, painted in a vibrant shade of pollen yellow (which, in hindsight, wasn’t the best of choices), was filled with tissues. Not just any tissues, though. Oh no. Mr. Walking Allergy Season, in his endless wisdom, had invested in turbo-charged, anti-gravity tissues that would zoom towards him at the first sound of a sneeze. It sounds convenient, right? Except, these tissues had a bit of a navigation problem and would often slap him in the face or take scenic routes around his home before reaching him. One day, determined to overcome his sniffly disposition, Mr. Walking Allergy Season decided to throw an outdoor garden party. Yes, in the middle of spring. The invitations were sent out on pollen-coated paper (because, let’s face it, subtlety was not Mr. Walking Allergy Season’s strong suit). Come the day of the party, Mr. Walking Allergy Season had prepared what can only be described as the most allergy-inducing menu ever conceived. Dishes were seasoned with freshly cut grass, beverages were infused with pollen extracts, and the pièce de résistance was a cake decorated with an assortment of real flowers and a side of dust mites. Guests began to arrive, each more bewildered by the menu but too polite to say anything. Little Miss Tissue, Mr. Sneeze’s cousin twice removed, was in her element, distributing tissues like they were going out of style. As the party progressed, so did the cacophony of sneezes, sniffles, and the occasional nasal honk, creating a symphony that could only be described as a cross between a whale's call and experimental jazz. Mr. Walking Allergy Season, ever the gracious host, sneezed with such gusto that he accidentally launched the flower-decorated cake into the stratosphere, creating what would later be referred to as the Sneezeville Satellite. Just when the guests thought they had seen it all, Mr. Walking Allergy Season unveiled his greatest surprise - a dance floor coated in layers of pollen. The idea was to dance the allergies away, a concept so outlandishly hilarious that even the trees around them seemed to quiver in anticipation (or maybe that was just the breeze). As the night dwindled down and the guests departed, each sneezing their goodbyes, Mr. Walking Allergy Season stood amidst his pollen-coated paradise, a wide, satisfied smile plastered across his face. He had set out to embrace his allergy-filled existence and, in doing so, brought Sneezeville closer together through laughter, dance, and an ungodly amount of tissues. And so, the legend of Mr. Walking Allergy Season lived on, a testament to the hilarity and resilience of embracing one’s quirks, no matter how sniffly or sneezy they might be."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Walking Allergy Season","completion":"**(Title)** # Mr. Walking Allergy Season --- Once upon a time, in a land where every sneeze echoed like a megaphone gone mad, there lived a peculiar fellow named Mr. Walking Allergy Season. Now, don't mistake him for a season you can mark on your calendar - no, he was not bound by the mere laws of spring or autumn. Mr. Walking Allergy Season was an entire allergy season on two legs, wreaking havoc twelve months a year, come rain or shine. --- **Chapter 1: Introductions of the Sniffly Kind** Mr. Walking Allergy Season lived in Pollenville, the only place where the trees sneezed back. You see, everyone in Pollenville knew when Mr. Walking Allergy Season was coming - not by looking at their calendars, but by the symphony of sneezes and the sudden need to invest in tissue stock. Imagine a man whose mere presence could turn a serene park into a pollen apocalypse. Flowers wilted, bees wore tiny gas masks, and the grass lay flat in defeat whenever he strolled by. He didn't walk; he ambled, leaving a trail of sniffles, sneezles, and wheezes in his wake. --- **Chapter 2: A Nose That Could Guide Ships Ashore** What set Mr. Walking Allergy Season apart, aside from his ability to communicate exclusively in sneezes at social gatherings, was his nose. It was not just any nose. It was a marvel of the natural world, a beacon that could guide ships ashore if only it didn't change direction with every new scent. His nose, red and shiny from perpetual runniness, was the bane of handkerchief manufacturers everywhere – for no fabric could contain its might. Legend had it, his nostrils could predict an allergy season worse than groundhogs could predict spring. --- **Chapter 3: The Quest for the Allergy-Free Zone** One day, amidst a particularly violent sneeze that registered on the Richter scale, Mr. Walking Allergy Season had an epiphany. Tired of being the harbinger of nasal doom, he decided to embark on a quest for the mythical Allergy-Free Zone, a place whispered about in allergen circles as the Promised Land where one could breathe freely. Armed with an arsenal of nasal sprays, antihistamines, and a pocketful of dreams, Mr. Walking Allergy Season set off. His journey was fraught with peril - fields of flowers launched pollen assaults, rogue cats tried to rub against his legs (he was terribly allergic to cats), and once, he accidentally wandered into a perfume factory, which, quite frankly, is a whole story on its own. --- **Chapter 4: The Allergy-Free Zone** After many sneezes and a journey that even the most stalwart of tissues couldn't withstand, Mr. Walking Allergy Season finally stumbled upon the Allergy-Free Zone. It was...underwhelming. A tiny, nondescript patch of land with absolutely nothing growing on it. Not a single blade of grass dared to venture forth. But, to Mr. Walking Allergy Season's nose, it was paradise. For the first time in his life, he inhaled deeply without fear of reprisal from his respiratory system. He was so overwhelmed with emotion, he almost sneezed – but didn't. That was when he laughed. He laughed so hard, he cried, and then he sneezed because, well, it’s hard to change who you are completely. --- **Chapter 5: Home Sweet Pollen-Filled Home** The Allergy-Free Zone might have been free of allergens, but it was also free of life, character, and, unfortunately, the nearest pharmacy. With a sigh, Mr. Walking Allergy Season realized that while his quest had brought him peace of nose, it had also brought him peace of mind. He missed Pollenville, with all its sneezes and wheezes. So, he returned home, a hero, hailed not just for his epic quest, but because he was, inadvertently, a one-man pollen forecast. Pollenville embraced him, allergies and all. Because if there’s one thing about allergies, they’re nothing to sneeze at. Well, actually, they are. But not in Pollenville. --- **Epilogue: Bless You, Mr. Walking Allergy Season** And so, life in Pollenville returned to normal. Mr. Walking Allergy Season resumed his daily walks, leaving behind a wake of sneezes, sniffles, and a town that had learned to love him, just the way he was - a walking, talking, sneezing embodiment of allergy season. In the end, Mr. Walking Allergy Season didn't just change with the seasons; he changed the hearts of those around him through the sheer force of his sneezes. Bless you, Mr. Walking Allergy Season. Keep those tissues handy. --- And thus concludes the overly funny, super hilarious tale of Mr. Walking Allergy Season. Because, in the grand scheme of things, isn't life just one big allergy season we’re all navigating through, one sneeze at a time?"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His residence, a house that looked like a before photo in a home insurance nightmare, stood precariously on what could be described as the only plot of land that dared to host it. Mr. Human Disaster Area, who could trip over a shadow and send a whole town into a blackout, woke up with an optimistic grin. The kind of grin that warned the universe to hold onto its cosmic hat. Today, he decided, was a good day to make toast. The kind of toast that stories—and fire brigades—are made of. # Chapter 2: The Toast Odyssey Armed with a toaster he personally rescued from a yard sale labeled \\"For Daredevils Only,\\" Mr. Human Disaster Area embarked on his odyssey to create the perfect toast. As he lowered the bread into the metallic jaws of destiny, little did he know he was about to invent a new kind of indoor fireworks. Seconds later, his kitchen was a light show rivaling the Northern Lights, if the Northern Lights smelled like burnt toast and existential regret. # Chapter 3: A Brush with Hygiene Recovering from his culinary misadventure, Mr. Human Disaster Area realized he was running late. It was time to adopt the persona of Mr. Rushed and Wildly Inefficient. Deciding against combing his hair, after the last incident that involved a comb, three emergency responders, and an unexpected visit from a curious bear, he opted for toothpaste. In a universe where cause and effect were on speaking terms, squeezing a tube of toothpaste wouldn’t end in the bathroom looking like a scene from a toothpaste factory explosion. Today, however, the universe was on voicemail. # Chapter 4: The Great Outdoors Leaving his abode, Mr. Human Disaster Area decided to take a walk. Nature, after all, had not yet filed a restraining order against him. As he strolled, birds took off in alarm, squirrels halted their chatter, and even the trees seemed to lean away, wishing they could find their roots and move. His walk brought him to a garden party, where he thought, what could possibly go wrong? # Chapter 5: Party Faux Pas Upon Mr. Human Disaster Area's arrival, the garden party was in full swing. By the time he left, it was swinging from emergency services choppers, as partygoers recounted tales of a man who could turn a simple \\"Hello\\" into a series of events needing insurance claims. In his defense, Mr. Human Disaster Area had tried to help. However, when he offered to open a bottle of champagne, nobody anticipated the cork's trajectory to perfectly intersect with the only cake impressively shaped like Nonsenseland itself. # Chapter 6: Reflections and Reverberations As dusk fell on Nonsenseland, Mr. Human Disaster Area sat atop his home's uniquely slanting roof. His legs dangled as he pondered over the day—his mind a mix of whimsy and wonder at how one individual could inadvertently sow chaos with the efficiency of a buttered cat always landing on its feet, but in disaster terms. He looked out over a town that twinkled with lights, a testament to the resilience of Nonsenseland's electricians, and he smiled. For in Nonsenseland, disasters weren't merely accidents; they were anecdotes in the making. And Mr. Human Disaster Area? Well, he was the most beloved chapter yet unwritten."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Personal Space Invader","completion":"Title: Mr. Personal Space Invader **Chapter 1: Welcome to Too-Close Ville** In the land of Distant Dales, far away from the bustling life of Hugton and the ever-congested streets of Kissburg, there was a little unheard-of place called Too-Close Ville. It was here that Mr. Personal Space Invader decided to set up residence, much to the dismay of the local inhabitants. Mr. Personal Space Invader was not your average Mister. With a smile as wide as a mile and a sense of personal space that would make a sardine feel claustrophobic, he took the phrase \\"up close and personal\\" to a whole new level. **Chapter 2: The Whispering Walrus** Our story begins on a sunny Tuesday when Mr. Personal Space Invader met Mr. Shy at the local coffee shop, \\"The Whispering Walrus.\\" The name was quite ironic because once Mr. Personal Space Invader got going, there was nothing whispering about it. \\"HELLO, MR. SHY!\\" bellowed Mr. Personal Space Invader, his face barely an inch away from Mr. Shy's, who at this point had contorted his body into a shape that would have made a pretzel jealous, just to get some breathing room. “I-I-I’m fine, thank you,” stuttered Mr. Shy, who wasn’t accustomed to having a conversation inside what he considered his dental cavity. The interaction was cut short when Mr. Shy, in a move that would contribute to the future “Anti-Gravity Yoga” craze, managed to levitate himself away using only the power of discomfort. **Chapter 3: The Hugathon Contest** The annual Too-Close Ville \\"Hugathon\\" was around the corner, and Mr. Personal Space Invader was in his element. The contest was simple: whoever held a hug the longest won a year's supply of breath mints—a prize Mr. Personal Space Invader had won three years running, perhaps due to the powerful aroma of onions and dreams that emanated from him, making competitors yield for fresh air. This year, however, his main competitor was Mr. Sweaty, a newcomer with a perspiration problem that made rain look like a mild drizzle. The stage was set for the ultimate showdown of closeness versus clamminess. **Chapter 4: The Great Squish** On the day of the Hugathon, the air was thick with anticipation (and a smidge of body odor). Mr. Personal Space Invader and Mr. Sweaty stood at opposite ends of the stage, eyeing each other as if they were about to engage in a gladiatorial embrace. The countdown began, and they lunged at each other like star-crossed lovers, if the lovers had been onions and a gym sock. The hug was so intense that audience members reported seeing ripples in the fabric of space and time around them. But then, something unexpected happened—Mr. Sweaty began to slip from Mr. Personal Space Invader's grasp due to his, well, sweatiness. In a desperate move, Mr. Personal Space Invader tightened his embrace, leading to a monumental squish sound heard throughout Too-Close Ville. **Chapter 5: Personal Space and the Space in Between** In the end, they declared the contest a tie, for no one had the heart (or the measuring tape) to determine the degree of closeness achieved that day. Mr. Personal Space Invader and Mr. Sweaty, in a show of sportsmanship and slightly slippery camaraderie, shared the prize of breath mints. It was then that Mr. Personal Space Invader had a revelation. Perhaps, he thought, there's more to life than invading personal bubbles. Maybe, just maybe, the space in between was for sharing, not just closing. **Epilogue: A New Chapter** Mr. Personal Space Invader became a changed Mister. He founded \\"The Society of Reasonable Distances,\\" and with the help of Mr. Shy, Mr. Sweaty, and a newfound respect for boundaries, they spread the message: \\"Close Enough to Care, Far Enough to Breathe.\\" And so, Too-Close Ville remained the same, yet entirely different. Where once was a land dreaded for its proximity, there stood a community united by the right amount of space—the perfect blend of near and far—where everyone could happily say, “This is close enough.” The end."},{"prompt":"Alternate 2022 : Biden replaces Breyer with a 34-year old prodigy justice","completion":"Given this alternate scenario for 2022, where President Joe Biden successfully appoints a 34-year-old prodigy to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, there would be significant short-term and long-term implications, not just for the Court, but for the political landscape in the United States as well. Let's explore how this event could reshape the legal, political, and social fabric of the country: # Immediate Aftermath and Confirmation 1. **Public Reaction:** There would likely be a mixed reaction from the public. Progressives might celebrate the move as a bold step towards ensuring a long-term liberal presence on the Court. Conservatives, however, would probably be alarmed over the potential for decades of influence from a young, progressive justice. 2. **Senate Confirmation:** Given the young age and potentially less extensive track record of the nominee, the Senate confirmation hearings would be intensely scrutinized. Every aspect of the nominee's career, writings, and public statements would be meticulously examined. Assuming the nominee makes it through the confirmation process, it would likely be along strict partisan lines, emphasizing the deep political divides in the country. # Long-term Legal Implications 1. **Judicial Influence:** Having a justice in their mid-30s could mean a tenure on the Supreme Court lasting 40 years or more. This would allow for an unprecedented level of influence over American law and society, shaping major legal decisions potentially until the 2060s. 2. **Legal Philosophies:** The young justice would have the opportunity to craft and evolve their legal philosophies over the decades, possibly even shifting the ideological balance of the Court over time. Their influence could extend to critical issues such as climate change, technology and privacy rights, social justice, and more. 3. **Mentorship and Leadership:** Over time, this justice could become a pivotal leader and mentor on the Court, guiding new appointees and shaping the direction of the judiciary. # Political and Social Impact 1. **Political Strategy:** The appointment might catalyze a reevaluation of political strategies regarding the judiciary. Both parties might prioritize even younger nominees, altering the traditional profile of a Supreme Court justice. 2. **Public Perception of the Judiciary:** Younger demographics might feel more represented or see the Court as more modern and forward-thinking. However, there could also be concerns about the wisdom and experience traditionally associated with Supreme Court justices. 3. **Election Implications:** In the immediate term and beyond, this appointment could become a rallying point in electoral politics, influencing voter turnout and campaign strategies. The long-term presence of a young, progressive justice could also shape the platforms and priorities of the Democratic Party. # Conclusion The appointment of a 34-year-old justice would be a historic and transformative event for the U.S. Supreme Court, with the potential to reshape American law and politics for generations. While it would bring fresh perspectives and potentially more progressive rulings, it would also likely fuel ongoing debates about the Court's role, its impartiality, and the ever-intensifying political battles over its composition."},{"prompt":"Born in 1988. Life expectancy of 108.","completion":"A person born in 1988 with a life expectancy of 108 would live until the year 2096. This long lifespan, significantly above the current global average, suggests advancements in healthcare, lifestyle, and possibly genetic or technological enhancements that could emerge over their lifetime.

The lifestyle, technological advancements, medical care, and global environmental and social shifts they experience would be profound. This scenario also invites reflection on the societal, ethical, and personal implications of significantly extended life expectancies, from the sustainability of resources to the quality of life in advanced age."},{"prompt":"Alternate 2022 : Biden replaces Breyer with a 34-year old prodigy justice. Born 1988. Partisan liberal jurist, civil libertarian","completion":"In this alternate 2022 scenario, President Joe Biden nominates a 34-year-old prodigy justice, born in 1988, to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Stephen Breyer. This bold move, nominating a distinctly partisan liberal jurist with a strong civil libertarian stance, would trigger a wide array of reactions and consequences in both the short and long term. Here, we explore the ramifications of such an appointment. # Immediate Political and Public Reaction 1. **Fierce Partisan Debate:** The nomination would almost certainly spark a heated debate in the Senate and among the public. Republicans would likely argue that the nominee's age and pronounced liberal views make them too inexperienced and ideologically biased for a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court. 2. **Democratic Support:** Conversely, many Democrats and liberal advocacy groups would likely herald the nomination as a progressive and strategic move to secure the Court's future, emphasizing the nominee's prodigious legal talent and commitment to civil liberties. 3. **Public Interest:** The nomination of a young, ideologically distinct justice could engage younger demographics in discussions about the Supreme Court's role, particularly on issues relevant to them such as digital privacy, climate change, and social justice. # Confirmation Process 1. **Intense Scrutiny:** The Senate hearings for the nominee would be under intense scrutiny, focusing on their past writings, court decisions (if applicable), and public statements. Given their youth, the substantive depth and ideological direction of their body of work would be key points of contention. 2. **Historic Nature:** Should the nominee be confirmed, it would be historical not only due to their age but also their openly partisan stance. It could fundamentally alter the traditional expectations for Supreme Court nominees to present as neutral arbiters of the law. # Implications for the Supreme Court and the Law 1. **Long-term Influence:** Given the potential for a tenure of 50 years or more, this justice could significantly influence American jurisprudence across generations, shaping major legal precedents, especially in areas like civil rights, digital privacy, and perhaps new, emerging legal challenges. 2. **Shifting Dynamics:** The addition of a young, staunchly liberal and civil libertarian justice could shift the balance of the Court, affecting its decisions on critical issues. Over time, as other justices retire or pass away, the Biden appointee's legal philosophy and leadership could attract or inspire other likeminded justices, further solidifying a liberal majority. 3. **Civil Liberties Focus:** Their civil libertarian views could lead to landmark rulings enhancing protections for individual liberties, likely siding with broader interpretations of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments, among others, in cases involving speech, privacy, and equality. # Broader Political and Social Impact 1. **Future Nominations:** This could set a precedent for future Presidents to nominate younger justices with clear ideological leanings, potentially increasing the polarization of the Court. 2. **Legislative and Executive Caution:** Knowing the Court's composition, Congress and the President might approach legislation and executive actions with an eye towards how this justice might influence its constitutionality, possibly deterring attempts to roll back civil liberties. 3. **Public Engagement:** Lastly, the energy and ideals of a young justice could further politicize the Court in the short term but also invigorate public engagement with the judiciary, inspiring a new generation to pursue legal careers or activism focused on civil liberties and rights. In conclusion, this scenario would represent a bold departure from tradition, with far-reaching implications for American law, politics, and society. While controversial, the appointment of a young, partisan liberal jurist with a civil libertarian outlook could be seen as a strategic move to ensure a long-term progressive influence on the Supreme Court, amidst an era of significant social and technological change."},{"prompt":"confirmed 50 VP-50.","completion":"In circumstances where the U.S. Senate confirms a Supreme Court nominee with a vote of 50-yes to 50-no, under the current rules and assuming the vice president is of the party pushing the nomination through, the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote. If the confirmation scenario you're mentioning occurred under the Administration of a Democratic President like Joe Biden, and with the Senate split 50-50 between the two parties, the Vice President (as of my last update, Kamala Harris) would have the authority to cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of the nominee. This scenario would mark a highly contentious and polarized confirmation process, reflecting deep divisions not only within the Senate but likely across the broader American public as well. Confirmations of Supreme Court justices are significant events, influencing the direction of American jurisprudence for decades. The confirmation of a young, ideologically committed justice under such circumstances would underscore the stakes involved in Supreme Court appointments in the current political climate. # Implications: 1. **Political Repercussions:** Utilizing the Vice President to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in a 50-50 Senate would likely intensify partisan divisions and could have lasting implications for Senate norms and procedures. It might also influence future judicial nominations, potentially leading to more ideologically extreme nominees if parties feel emboldened by such a precedent. 2. **Impact on the Court:** The Supreme Court prides itself on being above politics, but polarized confirmation processes can affect public perception of the Court's impartiality. The legitimacy and authority of the Court could be challenged in public debates, potentially affecting how its decisions are received. 3. **Election Dynamics:** The high-stakes confirmation could become a pivotal issue in subsequent elections, particularly in Senate races. Senators who voted on the nominee might face electoral challenges based on their confirmation vote, and the issue could energize voters on both sides of the political spectrum. 4. **Legislative Strategy:** Knowing that the Vice President can break ties in this manner might encourage or dissuade certain legislative or nomination strategies, especially in closely divided Senates. Parties may pursue more aggressive agendas, knowing that a tie vote is not an insurmountable barrier. # Historical Context: While Vice Presidents have cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate before, including on crucial legislation and procedural matters, using this power for a Supreme Court confirmation highlights the rarity and significance of such a decision. It underscores the highly polarized nature of contemporary American politics and the importance of the Supreme Court in deciding critical legal and constitutional questions."},{"prompt":"The following year, Sotomayor retires, to be replaced with a similar one, age 36.","completion":"If Justice Sonia Sotomayor were to retire the following year after the appointment of a 34-year-old justice and President Biden then successfully appoints another young, prodigious justice at the age of 36, this would underscore a strategic transformation of the U.S. Supreme Court with far-reaching implications. Here's a speculative look at how this scenario could unfold and its potential impacts: # Immediate Reactions and Confirmation 1. **Public and Political Reaction:** The nomination of another young, potentially partisan liberal justice would likely intensify the political and public discourse around Supreme Court appointments. With two extremely young justices appointed back-to-back, debates would center on the long-term ideological shaping of the Court and the potential for these justices to influence American jurisprudence for decades. 2. **Senate Dynamics:** Assuming the Senate composition remains closely divided, the confirmation process could be highly contentious. If the first confirmation was seen as a benchmark, this second nomination might either follow the same contentious but ultimately successful path or face even tougher scrutiny from senators wary of significantly tipping the ideological balance of the Court. # Strategic Reshaping of the Court 1. **Long-Term Liberal Influence:** With two justices in their mid-30s appointed in consecutive years, President Biden would effectively anchor the liberal wing of the Court for potentially 40-50 years, assuming normal life expectancies and no unforeseen resignations. This could profoundly influence major legal precedents and the direction of American law on issues like civil liberties, environmental regulations, reproductive rights, and healthcare. 2. **Reaction from Conservative Circles:** These appointments could instigate a strategic response from conservative politicians and jurists, potentially influencing the selection and grooming of conservative judicial candidates for other federal court positions or future Supreme Court vacancies. 3. **Implications for Future Nominations:** The precedent of nominating significantly younger justices might encourage future presidents to consider younger nominees to ensure a long-term impact on the Court’s composition, possibly also affecting the qualifications and experience considered typical for a Supreme Court justice. # Legal and Societal Implications 1. **Judicial Philosophy and Leadership:** The introduction of younger justices might bring fresh perspectives and potentially more progressive interpretations of the Constitution to the Court's deliberations. This could also affect the internal dynamics of the Court, with younger justices possibly assuming leadership roles in certain legal domains sooner in their tenures. 2. **Public Engagement and Perception:** The appointments could galvanize public interest in the Supreme Court, particularly among younger Americans who may feel their values and concerns are more directly represented. However, it could also lead to increased scrutiny and politicization of the Court, with the long-term implications on the Court’s perceived legitimacy and independence becoming critical points of concern. 3. **Influence on Social and Legal Norms:** With decades to influence landmark decisions, these justices could play pivotal roles in shaping areas like tech privacy, climate change regulations, and evolving societal issues not yet foreseen. Their decisions would likely resonate through American law and society, affecting generations. # Conclusion The strategic replacement of Justice Sonia Sotomayor with another young, potentially liberal justice, following a similarly youthful and precedent-setting appointment, could be a watershed moment for the U.S. Supreme Court. Such moves would not only reflect and potentially accelerate shifts in legal philosophies and the political landscape of judicial appointments but also herald significant long-term transformations in American legal and societal norms."},{"prompt":"Both justices are born to live to 130.","completion":"Imagining a scenario in which both young justices appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court are predicted to live to the age of 130 considerably amplifies the future impact they could have on the court and on American jurisprudence. While the notion of living to 130 extends well into the realm of speculative fiction based on our current medical and technological knowledge, let's explore the potential implications of such unprecedented longevity for justices and the broader judicial system, within the bounds of this speculative framework: # Judicial Tenure and Influence 1. **Extended Tenures:** These justices could serve on the Supreme Court for nearly a century, an unprecedented duration that would allow them to influence multiple generations of American law and policy. Their decisions could shape major legal precedents across a wide range of issues, potentially including emerging areas of law related to technological advancements, environmental changes, and shifts in social norms. 2. **Evolution of Legal Philosophy:** Given their extended tenures, these justices would have the opportunity to evolve their legal philosophies substantially over time. They might initially be perceived as ideologically liberal, but their views could shift in response to societal changes, personal growth, or emerging legal challenges, making their long-term impact difficult to predict. # Impact on the Supreme Court and Judicial Appointments 1. **Stability vs. Stagnation:** Having justices serve for such extended periods could potentially bring a new level of stability to the Court’s ideological balance. However, it could also lead to criticisms of stagnation, with calls for mechanisms to ensure the Court evolves along with society. 2. **Revisiting Appointment and Tenure Rules:** This unprecedented scenario could prompt serious discussions about the nature of lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court. It might fuel debates on potential reforms, such as fixed terms for justices or mandatory retirement ages, to ensure the Court regularly receives new perspectives. # Legal, Political, and Social Implications 1. **Policy Planning and Predictability:** Knowing the potential for incredibly long tenures of certain justices could influence how legislators, administrations, and advocacy groups plan their strategic initiatives, particularly in aligning with or countering the anticipated judicial leanings. 2. **Generational Influence:** These justices would not only impact the lives of the contemporaries who witnessed their appointments but also the lives of several future generations. This could lead to a significant generational legacy, with their rulings influencing the foundational legal principles for Americans not yet born at the time of their appointment. 3. **Advancements and Challenges:** As society, technology, and medical understanding advance, these justices would need to adapt to unprecedented ethical, legal, and constitutional challenges. Their prolonged interaction with evolving legal landscapes might make them uniquely equipped to deal with complex future issues, combining decades of legal experience with adaptability to change. # Speculative Considerations - **Mental and Physical Health:** The assumption of such longevity would likely depend on significant advancements in healthcare, potentially including breakthroughs in anti-aging treatments, cognitive enhancement, and disease prevention. The capacity of these justices to serve effectively would depend not just on lifespan but on maintaining high levels of cognitive and physical health. - **Public Perception:** Over time, public perception of these justices and their role in American democracy could fluctuate dramatically. Initially celebrated for their youth and potential, they could later face scrutiny for holding their positions too long, particularly if their decisions fall out of step with evolving societal values. This speculative exploration underscores the profound potential impacts of extending human life—and, by extension, judicial tenures—far beyond current norms. While it raises intriguing possibilities for the future of the judiciary, it also highlights the importance of adaptability, both for individuals and institutions, in responding to unforeseen societal and technological changes."},{"prompt":"It is a reaction to RBG's death and replacement.","completion":"The nomination and confirmation of two prodigiously young Supreme Court justices to potentially serve for nearly a century each, in part as a reaction to the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her swift replacement by a conservative justice, can be seen as a strategic and transformative approach aimed at reshaping the future of the U.S. Supreme Court for generations. This context illuminates several dimensions of political strategy, judicial philosophy, and the evolving nature of the Court within American democracy. Let's delve deeper into the implications and motivations behind such decisions, grounded in this particular historical context: # Strategic Judicial Rebalancing 1. **Long-term Liberal Presence:** The death of Justice Ginsburg and her replacement under the Trump administration represented a significant rightward shift in the Court’s balance. In response, appointing significantly younger justices with liberal leanings could be seen as a strategic move to ensure a long-term liberal presence on the Court, countering recent conservative gains. 2. **Legacy and Influence:** Ginsburg was a towering figure in the fight for women's rights and gender equality, and her death marked the end of an era. By choosing young, potentially progressive justices, the administration might aim to secure a lasting legacy and influence on issues Ginsburg championed, as well as broader social justice and civil liberties concerns. 3. **Political Response:** The rapid replacement of Ginsburg reflected deep political divisions and the highly charged nature of Supreme Court nominations. By nominating prodigiously young liberals, the administration could be signaling a bold political maneuver aimed at fundamentally altering the Court’s trajectory in the long term. # Judicial Philosophy and Evolution 1. **Ideological Balancing:** Given the conservative tilt of the Court following Ginsburg's replacement, young liberal justices could provide a crucial ideological balance. Over decades, this balance might evolve with societal changes, potentially keeping the Court more in step with public sentiment. 2. **Adapting to Future Challenges:** Issues like technology, environmental crises, and bioethics are likely to pose significant legal challenges in the coming years. Young justices, especially those with a civil libertarian bend, could bring forward-thinking perspectives to these challenges, influenced by the legacy of justices like Ginsburg. # Institutional and Societal Implications 1. **Court Legitimacy and Public Trust:** Following the contentious circumstances surrounding Ginsburg’s replacement, the move to appoint such young justices might initially spark debate over court-packing and the politicization of the Supreme Court. However, over time, their rulings and judicial temperaments could influence public perceptions of the Court’s legitimacy and role in democracy. 2. **Shaping Future Legal Landscapes:** The extended influence of these justices could lead to significant shifts in legal precedents, especially in areas like reproductive rights, voting rights, and anti-discrimination law, profoundly impacting American society and reflecting a desire to extend Ginsburg’s legacy into new areas of legal and societal advancement. 3. **Historical Context and Future Propositions:** This reaction to Ginsburg's death and the subsequent reshaping of the Court underscore the enduring impact of individual justices on the nation’s legal fabric. It also highlights how societal and political responses to such moments can drive significant institutional change, prompting discussions on the nature of the judiciary in a democratic society. In this light, the decision to nominate exceptionally young and ideologically motivated justices as a direct response to recent events surrounding the Supreme Court represents a multifaceted strategy aimed at ensuring long-term influence over the Court’s direction, preserving and extending the legacies of progressive icons like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and addressing the profound legal and ethical challenges of the 21st century."},{"prompt":"Kagan also retired the following year, and replaced by a dark horse : Same as previous, but age 29.","completion":"Should Justice Elena Kagan retire the subsequent year following the appointments of two prodigiously young justices, and President Biden nominates yet another exceptionally youthful justice at the age of 29—a dark horse nominee—this would represent an extraordinarily bold and unprecedented reshaping of the U.S. Supreme Court. This scenario implies a calculated attempt to decisively influence the Court's ideological balance and its legal outlook for an exceptional span of time. Let's delve into the potential implications and narratives such a scenario could unfold: # Short-Term Reactions 1. **Political Controversy:** The nomination of a 29-year-old, seemingly out of left field, to the Supreme Court would likely precipitate intense political controversy. Republicans and even some moderate Democrats might question the nominee's experience and readiness for such a pivotal role in the judiciary. The age and relative obscurity of the nominee would dominate discussions, emphasizing the nominee's perceived strengths, weaknesses, and judicial philosophy in unprecedented detail. 2. **Public Interest and Engagement:** The nomination could significantly heighten public interest in the Supreme Court and judicial appointments, particularly among younger Americans, who might see this as a move towards a more progressively representative judiciary. However, it could also raise concerns about the politicization of the Court and the strategic long-term packing of the bench with ideologically similar justices. # Judicial and Legal Implications 1. **Extended Tenure:** Assuming the 29-year-old justice could serve for over 80 years based on the premise that they could live to 130, their influence on the Supreme Court and American jurisprudence would be unparalleled. The potential for such an extended tenure again raises questions about the wisdom of lifetime appointments without any term limits. 2. **Shaping Legal Precedents:** This justice, given their youth and presumably progressive leanings, would have the opportunity to shape pivotal legal precedents across a broad swath of American life, potentially including transformative decisions on technology, climate change, civil rights, and emerging societal issues that challenge current legal frameworks. # Long-Term Considerations 1. **Changing the Judiciary:** The cumulative effect of three historically young justices joining the Supreme Court in quick succession would likely lead to calls for judicial reforms. Discussions might include setting term limits for justices, changing the appointment process, or other measures to ensure the Court's balance and its perceived detachment from direct political influence. 2. **Legacy and Influence:** These appointments could be seen as part of a strategic move to cement a long-lasting legacy of progressive legal influence on the Supreme Court. This strategy would likely be debated in terms of its impact on the Court's role as an independent arbiter in the U.S. legal system. 3. **Adaptation and Responsiveness:** A Supreme Court significantly shaped by these young appointees would be in a unique position to adapt to and address legal challenges posed by rapid technological advancements, environmental changes, and shifts in global power dynamics. Their rulings could fundamentally alter the landscape of American law and rights. # Conclusion The hypothetical scenario in which Justice Kagan retires and is replaced by a 29-year-old dark horse nominee, following two other young justices, underscores a deliberate and historical strategy to shape the future of the Supreme Court for generations. While such a move carries implications for the politicization of the Court, its independence, and the nature of its rulings, it also opens up broad discussions about the future of the U.S. legal system, the role of the judiciary in a democratic society, and how the Court adapts to societal evolution. This scenario, albeit speculative, invites a deep reexamination of the principles underlying the highest judicial authority in the United States."},{"prompt":"actually, it is also partisan liberal in the mold of Brennan and Douglas","completion":"If the nominee replacing Justice Elena Kagan is not only 29 years old, but also a partisan liberal in the mold of Justices William Brennan and William O. Douglas, this highlights an even more pronounced strategy by the administration to solidify a long-term liberal ideological presence on the U.S. Supreme Court. Justices Brennan and Douglas were known for their expansive views on civil liberties and rights, often advocating for a broad interpretation of the Constitution that emphasizes individual rights and liberties. Integrating a nominee with similar judicial philosophies into the Supreme Court would have a range of implications: # Ideological Implications 1. **Liberal Precedents:** A justice with a jurisprudential approach akin to Brennan or Douglas could play a critical part in establishing and upholding liberal precedents, particularly in areas of civil liberties, social justice, environmental law, and potentially emerging domains like digital privacy and rights. 2. **Ideological Balance:** Such appointments would dramatically shift the ideological balance of the Court. With three extremely young liberal justices joining the bench in quick succession, and espousing views similar to iconic liberal justices, the Court's direction on many contentious issues would likely tilt leftward for decades. # Judicial and Societal Impact 1. **Long-term Legal Strategy:** This approach reflects a strategic long-term vision for the Court, aiming not just for short-term legal victories but for shaping a broad swath of American law over time. Decisions on fundamental rights, voting rights, separation of church and state, and more could reflect this vision. 2. **Public Reaction and Engagement:** The clear ideological stance of the nominee could energize the political base of the Democratic Party and younger, more progressive Americans. However, it might also deepen the partisan divide over the judiciary, leading to increased scrutiny and polarized public discourse regarding the Supreme Court's rulings and its role in American democracy. # Challenges and Concerns 1. **Concerns about Judicial Independence:** The explicit ideological leanings of the nominee might raise concerns about the independence of the judiciary. Critics might argue that such a Court is too closely aligned with the political goals of a particular party, potentially undermining the public perception of the Court as an impartial arbiter of the law. 2. **Potential for Judicial Reform:** The significant shift in the Court's ideological makeup, brought about by these young, liberal justices, could prompt serious consideration of judicial reforms. This might include discussions on term limits for justices, mechanisms for ensuring a balanced Court, or changes to the nomination and confirmation process to reduce political polarization. # Historical Context and Legacy Justices Brennan and Douglas have left a lasting legacy on the Supreme Court, significantly influencing civil rights and liberties jurisprudence. A new justice in their mold would be poised to carry forward this legacy, potentially addressing 21st-century challenges with a similar philosophical approach. This could shape not just individual rulings, but the broader trajectory of American constitutional law, reflecting evolving societal values and challenges. In sum, the nomination and confirmation of a justice at such a young age, expressly in the mold of Brennan and Douglas, would represent a pivotal moment in American legal and political history. It would likely set the stage for transformative changes in U.S. law and society, with the Supreme Court playing a central role in navigating these changes."},{"prompt":"The 29 year old justice was born in 1994. He graduated Harvard Law School in 2017, writing spectacular writings about law. He was also known as Frostfury in the eSports community, having played in eSports teams in Leage of Legends between 2010 and 2017, after early retirement to become a circuit judge.","completion":"The appointment of a 29-year-old justice, born in 1994, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 2017 and has a background as \\"Frostfury\\" in the eSports community, playing in League of Legends teams, is a vivid illustration of how the profiles of judicial nominees can evolve to reflect broader societal changes and the diversification of experience considered valuable at the highest levels of the legal profession. # Unique Background and Public Perception 1. **Bridging Generational Gaps:** This justice's background could serve to bridge generational divides, connecting the judiciary more closely with younger generations who are digital natives and for whom eSports and online communities form a significant part of their cultural and social landscape. His appointment could symbolize a modernization of the judiciary, making it more relatable and accessible to a broader audience. 2. **Public Interest and Engagement:** His unique blend of high-level legal achievement and prominence in the eSports world would likely attract considerable public interest, potentially engaging people in the workings of the Supreme Court who might previously have felt disconnected from legal and judicial processes. This engagement can demystify the Court and make its decisions more understandable and relevant to the public. # Implications for Judicial Considerations 1. **Tech-Savvy Perspective:** His eSports background suggests a deep understanding of digital culture, technology, and potentially issues around digital privacy, copyright, and online behavior. This tech-savvy perspective could be invaluable in cases involving digital rights, cybersecurity, intellectual property related to software and digital media, and the regulation of virtual spaces. 2. **Innovative Thinking:** Being steeped in both the competitive world of eSports and the rigors of legal scholarship might bring an innovative and unconventional approach to legal reasoning and problem-solving on the Court. His career trajectory shows a willingness to diverge from traditional paths and could hint at a judicial philosophy open to new interpretations of the law in light of technological and societal shifts. # Potential Challenges 1. **Experience and Depth of Legal Insight:** While his legal writings have been described as spectacular, some might question the depth and breadth of his legal experience given his age and the unconventional path he took to the bench. His relatively swift transition from law school graduate to circuit judge to Supreme Court justice would be scrutinized for the richness of legal insight and practical judicial experience it provided. 2. **Perceptions of Seriousness:** Despite the increasing recognition of eSports as a legitimate and financially significant industry, some segments of the public and the legal community might question the seriousness of a candidate for the Supreme Court with such a background. Overcoming stereotypes and biases associated with gaming culture could be a challenge both for him and for the administration that nominated him. # Conclusion The nomination of a Supreme Court justice with a rich background in both high-level legal scholarship and competitive eSports represents a groundbreaking development that mirrors broader societal changes. His potential contributions to the Court could span from offering fresh perspectives on technology-related legal issues to engaging younger generations with the judiciary. However, his unconventional path to the Supreme Court would also present challenges and raise questions about experience, depth of legal knowledge, and the evolving criteria for selecting justices to the highest court in the United States. This scenario underscores the dynamic nature of societal values and the qualifications deemed important for judicial leadership in an increasingly digital age."},{"prompt":"In 2017, Trump appoints him to the circuit, without significant paper trail, but was expected to be a moderate conservative.","completion":"The scenario where President Donald Trump appoints a young, seemingly moderate conservative individual to a circuit court position in 2017, who later turns out to have a groundbreaking background in both legal scholarship and the eSports community, marks an intriguing development in the judicial landscape. This individual, graduating from Harvard Law School in the same year and quickly rising to a circuit judge position, presents a case of a judicial career fast-tracked in a surprising direction, diverging from initial expectations. Here’s an analysis of how this trajectory could unfold and impact various spheres: # Judicial Appointment and Ideological Shift 1. **Initial Conservative Label:** Initially expected to lean moderate conservative based on the political orientation of the appointing president and lacking a significant paper trail to thoroughly gauge his judicial philosophy, this appointment would have likely been part of President Trump's broader agenda to reshape the federal judiciary with younger, conservatively aligned judges. 2. **Subsequent Ideological Reorientation:** This judge's later nomination to the Supreme Court, revealing a background deeply entrenched in progressive ideologies similar to those of Justices William Brennan and William O. Douglas, alongside a notable history in the eSports arena, would suggest a significant and rather unconventional ideological journey. It highlights the unpredictability and complexity of personal and professional evolution, especially when initial public records provide limited insight into an individual's comprehensive worldview. # Implications for the Judiciary and Public Perception 1. **Redefining Judicial Profiles:** This narrative underscores the evolving profiles of judicial nominees and the increasing recognition of non-traditional backgrounds as potentially enriching the judiciary. The progression from a perceived moderate conservative appointed by a Republican president to a Supreme Court nominee with a distinctly liberal, civil libertarian leaning challenges conventional categorizations and expectations within the judicial nomination process. 2. **Shift in Strategic Appointments:** The trajectory of this individual, from the circuit court to being a potential Supreme Court justice under a Democratic administration, illustrates the unpredictability of long-term strategic court appointments. It reflects the intricate dynamics of political alignments, personal philosophies, and the potential for significant ideological shifts over time. 3. **Engagement and Legitimacy:** The diverse background and unexpected rise of such a figure could stimulate broader public engagement with the judiciary, appealing to younger generations and those interested in technology and digital culture. However, it also raises questions about perceived legitimacy and the balance of professional achievement versus age and traditional experience within the highest levels of the judiciary. # Legal and Societal Consideration 1. **Influence on Future Cases:** With expertise in technology and a fresh perspective on digital rights, privacy, and possibly intellectual property, this justice could significantly influence how the Supreme Court navigates emerging legal landscapes shaped by digital innovation and cybersecurity challenges. 2. **Motivating Judicial Diversity:** This case could motivate a more open-minded approach to evaluating the qualifications and potential contributions of judicial nominees, emphasizing diverse experiences and unconventional career paths as valuable assets to the legal community. # Conclusion The appointment of a young, initially moderate conservative circuit judge by President Trump, who later emerges as a liberal Supreme Court nominee with a rich eSports background, exemplifies the unpredictable nature of judicial careers and ideologies. It challenges traditional narratives about the progression and classification of judicial philosophy, underscores the dynamic relationship between personal evolution and professional trajectories, and reflects the broader societal shifts towards valuing diverse experiences within the judiciary."},{"prompt":"In 2022, he was listed in Biden's SCOTUS potential appointments. Conservatives think appointment of this judge will be a nightmare for the Conservatives.","completion":"The inclusion of this young, formerly moderate conservative judge, now recognized for his liberal leanings and progressive legal thoughts, in President Joe Biden's list of potential Supreme Court appointments in 2022 represents a significant point of contention and strategic play in the political and judicial arena. Given his unique background, rapid rise within the judicial system, and evolving ideological stance, his potential nomination is seen as a particularly contentious issue among conservatives. Here are some insights into how this scenario unfolds and its implications: # Conservative Concerns 1. **Ideological Transformation:** Conservatives might view the judge’s ideological shift as alarming, worrying that his appointment could secure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for decades. Given his young age, eSports background, and legal acumen, they fear he could influence a wide array of future decisions on key issues, including gun rights, religious freedoms, regulatory powers, and social policies, in ways that counter conservative values. 2. **Future Precedent:** This judge symbolizes a departure from more traditional, conservative judicial appointments made during the Trump administration, representing a potential shift in how future justices might approach the interpretation of the Constitution. Conservatives are concerned that his dynamic and modern perspective could reshape legal landscapes in unforeseen ways, setting new precedents that deeply entrench progressive policies. 3. **Longevity and Influence:** Given the judge's potential to serve on the Supreme Court for many decades, conservatives are apprehensive about the long-lasting impact he could have, not just on specific rulings, but on the philosophical direction of the Court as a whole. His influence could extend far beyond immediate legal battles, affecting the trajectory of American law well into the future. # Political and Judicial Strategy 1. **Mobilization of Conservative Base:** The prospect of this judge's nomination could serve as a rallying point for conservatives, galvanizing efforts to oppose his confirmation. This situation would likely become a significant focus for conservative media, advocacy groups, and politicians, potentially influencing upcoming election cycles and mobilizing voters around the judiciary's future. 2. **Calls for Judicial Reform:** This nomination scenario might amplify conservative voices calling for judicial reforms, such as imposing term limits on Supreme Court justices or altering the nomination and confirmation processes to prevent perceived ideological packing of the Court. 3. **Reevaluation of Nomination Strategies:** Both parties might reassess their strategies for judicial nominations, considering not just the immediate impact of appointees but their long-term ideological trajectories and potential for evolution. This scenario underscores the unpredictability of relying solely on a nominee's past record as a predictor of their future judicial philosophy. # Conclusion The consideration of this young judge, initially appointed by Trump and later evolving into a figure with liberal inclinations, for a Supreme Court position under the Biden administration illustrates the complex dynamics of judicial appointments in the contemporary political climate. His potential nomination represents a flashpoint for ideological, cultural, and generational debates within the American legal and political landscape, with conservatives viewing his appointment as a significant threat to their judicial and legislative priorities. This scenario not only highlights the strategic importance of Supreme Court nominations but also emphasizes the broader ideological battles that define American governance today."},{"prompt":"In 2024, Biden appoints him to the Court after Kagan retires. Beforehand, Breyer and Sotomayor were already replaced by young, partisan liberal civil libertarians.","completion":"The hypothetical appointment of this young, previously presumed moderate conservative who has evolved into a liberal justice, to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024 following Justice Elena Kagan's retirement, would come after President Joe Biden had already replaced Justices Breyer and Sotomayor with young, partisan liberal civil libertarians. This sequence of events would significantly shift the composition and ideological bearing of the Supreme Court, marking a transformative period in its history. Let's explore the implications and potential outcomes of this scenario: # Ideological Shift and Court Dynamics 1. **Liberal Majority:** With the addition of three young, liberal justices, the Supreme Court would firmly tilt towards a liberal ideological majority. This shift could have profound implications on landmark decisions concerning issues such as reproductive rights, healthcare, environmental regulations, voting rights, Second Amendment rights, and more. 2. **Legal Precedents:** The new liberal-majority Court could potentially revisit conservative-leaning rulings from the past, setting new legal precedents that align more closely with progressive values and civil libertarian principles. 3. **Public Perception:** Such a significant ideological transformation of the Court might lead to varied reactions from the public. While progressives and Democrats could view this as a victorious outcome ensuring legal protections and advancements in civil liberties, conservatives would likely view the new Court composition as a threat to their judicial and legislative priorities. # Judicial Philosophy and Impact 1. **Civil Liberties Focus:** Given the civil libertarian inclinations of the new justices, we could expect a strong emphasis on expanding and protecting individual rights and freedoms. Cases involving digital privacy, police powers, freedom of speech, and other First Amendment rights could see particularly impactful rulings. 2. **Long-term Influence:** The relatively young age of the new justices means their influence could last for several decades, shaping U.S. law and societal norms well into the latter half of the 21st century. Their rulings could fundamentally alter the landscape on various contemporary issues facing American society. # Political and Societal Reactions 1. **Political Polarization:** The Supreme Court's stark ideological shift could exacerbate political polarization in the country, with debates over the Court's role and its decisions becoming even more heated. Opposition parties might increase calls for Court reform or restructuring in response. 2. **Legislative Strategy:** Knowing the Court's liberal leanings, Republican lawmakers might adjust their legislative strategies, either by seeking bipartisan support for new laws to ensure constitutional muster or by attempting to limit the Court's power through jurisdiction stripping or other means. 3. **Judicial Appointments:** Future presidential administrations and the Senate might reconsider their approach to judicial appointments, weighing the long-term ideological impacts more carefully. This could lead to a broader evaluation of candidates' judicial philosophies, backgrounds, and the potential for ideological evolution over time. # Conclusion The hypothetical scenario of President Joe Biden appointing a young, evolved liberal justice to the Supreme Court in 2024, following the retirement of Justice Kagan and after already having replaced Justices Breyer and Sotomayor with like-minded jurists, represents a landmark shift in the Court's composition. This change would not only impact the immediate legal landscape, but also set the stage for decades of progressive rulings and interpretations of the Constitution. While heralded by some as a necessary evolution towards a more civil libertarian jurisprudence, others could view it as a pivot point necessitating serious discussions about the structure and future of the Supreme Court within American democracy."},{"prompt":"after all, the Conservatives had a 6-3 majority, but the 3 judges are so partisan liberal that they write fiery dissents.","completion":"The transformation of the U.S. Supreme Court’s composition from a conservative 6-3 majority to include three young justices labeled as partisan liberals contributes to a dynamic and potentially polarizing period in the Court’s history. The presence of these outspoken liberal justices, known for their \\"fiery dissents,\\" indicates a Court deeply divided along ideological lines yet vibrant with legal debate and intellectual rigor. Here’s an exploration of the implications and dynamics this scenario engenders: # Amplification of Ideological Debates 1. **Dissent as Influence:** While the conservative majority may dictate the outcomes of many landmark cases, the fiery and well-articulated dissents of the liberal justices serve not just as critique but as future legal blueprints. Dissents often lay the groundwork for legal strategies and principles that could later be adopted by the Court when its composition or societal norms change. 2. **Public Engagement:** The sharp, ideologically driven dissents can play a significant role in shaping public opinion. They translate complex legal issues into narratives that resonate with broader societal concerns, thereby engaging the public in legal discourse and potentially influencing public sentiment and policy. # Shaping Future Legal Frameworks 1. **Legal Scholarship:** The articulate and passionate dissents contribute significantly to legal scholarship, offering rigorous arguments that law students, academics, and practicing lawyers will study, cite, and debate for years to come. They become part of the legal lexicon that defines and refines American jurisprudence. 2. **Blueprint for Change:** History shows that today’s dissents can become tomorrow's majority opinions. As societal norms evolve, the legal arguments laid out in these dissents may gain traction, influencing future justices and potentially reshaping legal precedents in line with the views they espouse. # Impact on the Court’s Legitimacy and Public Perception 1. **Perception of Division:** The presence of strong ideological divides, encapsulated by fiery dissents, might contribute to a public perception of the Court as a highly politicized body. While this could diminish its perceived impartiality, it also reflects the Court's role as a mirror to the society it serves, hashing out the same contentious issues that divide the nation. 2. **Legitimacy Through Debate:** Conversely, the vigorous exchange of opposing ideas, exemplified by these dissents, can reinforce the Court’s legitimacy. It underscores the Court as an arena for serious intellectual and legal debate, where diverse viewpoints are expressed and considered, even if they do not prevail. # The Role of the Liberal Justices 1. **Moral and Ideological Stance:** The young, partisan liberal justices, recognized for their fiery dissents, position themselves not just as adjudicators but as moral and ideological voices within the legal community. They advocate for what they perceive as justice, even in the face of a conservative majority, embodying a steadfast commitment to their interpretation of the Constitution’s principles. 2. **Influence Beyond the Bench:** These justices may also influence legal thought and policy outside the courtroom, through public speeches, writings, and participation in legal forums. Their perspectives contribute to the broader national discourse on justice, rights, and the role of government. # Long-term Perspectives The impact of these three young, liberal justices will unfold over decades. While they may find themselves in the minority initially, the cyclical nature of political and judicial shifts, combined with their potential long tenure, means they could eventually shape the Court’s majority ideology or inspire a new generation of legal thinkers and practitioners. Their fiery dissents are a testament to the enduring nature of democratic debate and the ongoing evolution of American jurisprudence."},{"prompt":"In 2024, the three are all below the age of 38. They are also set to be in the bench to as late as 2070s.","completion":"The scenario describing three Supreme Court justices, all under the age of 38 by 2024 and positioned to serve potentially until the 2070s, sketches an unprecedented and transformative era for the U.S. Supreme Court. This youthful trifecta on the bench symbolizes not only a significant ideological shift but also heralds a long-term evolution in legal philosophy and jurisprudence. Their potential to influence American law and society, given their extended tenure, cannot be overstated. Here are some of the broader implications: # Generational Influence and Legal Evolution 1. **Decades of Influence:** Serving on the Supreme Court for potentially 50 years or more, these justices will preside over numerous landmark cases that will shape American law across generations. Their influence will extend into a future that will likely grapple with issues we can currently barely anticipate, including advanced technological challenges, environmental crises, and evolving concepts of privacy, personal rights, and international law. 2. **Reflecting Societal Shifts:** Given their ages, these justices may bring perspectives that more closely align with younger generations, potentially influencing decisions on issues such as digital rights and freedoms, climate change, LGBTQ+ rights, and systemic inequality with a nuance that reflects contemporary understandings and sensibilities. # Judicial Philosophy and Public Engagement 1. **Innovative Legal Approaches:** Their age and potentially more progressive viewpoints may encourage innovative legal thinking and approaches to constitutional interpretation. This could lead to the embrace of new legal principles or the revival and reapplication of dormant ones in light of modern realities. 2. **Engagement with the Public:** Younger justices might also be more adept and willing to engage with the public in new ways, whether through the use of technology or through their decisions and writings themselves. They could play pivotal roles in demystifying the judiciary and enhancing its transparency and perceived relevance among younger demographics. # Challenges and Responsibilities 1. **Responsibility of Stewardship:** Bearing the weight of long-term stewardship of American law, these justices will need to balance respect for precedent with the adaptability required to address new legal challenges. Their decisions will need to be not only legally sound but also forward-thinking, anticipating the future impact and implications in a rapidly changing world. 2. **Navigating Partisan Divides:** The apparent ideological bent of these justices, alongside their potent dissents against a conservative majority, may exacerbate perceptions of the Court as a partisan entity. Overcoming or addressing this perception will be a considerable challenge, requiring a meticulous and perhaps innovative approach to crafting and communicating their rulings. 3. **Adapting to Societal and Technological Changes:** The issues that will come before the Supreme Court over the next decades will likely involve complex questions about technology, ethics, and societal norms. These justices will need to continuously educate themselves on these fronts, perhaps more so than any previous generation of justices, to remain effective arbiters of the law. # Conclusion The appointment of three young, liberal justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, poised to serve until the 2070s, represents a momentous shift in the Court's makeup. Their long tenure will offer a unique opportunity to mold the arc of American jurisprudence over a significant portion of the 21st century. However, it also places upon them a profound responsibility to uphold the principles of justice, equity, and constitutional integrity in an era of rapid and unpredictable change. As they navigate their historic roles, their decisions, dissents, and philosophies will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the fabric of American law and society."},{"prompt":"function random(min, max, step) {","completion":"// Calculate the range of values based on the min, max, and step input let range = (max - min) / step; // Generate a random number within the range let randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * range) * step + min; return randomValue; }"},{"prompt":"Who are the type of people who shop for used appliances online?","completion":"Shopping for used appliances online appeals to a variety of people due to several reasons related to budget, environmental consciousness, and specific appliance needs. Here's a closer look at the type of people who might be inclined to shop for used appliances online: 1. **Budget-Conscious Shoppers:** These individuals are looking to save money. Used appliances typically cost significantly less than new ones, making them attractive to people on a tight budget or those who prefer to allocate their resources elsewhere. 2. **Environmentally Conscious Consumers:** Buying used is a form of recycling, helping to reduce waste and the demand for new products, which in turn diminishes the environmental impact associated with manufacturing and shipping new appliances. People who prioritize sustainability might choose used appliances to lessen their ecological footprint. 3. **DIY Enthusiasts and Restorers:** Some people enjoy the challenge and creativity involved in restoring or repurposing old appliances. They might look for specific models to refurbish themselves or to use in DIY projects. 4. **Owners of Vintage or Unique Homes:** Individuals who own homes with retro or unique styles might prefer appliances that match the period or aesthetic of their living spaces. New appliances with modern designs might not fit in as well with these types of homes. 5. **Property Managers and Landlords:** When outfitting rental properties, landlords and property managers often seek cost-effective solutions. Used appliances can often meet their needs at a fraction of the cost of purchasing new, especially for short-term rentals or properties where the aesthetics of appliances are less important. 6. **Second-Home Owners:** People who own vacation homes or secondary residences might not want to invest as much in appliances for a house that is not their primary residence. Used appliances can offer a practical and economical solution. 7. **Students and Recent Graduates:** Young adults moving into their first apartment or dorm might have limited funds and could find used appliances to be an affordable way to furnish their living spaces. 8. **Tech and Appliance Enthusiasts:** Some individuals enjoy experimenting with older technology or are fans of certain discontinued models. These enthusiasts might seek out specific used appliances for their unique features or performance that can't be found in newer models.

The challenge was simple yet stomach-churning: The all-you-can-eat buffet championship—a contest not for the faint of heart or the small of stomach. Enter Mr. All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Champion, a man whose stomach was a bottomless pit, whose appetite was as big as Mr. Greedy’s ego, and whose digestive fortitude was matched only by his ambitious belly. His real name was Mr. Albert Canbloat, but after his nine consecutive wins at the Dillydale Buffet-off, the townsfolk knew him only as Mr. Buffet Champion. Mr. Buffet Champion didn't just eat.

Little Miss Sunshine, the contest announcer, was just about to signal the start when Mr. Buffet Champion, with the poise of a diner knighted by the Order of the Eternal Napkin, stood before his table poised for victory. The air horn blared, and it was as if a beast was unleashed. Mr. Buffet Champion tackled the table with the gusto of a superhero with an overactive metabolism. He ate through the buffet like a lawnmower set loose in a field of lettuce. **Chapter 3: The Challengers** It wasn't long before his challengers began to falter. Mr. Rush turned green and bolted for the bathroom. Miss Naughty tried cheating by slipping her extra servings onto Mr. Tickle's plate, but was disqualified when Mr. Tickle, well, tickled her into confessing. Meanwhile, Mr. Nervous just nervously nibbled on a bread roll the whole time, sweat pooling around him like a personal moat of anxiety. But not Mr. Buffet Champion. He powered through, fueled by a mix of determination, an inexplicable metabolic rate, and a passionate love for buffet food. **Chapter 4: The Tipping Point** Just as it seemed like the desserts were about to do him in, Mr. Buffet Champion had a vision. Mr. Messy appeared to him, covered in what looked like the remnants of the chocolate fountain, and said, “Remember, it's not about eating until you can't anymore; it's about eating until you realize you probably should have stopped a while ago.” Inspired, Mr. Buffet Champion dug deep, channeling the spirit of every leftover meal he’d ever consumed. He stood, a crumb-crusted gladiator, and approached the dessert section with a renewed appetite for victory. **Chapter 5: The Sweet Taste of Triumph** With one final, Herculean effort that would have made Mr. Strong weep with pride, Mr. Buffet Champion cleared the last of the desserts, stunning the crowd into a sugar-shocked silence. Suddenly, an eruption of cheers filled the air, louder than the sound of Mr. Noisy eating popcorn. Mr. Buffet Champion had done it again. He was awarded the Golden Spoon, a trophy so prestigious in the competitive eating world, it was rumored Mr. Greedy had once tried to eat it. As the sun set on Dillydale, Mr. Buffet Champion sat, triumphantly exhausted, surrounded by plates that once held what could have fed an entire village for a week. He had proven once again that when it comes to the all-you-can-eat buffet, he was, without a doubt, the undisputed champion. And as he waddled home, he wondered, not for the first time, whether next year, he should maybe just try the salad bar. **The End** And so goes the legend of Mr. All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Champion, a man whose appetite was as large as his heart, and whose story was as filled with joy and jeering as his stomach was with jellies and jams. In Dillydale, legends come and go, but the tale of a champion who ate not just with his mouth, but with his spirit, will live on forever."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr Privacy Breach","completion":"**Title**: Mr. Privacy Breach: The Great Dillydale Data Disaster **Chapter 1: The Invasion of Privacy Begins** In the not-so-quiet town of Dillydale, everyone had a secret. Mr. Quiet had an unspoken love for heavy metal, Little Miss Shy secretly moonlighted as a karaoke queen, and Mr. Bump... well, he didn’t have many secrets, considering his life was an open book of accidents. But then there was Mr. Privacy Breach, a man with an insatiable curiosity and absolutely no concept of personal space or, indeed, the law. With a knack for popping up uninvited and a penchant for peeping at personal data, he was about to take Dillydale by storm—and not in a good way. **Chapter 2: The Uninvited Guest** One day, Mr. Privacy Breach decided he'd had enough of guessing what his neighbors were up to. Armed with a set of binoculars, a stack of self-written “search warrants,” and a dubious understanding of what constitutes public information, he set out to become the self-proclaimed \\"sheriff of sharing.\\" His first stop? Mr. Nosy's house. Upon arriving, he announced, \\"It’s me, Mr. Privacy Breach, here to liberate your data!\\" to which Mr. Nosy replied, \\"But I'm usually the nosy one!\\" Confusion ensued as they both stood there, trying to out-nose each other. **Chapter 3: The Dillydale Data Disaster** Not content with just annoying Mr. Nosy, Mr. Privacy Breach escalated his endeavors. He hacked into Mr. Happy's email to “cheer up” those he deemed not happy enough with unsolicited pep talks. He photobombed Little Miss Sunshine's selfies with ads for sunscreen. He even livestreamed Mr. Lazy's naps, adding play-by-play commentary like a sports announcer at a sloth racing event. The town was in turmoil. Secrets were spilling like tea in a soap opera. Little Miss Scary’s haunted house was revealed to actually be a cozy bed and breakfast. Mr. Tickle’s tickle attacks were preemptively dodged, leaving him tickling the air in baffled bewilderment. And then came the coup de grâce: Mr. Privacy Breach announced he’d be releasing “The Encyclopaedia Dillydalica,” a compendium of everyone’s quirks, secrets, and most embarrassing moments, available for only 19.99! **Chapter 4: Operation P.B. Shut Down** Dillydale knew they had to act. Led by Little Miss Bossy (because of course it was her), a plan was crafted. The entire town would throw a \\"Surprise! We Know All About You Too, Mr. Privacy Breach!\\" party. The bait? A fake award for \\"Dillydale’s Most Inquisitive Citizen.\\" As expected, Mr. Privacy Breach couldn’t resist. But upon arriving, he found something he hadn’t expected: empathy. Instead of ire, he found understanding; instead of punishment, a privacy policy, written by Mr. Clever, that even he could understand. **Chapter 5: A Lesson Learned** In the end, Mr. Privacy Breach learned the importance of boundaries. Little Miss Sunshine helped him see that real friendships aren’t built on secrets exposed, but on trust earned. The “Encyclopaedia Dillydalica” was never published; instead, Mr. Privacy Breach used his considerable energy to start “The Dillydale Gazette,” a newsletter focusing on Dillydale's achievements, consented fun facts, and a daily apology from Mr. Bump. As for Dillydale, they learned too. Passwords were changed, curtains were drawn a bit tighter, and Mr. Nosy and Mr. Privacy Breach started a club for the curiously minded—with regular guest speeches by Mr. Quiet on the virtues of minding one’s own business. **The End** And so, Dillydale returned to its usual state of cheerful chaos, now with a little bit more privacy and a lot more respect for each other’s personal space. Mr. Privacy Breach may have breached more than just privacy, but he also breezed right into the heart of what makes a community: understanding, forgiveness, and a mutual agreement to not air one’s dirty laundry in public—or at least not without permission."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Lost His Own Birthday","completion":"**Title:** Mr. Lost His Own Birthday: A Dillydale Dilemma **Chapter 1: The Forgotten Festivity** In the whimsically wobbly world of Dillydale, birthdays were a big deal—bigger than Mr. Strong's biceps or Little Miss Sunshine's smile. There were balloons, cakes, surprises, and, in the case of Mr. Happy, an unyielding week-long festival of joy. However, in the midst of this celebratory haven lived Mr. Lost His Own Birthday, or Mr. Lost for short. Mr. Lost’s memory was as spotty as Mr. Messy's dining room carpet after spaghetti night. He could remember the words to every song ever sung by Dillydale's most obscure band, \\"The Wobbly Widgets,\\" but ask him when his birthday was, and he’d give you a blank stare, followed by a random guess. \\"Is it Pancake Day?\\" he'd say, hopefully. **Chapter 2: The Unbirthday Party** Enter Mr. Tickle, who found Mr. Lost's predicament absolutely hilarious. \\"How do you lose your own birthday?\\" he'd chuckle, launching into one of his famous tickling fits, which, admittedly, didn't help Mr. Lost remember any better but made everyone else laugh harder. One day, Little Miss Helpful, feeling particularly helpful, decided it was absolutely unacceptable for Mr. Lost to be birthday-less. “We’ll throw him an unbirthday party! He can’t forget that, because it’s on not his birthday!” she declared, missing the comic irony of her mission. The invitation list read like a who's who of Dillydale: Mr. Noisy bringing the band, Mr. Bump in charge of bubble wrap (for everyone's protection, really), and Little Miss Naughty, banned from the cake-baking committee for obvious reasons. **Chapter 3: The Guess-Your-Age Game** The day of the unbirthday party arrived. Decorations hung with the precision of Mr. Fussy's comb-over. The cake stood tall, an engineering feat rivaled only by Mr. Uppity’s mansion. Everything was perfect. Mr. Lost walked into his surprise unbirthday party, initially confused—“Is it Pancake Day already?”—then delighted as he realized what his friends had done. The highlight of the event was the \\"Guess Your Age\\" game, a harmless bit of fun until Mr. Wrong kept insisting Mr. Lost was turning 107, based on his \\"old soul\\" and preference for 20-minute-naps. **Chapter 4: The Accidental Revelation** In the midst of the festivities, something extraordinary happened. While reaching for a slice of cake, Mr. Lost accidentally knocked over a photo album gifted by Little Miss Memories. Amidst the flurry to pick up the scattered photos, a particularly glittery one caught Mr. Lost's eye. It was him, a year younger, blowing out candles on—lo and behold—a birthday cake. The date on the back of the photo? That very day. Mr. Lost had accidentally found his birthday on his unbirthday. The irony was not lost on him—or anyone else, for that matter. Laughter filled the room, echoing off the walls and possibly being heard as far as three towns over. **Chapter 5: Let Them Eat Cake** From that day forward, Mr. Lost’s birthday was never forgotten. In fact, it had become Dillydale’s most anticipated non-holiday holiday, celebrated with even more enthusiasm than Mr. Happy's happiness festivals. Mr. Lost had not only found his birthday; he’d found a yearly reminder of the joy and eccentricity that comes with having forgetful quirks in a town that never missed a chance for celebration, even if it was for something as absurd as an unbirthday birthday party. **The End** And so, Mr. Lost learned the true meaning of friendship—and calendar management. While he might lose his keys, his way, and occasionally his train of thought, one thing Mr. Lost would never again forget was the day he misplaced his own birthday and found a celebration beyond his wildest imagination. Happy (un)birthday, Mr. Lost. Here’s to many more accidental revelations."},{"prompt":"Besides caffeine, what other central nervous system stimulants are allowed to be legally sold in New Zealand?","completion":"In New Zealand, the availability and legality of central nervous system stimulants are strictly regulated under various pieces of legislation, including the Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 and the Medicines Act 1981. The regulatory framework is designed to control the distribution and use of substances that have significant stimulatory effects on the central nervous system, balancing public health interests with the need for access to medications and other substances for legitimate purposes. Besides caffeine, which is widely available and not strictly regulated, a number of other central nervous system stimulants can be legally sold or prescribed, under certain conditions: 1. **Prescription Medications**: - **Amphetamines** (e.g., dexamphetamine), primarily used for treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and certain cases of narcolepsy. - **Methylphenidate** (e.g., Ritalin, Concerta), another medication for ADHD. - **Modafinil** and **armodafinil**, which are used to treat sleep disorders like narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder. These medications are strictly controlled and only available with a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. 2. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications**: - **Pseudoephedrine** and **phenylephrine**, which are found in some cold and allergy medications as decongestants. Their availability is regulated due to their potential misuse in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine, in particular, is more strictly controlled and may require identification for purchase. - Certain **weight loss supplements** and **energy products** may contain legal stimulants, though these are usually less potent than prescription medications. The ingredients and claims of such products are regulated by the Dietary Supplements Regulations 1985, part of the Food Act 2014, and other relevant legislation to ensure they do not pose a risk to public health. 3. **Nicotine**: - While not always classified alongside central nervous system stimulants like amphetamines, nicotine is a legal stimulant widely used in the form of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and other tobacco products. Its sale and use are regulated under the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990 and more recent amendments, including regulations around vaping and e-cigarette products. It's important to note that New Zealand's drug and medication regulatory framework is continually evolving. New substances can be added or reclassified, and the regulation surrounding the sale and use of certain substances can change. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's advisable to consult official New Zealand government sources or a healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"我要写大学生德育论文，包括以下内容。 大学成长回顾、未来职业展望、感恩我的母校、感怀宿舍班级生活、青春理解人生追求等；","completion":"以下是一篇结合了你提到的元素的大学生德育论文草稿，你可以根据自己的实际经历和感受加以修改和完善： --- # **大学成长：一段自我探索与实现的旅程** 在大学这个多元化的小社会中，我经历了从迷茫到清晰，从探索到实现自我的过程。大学生活不仅仅是学术知识的积累，更是一段人生观、价值观形成的关键时期。每一次的讨论、每一个项目的合作、每一次的社团活动，都在无形中塑造了我对世界的认知，让我学会了批判性思考，学会了如何和不同背景的人合作共事。更重要的是，我在这个过程中发现了自己的兴趣所在，并为未来的职业路径奠定了基础。 # **未来职业展望：一个梦想起航的地方** 面向未来，我希望能将在大学学到的知识和技能应用到实际工作中，特别是我对[X领域]的浓厚兴趣，我希望能在这个领域深耕，为社会的发展贡献自己的一份力量。我清楚地认识到，职业生涯的道路不会一帆风顺，但大学生活教会了我如何面对挑战、如何解决问题。我将带着这份坚持和勇气，去追求我的职业梦想。 # **感恩我的母校：灵魂深处的牵绊** 母校给予了我无限的知识宝库和实践机会，使我在认知上和能力上都得到了极大的提升。更重要的是，母校提供的多元化文化环境让我学会了宽容和尊重，这些软实力将成为我一生中宝贵的财富。我感谢母校给予的每一次机会和挑战，正是这些经历，塑造了现在的我，让我更加自信地走向社会，面对未来。 # **感怀宿舍班级生活：青春的烙印** 宿舍和班级生活是我大学生活中最宝贵的记忆。在那里，我结识了一生的朋友，我们共同经历了学习的压力、生活的烦恼，也分享了成长的喜悦和成功的欢笑。这段时光让我学会了怎样与人相处，怎样在团体中寻找自己的定位，这些经验是任何书本上都学不到的。我将永远珍惜这段时光，感激那些与我一同成长的伙伴们。 # **青春理解人生追求：不懈的探索** 大学生活是我人生旅程中重要的一部分，它不仅仅是知识学习的过程，更是我的青春岁月，是我对人生理想和价值追求不断探索的过程。在这里，我学会了独立思考，学会了批判与自我批判，更重要的是，我开始理解生活的真谛和个人追求的意义。我明白了，无论将来的路怎么走，重要的是保持一颗探索的心和不懈的努力，去追寻内心真正的热爱与追求。 --- 大学生德育论文是对大学生活的回顾和总结，也是对个人成长经历和价值观的反思。希望这篇草稿能为你提供一些灵感和帮助，你可以根据自身经历进一步完善和丰富内容。祝你写作顺利！"},{"prompt":"我要写大学生德育论文，包括以下内容。 大学成长回顾、未来职业展望、感恩我的母校、感怀宿舍班级生活、青春理解人生追求等；要求2000字","completion":"**大学生德育论文** **引言** 大学生活，是人生中一段宝贵的时光。在这几年里，我们不仅获取了知识，更重要的是通过与人交往、参与社会实践等各种活动，对人生有了更深刻的理解和体验。本文以个人经历为核心，回顾大学成长过程，展望未来职业生涯，感恩母校的培育，记忆宿舍与班级生活的点点滴滴，并分享我对青春与人生追求的理解。 **大学成长回顾** 大学生活开启了我认知世界的全新篇章。不同于高中的单一学科学习，大学教育使我接触到了广泛的知识领域，从而拓宽了我的视野。我学会了如何自主学习，例如，为了完成一项课程设计，我不得不熬夜查阅资料、实验。这些经历教会了我责任感和解决问题的能力，并逐步塑造了我独立思考的习惯。 **未来职业展望** 展望未来，我希望能将所学知识应用于社会实践中，为社会的发展做出贡献。对我而言，未来的职业不仅仅是谋生的方式，更是实现自我价值和社会价值的平台。我期待在未来的工作中，能够不断挑战自我，探索更多的可能性，并以此作为自己人生追求的一部分。 **感恩我的母校** 母校给予了我知识和智慧，更重要的是，教育了我如何做人。在大学生活中，我学习了如何合作与共处，如何在竞争与合作中找到平衡，如何在失败中吸取教训，这些宝贵的经历都将伴随我一生。感谢母校，不仅因为她提供了丰富的学习资源，更因为她让我认识了自我，启发了我对人生的探索。 **感怀宿舍班级生活** 宿舍和班级是大学生活中最温馨的部分。在宿舍生活中，我们共同学习，分享彼此的喜怒哀乐；在班级集体中，我们一起组织活动，共同完成团队任务。这些经历让我深刻感受到团队合作的力量，也让我学会了理解和包容，这些都是我今后社会生活中不可或缺的宝贵财富。 **青春理解人生追求** 青春是一段充满活力和挑战的时期。在这段时间里，我对人生有了更深的理解。我意识到，人生不仅仅是追求物质上的满足，更重要的是精神上的丰富和自我实现。因此，我的人生追求不仅是成为一个专业领域内的专家，更重要的是成为一个有责任心、有爱心、对社会有贡献的人。 **结语** 大学生活是一段难忘的旅程，它教会了我知识、提供了成长的机会，更重要的是，它启迪了我对生命的认知和人生价值的追求。未来的路还很长，但我相信，凭借在大学期间积累的经验和智慧，我能够勇敢地走自己的路，实现自己的人生理想。在此，我衷心感谢我的母校、教师、同学们，是你们让我的大学生活充满了意义和乐趣。让我们带着青春的梦想，一起迈向更加美好的明天。"},{"prompt":"Была какая-то старая игра на подобии Civilization в году этак 2000-2010, тоже про развитие цивилизации от каменного века до современности.

Серия Civilization **Схожесть**: В основе лежит концепция пошаговой стратегии, где игрок ведет цивилизацию с древности до ближайшего будущего, соревнуясь с другими цивилизациями. Элементы стратегии включают в себя ведение войн, культурное развитие, дипломатию, исследование технологий и строительство чудес света. **Различие**: Серия Civilization является показателем классической пошаговой стратегии с очень глубоким развитием механик и историческим контекстом. # 2. Серия Call to Power **Схожесть**: Эти игры также являются пошаговыми стратегиями с центральной идеей развития цивилизаций на протяжении различных эпох. В них присутствуют война, культурное развитие, дипломатия. **Различие**: Серия Call to Power пыталась внести некоторые инновации в жанр, например, возможность управления подводными и космическими территориями, а также углубленные аспекты управления государством. Однако, в целом, это направление развивалось параллельно Civilization и не получило такого же колоссального распространения. # 3. Игра Humankind **Схожесть**: Humankind – это пошаговая стратегия, центрирующаяся вокруг создания и развития цивилизации, очень похоже на Civilization. Главное отличие в упоре на культурное развитие и смешивание культур, что придает игре уникальные механики. **Различие**: В Humankind уделено большое внимание культурному влиянию и вариативности развития через выбор культур на разных этапах развития цивилизации. # 4. Игра Millennia **Предположение**: Так как конкретных игр с названием \\"Millennia\\", которые были бы широко известны и попадали бы точно в данный контекст, не много, может возникнуть путаница относительно того, о какой именно игре идет речь. Если же предположить, что речь идет о классических или менее известных стратегиях, то можно сказать, что многие из них делят общую идею управления цивилизацией или градостроительным аспектом. # 5. Игра Ara: History Untold Поскольку информации об игре \\"Ara: History Untold\\" на момент знаний до 2023 года в общедоступных источниках может не быть или она может быть новинкой, сложно дать точное сравнение. Однако, исходя из названия, можно предположить, что она также будет содержать элементы, связанные с историей или управлением цивилизацией. # Общие черты Все перечисленные игры объединяет принадлежность к жанру стратегий, в которых игроку предлагается взять под свой контроль развитие цивилизации или общества, управляя различными аспектами его жизни во времени. Особенностью таких игр является гибкость в выборе путей развития, внимание к деталям исторического процесса и взаимодействия с другими игроками или искусственным интеллектом. # Ключевые различия Основное отличие между играми заключается в наличии уникальных механик и акцентах на определенных аспектах управления или развития.

サブスクリプションモデルでは、顧客が月額や年額でサービスを利用しますが、顧客がいつ解約するか予測することが難しく、収益の安定性や未来の収益予測が困難になりがちです。買い切りの場合は、製品が売れた時点で収益が発生するため、売上の予測がしやすい側面があります。 2. **顧客維持の労力**: サブスクリプションサービスでは、顧客を継続してサービスに留めておくために、定期的な価値提供や顧客サポートの向上が必要です。これに対して、買い切り製品では、一度製品を購入してもらえば、同じ顧客に対して再販売の努力が必要な場合が少ないです。 3. **価格設定の難しさ**: サブスクリプションの価格設定は非常に重要でありながら、難しい側面があります。価格が高すぎると顧客が契約を躊躇し、低すぎると利益が出にくくなります。これは、買い切り製品でも同様ですが、サブスクリプションサービスの場合、市場の変化や競合他社の動向に更に敏感である必要があります。 4. **キャッシュフローの問題**: サブスクリプションモデルの初期段階では、顧客基盤を築くための費用がかかり、その期間中はキャッシュフローが悪化しやすくなります。一方、買い切りモデルでは、商品を販売した時点で利益が確定し、キャッシュフローの管理が比較的容易です。 5. **サービスの質と更新**: サブスクリプションサービスを提供する側は、常にサービスの質を維持し、新鮮さを保つためにアップデートや新機能の追加が必要です。これは、買い切り製品の場合よりも絶えず資源を投入する必要があるため、大きな負担となり得ます。 6. **解約率(チャーン率)の管理**: サブスクリプションビジネスでは、顧客がいつサービスから離れるか（チャーン）を低く抑えることが成功への鍵です。チャーン率の管理とその改善は、ビジネスの存続に直接的な影響を与えます。買い切り商品の場合、一度の購入で終わりとなることも多く、顧客の継続的な維持に関する問題が少ないです。 これらの問題点に対処するために、サブスクリプションサービスを提供する企業は、顧客のニーズを深く理解し、顧客経験を向上させる工夫や、ビジネスモデルの柔軟性を持たせることが重要です。"},{"prompt":"英語の学習をしているのですが動詞の後に目的語をとる形の判別において\\"to 原型\\"の形か\\"~ing\\"の形のどちらを用いるべきかわかりません。 覚えるしかないのでしょうか？それとも何か有効な考え方はありますか？","completion":"英語の動詞の後に続く形（\\"to 原型\\" または \\"~ing\\" 形）の選択は、確かに初学者にとっては難しい問題の一つです。これらの形を選ぶ際には、主に次のような規則や指針がありますが、多くの場合、特定の動詞とその構文を覚える必要があります。 1. **規則に基づく選択**: 一部の動詞や表現は固有のパターンに従います。例えば、\\"enjoy\\", \\"avoid\\", \\"consider\\" などの動詞は通常 \\"~ing\\" 形を取ります（例: I enjoy reading.）。一方で、\\"decide\\", \\"plan\\", \\"want\\" などの動詞は \\"to 原型\\" を取ります（例: I plan to go.）。 2. **意味の違いによる選択**: 一部の動詞は、\\"to 原型\\" と \\"~ing\\" 形の両方を取ることができますが、意味が異なります。例えば、\\"stop to do\\"（～するために止まる）と \\"stop doing\\"（～するのを止める）のように、使い分けが必要です。 3. **固定表現**: 一部の表現は、単に慣用的に \\"to 原型\\" または \\"~ing\\" 形を取るものもあります。これらは、特定のフレーズやイディオムとして覚える必要があります。例えば、\\"look forward to\\" の後は常に \\"~ing\\" 形が来ます（例: I look forward to meeting you.）。 有効な考え方やアプローチは以下のとおりです： - **リスト作成と練習**: 最も一般的な動詞のリストを作成し、それぞれが \\"to 原型\\" と \\"~ing\\" 形のどちらを取るかを覚える。その後、例文を作って実際に使ってみる。 - **文脈の理解**: 動詞が表すアクションの文脈や意味を理解することで、どちらの形を使うべきかの理解が深まります。 - **読み物を通じた学習**: 英語の本、記事、ブログなどを多読し、動詞とその後に続く形の自然な使われ方を観察する。文脈で見ることで、記憶にも残りやすいです。 - **ネイティブとの会話**: 英会話のプラクティスでネイティブスピーカーと話す機会を持つことで、自然な使用例を耳にし、実践的な理解を深めることができます。 結局のところ、多くを覚えることになりますが、これらのアプローチを通じて、より自然で直感的に正しい形を選べるようになるでしょう。また、文法書やオンラインリソースを活用してルールを学ぶことも有効です。"},{"prompt":"Haz una cancion rap sobre el melocoton con esta estructura con una duracion de 2 minutos

Mr. Panic Attack was a peculiar fellow with a wide-eyed stare that could spot a needle in a haystack or a typo in a WhatsApp message from forty yards away. One fateful morning, as Mr. Panic Attack was having his daily breakfast of plain toast and decaffeinated tea (lest his heartbeat decided to run a marathon), he discovered something horrifying—a library book, lurking beneath his sofa, glaring at him with its due date stamped in bold, a date not just past but ancient history! Now, most would simply return the overdue book, perhaps with an apologetic smile. But Mr. Panic Attack? Oh no, he couldn’t just do that. His imagination, akin to a Hollywood director with an unlimited budget, conjured up scenarios where returning the book would lead to imprisonment, or worse, a permanent ban from the library! Fuelled by his wild, catastrophic fantasies, Mr. Panic Attack embarked on a quest to return the book without being noticed. He donned a hilariously oversized trench coat, a pair of Groucho Marx glasses, and set out, looking like a cartoon detective with an identity crisis. First, he attempted the Drop-and-Dash technique at the library. Unfortunately, his approach was more of a Stumble-and-Yelp, drawing the attention of everyone, including Mrs. Shush, the librarian with a stare so sharp it could open canned goods. Fleeing the scene, Mr. Panic Attack devised a new plan involving a complex system of pulleys and levers, intending to deliver the book through the library’s window. The contraption, however, had the structural integrity of a chocolate teapot and spectacularly failed, sending the book (and a slightly embarrassed pigeon) crashing through Mr. Panic Attack's own window instead. Just as Mr. Panic Attack was considering moving to a new country and assuming a new identity (Mr. Serene Expat, perhaps?), Mrs. Shush found him. Bracing for the worst, Mr. Panic Attack awaited his sentence. Mrs. Shush, however, merely handed him a library card. “You do know we abolished overdue fines years ago, right? And even if we hadn’t, we prefer a good laugh over punishment any day!” With a sheepish grin, Mr. Panic Attack learned two valuable lessons that day: first, to check his mail more often for library updates, and second, that sometimes, confronting your panic head-on can lead to unexpectedly delightful outcomes. And from that day on, Mr. Panic Attack was a little less panicked, although he still checks under his sofa daily, just in case another adventure awaits. **THE END** *Disclaimer: No librarians or pigeons were harmed in the making of Mr. Panic Attack’s hilariously misguided adventures.*"},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ MR MEN book transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Mr. Living Megaphone","completion":"**Title: Mr. Living Megaphone and the Quest for Volume Control** In the not-so-quiet town of Eardrumsville, where the leaves rustled at a polite volume and the birds sang in soothing tones, lived Mr. Living Megaphone. Now, Mr. Living Megaphone was not like other folks. He was a walking, talking, living embodiment of loudness. His voice could rattle windows, startle sleeping cats into performing unintentional backflips, and cause spontaneous coffee spills. One fine, earplug-free day, Mr. Living Megaphone decided he wanted to make friends. However, his attempts were a bit... well, let's just say, booming. He’d say “HELLO!” and gardens would wilfully neglect to grow out of sheer fright. He tried whispering, which to others sounded like a shout at a rock concert. Realizing his vocal cords were more heavy metal than a light jazz brunch, Mr. Living Megaphone set out on a dazzlingly loud adventure to find a solution to his overpowering dialogue dilemma. His first stop was the local inventor, Mr. Gizmo, who was so startled by Mr. Living Megaphone's greeting that he invented a device on the spot called “The Scare-a-wayer” - purely by accident. Despite the unfortunate start, Mr. Gizmo presented Mr. Living Megaphone with “The Muffler 3000,” a high-tech collar supposedly designed to soften his sonorous speech. However, the device had the adverse effect, turning his words into incomprehensible, yet still deafening, gibberish. It was back to the drawing board, after apologizing to the entire neighborhood and several confused bats. Next, Mr. Living Megaphone tried the holistic approach by attending a yoga class aimed at finding one's \\"inner quiet.\\" Upon arrival, he enthusiastically bellowed, “NAMASTE!” causing the instructor to levitate in shock and assume the \\"Falling Tree\\" pose involuntarily. After being gently escorted out, with apologies and a complimentary plant for his troubles, Mr. Living Megaphone felt more determined than ever. Then, in a stroke of accidental genius, Mr. Living Megaphone stumbled upon a karaoke night. The audience, initially taken aback by the force of his rendition of \\"Whisper Quietly to Me,\\" soon found themselves enveloped in the sheer power of his performance. It was then that Mr. Living Megaphone discovered his true calling—not to diminish his voice, but to embrace it in its full, thunderous glory. Mr. Living Megaphone went on to become a global sensation, touring the world with earplug sponsors, singing tales of his adventures, and even starting a whispery ASMR side-gig that, surprisingly, only he found ironic. He realized that sometimes, what makes us different doesn't need fixing; it just needs the right stage. **THE END** *Disclaimer: No eardrums were permanently damaged in the making of Mr. Living Megaphone's melodious journey.*"},{"prompt":"帮我写个小论文，要求要两千字。要求如下.德育论文主要内容： 大学成长回顾、未来职业展望、感恩我的母校、感怀宿舍班级生活、青春理解人生追求等","completion":"# 大学时光：从青春的成长到职业的展望 引言 大学是人生中一段极为宝贵的时光，它不仅仅是知识的汲取之地，更是性格、思想成熟的重要阶段。在这个阶段，我们通过学习、生活和社交活动培养了独立、批判性思维，并畅想未来职业道路。回望四年的大学生涯，从刚入学的青涩到即将步入社会的成熟，每一刻都充满了成长和变化。本文将分享我的大学成长回顾、未来职业展望，以及对母校和宿舍班级生活的感恩之情。 大学成长回顾 我的大学生涯是一段自我探索和自我实现的旅程。最初，我对所学专业知之甚少，但在老师和同学的帮助下，我不仅掌握了专业知识，还学会了如何学习。课堂之外，我加入了学校的志愿服务团队和学生社团，这些经历不仅丰富了我的校园生活，更重要的是教会了我团队合作和社交技能。 在学习和生活的过程中，我也面临过挑战和困难。比如，在准备期末考试时，我需要同时应对多门课程的复习，压力山大。但是，正是这些挑战使我学会了时间管理和自我调节的重要性，培养了我解决问题的能力。 未来职业展望 随着毕业的日子一天天临近，我的未来职业规划也越发清晰。我希望能够进入教育行业，成为一名教育者，传授知识，启迪心灵。我深信教育能改变一个人，甚至改变社会。因此，我计划继续深造，攻读研究生学位，为实现我的职业梦想打下坚实的基础。 感恩我的母校 当我回望过去的四年，我深深地感激我的母校给予了我这一切。在这里，我不仅学到了专业知识，更重要的是学会了如何成为一个有责任感、有担当的公民。我的老师不仅是知识的传递者，更像是人生的引路人，他们的言传身教将伴随我一生。 感怀宿舍班级生活 宿舍和班级是我的大学生活中不可分割的部分。我们一起学习、玩耍，共同度过了无数个日日夜夜。这段时间，我们互帮互助，共同成长。宿舍生活教会了我如何与不同背景的人相处，而班级活动则让我体验到了集体的力量。我将永远珍惜在宿舍和班级中度过的美好时光。 青春理解人生追求 大学时光是青春的缩影，我在这里不仅学到了知识，更是学会了如何生活和如何面对自己的内心。在这个阶段，我对人生有了更深的理解和思考。我认识到，真正的生活不仅仅是追求个人的成功和满足，更在于贡献社会、帮助他人。我的人生追求，是成为一个对社会有用的人。 结论 大学生活是我的人生旅程中不可多得的宝贵经历，这段时光塑造了我，让我成长为今天的自己。在未来的日子里，我将带着对母校的感恩之情和对职业的憧憬，勇敢地迈向新的人生阶段，继续追寻属于自己的理想和远方。让我们不忘初心，砥砺前行，为实现个人价值和社会进步共同努力。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unlike his alarmingly punctual neighbors, Mr. Five More Minutes had a rare condition: no matter the situation, he always needed... just five more minutes. One morning, which actually turned out to be afternoon because, let's be honest, mornings were more of a concept to Mr. Five More Minutes, he rolled out of bed with the grace of a disgruntled pancake. \\"Just five more minutes,\\" he grumbled, slapping his snooze button – a device so worn it resembled an ancient, squishy artifact. You see, Mr. Five More Minutes' snooze button wasn't just any old snooze button. It was the most overused, under-appreciated member of the household, worn down from years of abuse but always bouncing back for more. --- **Chapter 2: The Golden Opportunity** One day, as Mr. Five More Minutes was performing his morning ritual of bargaining with his alarm clock for just a smidge more slumber, an ad popped up on his phone. It was spam, but the captivating kind: \\"Discover the Legendary Golden Snooze Button and Never Wake Up Early Again!\\" Intrigued and half-awake, Mr. Five More Minutes made a decision that would change his life forever. He would embark on a quest to find this mythical Golden Snooze Button. Because, in his groggy mind, this wasn't just a quest for a shiny new gadget – it was a quest for unlimited five more minutes. --- **Chapter 3: The Adventure Begins... Eventually** After packing a bag with essential items (a pillow, three different types of sleeping masks, and a flask filled with cold brew coffee – for emergencies), Mr. Five More Minutes set out on his journey. His first stop was the Forest of Nod, a place so tranquil that even the mosquitoes would put you to sleep before biting. Here, he encountered Mr. Early Bird, a ridiculously punctual creature who was already halfway through his day's to-do list. \\"Mr. Five More Minutes, you're late,\\" chirped Mr. Early Bird in a tone that was way too chipper. \\"Just five more minutes,\\" replied Mr. Five More Minutes, which was his way of saying hello, goodbye, and sometimes, thank you. --- **Chapter 4: Trials and Tribulations** As Mr. Five More Minutes ventured deeper into the world of early risers and timekeepers, he faced challenges no man of perpetual tardiness had ever faced. There was the Great Alarm Clock Tower, where the bells rang so loudly they could wake the dead – or, at the very least, a very stubborn Mr. Five More Minutes. Here, he had to stealthily navigate past a legion of Cuckoo Clock Birds without hitting the snooze button on any of them. Then came the River of Roosters, where the roosters didn't just crow at dawn; they hosted all-day crow-a-thons. Mr. Five More Minutes had to charter a boat manned by Captain Nap, a notorious pirate known for taking \\"five more minutes\\" to mean a two-hour detour. --- **Chapter 5: The Quest Concludes (Or Does It?)** Finally, after what felt like an eternity (but was actually closer to three and a half days, give or take a dozen naps), Mr. Five More Minutes stumbled upon the Cave of Continuous Slumber, the rumored resting place of the Golden Snooze Button. Guarding the cave was the fierce dragon of Deadlines, a beast known for breathing fire and calendar invites. Mr. Five More Minutes, in a stroke of genius or perhaps sheer luck, challenged the dragon to a nap-off. The dragon, having never encountered such a brazen opponent, agreed. Hours passed, and the dragon grew impatient, eventually conceding defeat and napping off into the sunset. Mr. Five More Minutes, victorious but mostly asleep, claimed the Golden Snooze Button. --- **Epilogue: A New Dawn** With the Golden Snooze Button in hand, Mr. Five More Minutes returned home, hailed as a hero (though he missed his own welcome party because, you guessed it, he was late). Now, with the power to snooze indefinitely without ever actually oversleeping, Mr. Five More Minutes became a legend in his own right. He hosted workshops on \\"Advanced Snoozing Techniques\\" and \\"The Art of the Perfectly Timed Nap.\\" But if you ask him, he's just a guy who really, really loves his sleep. And maybe, just maybe, he'll find something worth waking up early for. But until then... just five more minutes. **THE END**"},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\"","completion":"\\"photoshoot with a wall of sparse flowers background of beautiful woman, dressed nicely, sheer blouse with voluminous sleeves, nice jewelry, beautiful big nude lips, makeup, long balayage wavy hair, with captivating eyes and a passionate expression, holding a big bouquet of flowers to her chest, ultra-realistic\\""},{"prompt":"В чём разница и схожесть следующих игр: 1) серия Civilization Sid Meier’s Civilization VI (сокр.

UV light is often used to disinfect surfaces, air, water, and medical equipment. 4. Filtration: Filtration can be used as a method of disinfection to remove or reduce the number of microorganisms in liquids or air. Filtration works by passing the contaminated liquid or air through a filter that physically traps and removes microorganisms. 5. Irradiation: Irradiation, such as gamma radiation or electron beam radiation, can be used to disinfect certain materials by damaging the DNA of microorganisms and preventing their growth. It is important to select the appropriate method of disinfection based on the type of microorganisms to be targeted, the type of surface or object to be disinfected, and the specific requirements of the environment. Proper disinfection practices are crucial in preventing the transmission of infectious diseases and maintaining a safe and healthy environment."},{"prompt":"Sterilization: definition, methods of sterilization (physical, chemical, mechanical), quality control.","completion":"Sterilization is the process of completely eliminating all forms of microbial life, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores, from surfaces, equipment, instruments, liquids, or other materials. Sterilization is a crucial practice in healthcare settings, laboratories, pharmaceutical production, and other industries where the presence of microorganisms can lead to infections or contamination. Methods of sterilization can be categorized into physical, chemical, and mechanical methods: 1. Physical sterilization methods: - Autoclaving: Autoclaving uses steam under pressure to achieve high temperatures (usually around 121°C) to kill microorganisms. It is one of the most common and effective methods of sterilization for heat-resistant materials. - Dry heat sterilization: Dry heat sterilization uses high temperatures (usually around 160-180°C) for an extended period to kill microorganisms. It is suitable for heat-stable materials that may be damaged by moisture. - Filtration: Filtration can be used to sterilize liquids by passing them through filters that physically trap and remove microorganisms. - Radiation sterilization: Radiation, such as gamma radiation or electron beam radiation, can be used to sterilize certain materials by damaging the DNA of microorganisms. 2. Chemical sterilization methods: - Ethylene oxide (ETO) sterilization: Ethylene oxide gas is used to sterilize heat-sensitive materials that cannot withstand high temperatures. - Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization: This method uses hydrogen peroxide gas plasma to sterilize heat-sensitive materials. - Peracetic acid sterilization: Peracetic acid is a chemical sterilant that can be used for certain materials and equipment. 3. Mechanical sterilization methods: - Incineration: Incineration involves burning materials at high temperatures to achieve sterilization. - Boiling: Boiling is a simple method of sterilization where materials are immersed in boiling water for a certain period. Quality control is essential in sterilization processes to ensure that the desired level of sterility is achieved. Methods of quality control include biological indicators (e.g., spore tests), chemical indicators (e.g., indicators that change color when exposed to sterilization processes), and process monitoring (e.g., checking parameters such as temperature, pressure, and exposure time). Regular monitoring and validation of sterilization processes are crucial to ensure the efficacy and safety of sterilization procedures."},{"prompt":"Quiero que me digas que debería continuar a la tabla siguiente: +——————————————————————————————————————+ | TABLA DE PERSONAJE | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Nueva Vida | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Nombre Terricola | Gonzalo Portela | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Nombre Saiyajin | Vyomi | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Raza | Saiyajin | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Edades | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Vida anterior | Física: 26 | — Biológica: 52 | — Edad Atemporal: 7300 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Vida actual | Física: 26 | — Biológica: 52 | — Edad Atemporal: 0 | +——————————————————————————————————————+","completion":"| Estadísticas Básicas | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Fuerza | 85 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Velocidad | 90 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Resistencia | 80 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Energía (Ki) | 95 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Inteligencia | 77 | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Habilidades Especiales | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Nombre | Descripción | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Onda de Energía | Capacidad de lanzar una potente descarga de energía desde las manos. | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Teletransportación | Capacidad de moverse instantáneamente a cualquier lugar conocido. | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Transformación Saiyajin | Habilidad para aumentar significativamente la fuerza y las habilidades mediante la transformación en distintos niveles de Super Saiyajin. | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Regeneración Acelerada | Capacidad de recuperar la salud y curar heridas a una velocidad superior a la humana normal. | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Equipamiento | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Nombre | Descripción | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Traje de Combate Saiyajin | Traje altamente resistente y flexible, optimizado para combate y adaptación a diversas condiciones ambientales. | +——————————————————————————————————————+ | Rastreador Saiyajin | Dispositivo de rastreo que permite detectar la ubicación y nivel de energía (Ki) de otros seres vivos. | +——————————————————————————————————————+"},{"prompt":"من فضلك ترجم الاتي الي الانجليزية: فحص محول قديم غير شامل اى قطع غيار","completion":"Inspection of an old adapter Does not include any spare parts."},{"prompt":"Please translate to arabic: Please find the attached quotation, waiting for your response so we can buy the material & go to the site before Eid ISA.","completion":"من فضلك اجد العرض المرفق، في انتظار ردك حتى نتمكن من شراء المواد والذهاب إلى الموقع قبل عيد الفطر بإذن الله."},{"prompt":"ترجم الي الانجليزية: من فضلك اجد العرض المرفق، في انتظار ردك حتى نتمكن من شراء المواد والذهاب إلى الموقع قبل عيد الفطر بإذن الله.","completion":"Please find the attached quotation, waiting for your response so we can purchase the materials and go to the site before Eid, God willing."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

With a perpetual twinkle in his eye and a mustache that seemed to wiggle with glee, he was on a noble quest. Yes, a quest not for gold, not for glory, but for the Holy Grail of groans. Mr. Dad Jokes wore his title like a badge of honor, embossed on a sash that was as loud as his laughter. His house looked exactly like a giant whoopee cushion, and every morning, he'd launch himself out of the bed using a catapult, for he believed every day should start with a \\"spring\\" in your step. One fine morning, after catapulting himself into the bathroom and brushing his teeth with humor-fresh toothpaste (guaranteed to brighten your smile and your day!), Mr. Dad Jokes announced, \\"It's time to find the Ultimate Groan. A joke so potent, it will cause a seismic wave of eye-rolling across Laughalot Land!\\" So, he set off, leaving a trail of chuckles and the inevitable groans in his wake. His first stop was the home of Mr. Grumpy, the one citizen of Laughalot Land who seemed immune to the charms of a well-placed pun. Knocking on the door, he was greeted with a scowl. \\"What do you call an alligator in a vest?\\" Mr. Dad Jokes asked, barely containing his glee. \\"I don't have time for this—\\" Mr. Grumpy started. \\"An in-vest-igator!\\" Mr. Dad Jokes interrupted, bursting into laughter. Mr. Grumpy's frown deepened, but there it was - a reluctant twitch of his lips. One point for Mr. Dad Jokes. Encouraged, Mr. Dad Jokes ventured forth, leaving no stone unturned, no pun unspoken. He traveled from Miss Sunshine's bakery (where he declared the donuts were \\"a-dough-rable!\\") to Mr. Tickle's feather factory (asking if they stocked \\"ticklish-quality feathers\\"). But the Ultimate Groan remained elusive. The laughs were plenty, and the eye-rolls abundant, yet he yearned for that mythical reaction that would cement his legacy. It was in the midst of this pilgrimage, at the Grand Laughalot Library, where Mr. Dad Jokes had his eureka moment. Surrounded by ancient joke books and comedy manuscripts, it dawned on him: to achieve the Ultimate Groan, he must craft a joke so grand, so universally understandable, that it transcended generational gaps. He cleared his throat, gathering a crowd. Mr. Nervous, Miss Magic, even Little Miss Sunshine was there, anticipating what could possibly come next. \\"Why did the scarecrow win an award?\\" Mr. Dad Jokes boomed, his mustache quivering in excitement. The crowd was silent, on tenterhooks. \\"Because he was outstanding in his field!\\" The reaction was instantaneous. A tsunami of groans rolled over Laughalot Land, accompanied by a rhythmic slap of palms meeting faces. In the distance, a dog howled. A baby laughed for the first time. A tree fell in the forest, and yes, it made a sound. Mr. Dad Jokes had done it. He found the Ultimate Groan. His quest complete, Mr. Dad Jokes didn't rest on his laurels. No, for a true comedian's journey is never over. There were always more puns to ponder, more jokes to juggle. But that night, as Laughalot Land settled under a blanket of stars and the soft chuckles of its inhabitants, Mr. Dad Jokes knew he had achieved something special. Somewhere out there, the Ultimate Groan echoed, a testament to the power of a good, bad joke. And in his giant whoopee cushion house, Mr. Dad Jokes fell asleep with a smile, dreaming of puns yet to come.

Do not use custom libraries. For all internet requests use curl library, do not use file_get_contents in the code. Each command should have its own class that inherits the \\"CommandInterface\\". Command classes should be automatically registered from the \\"cmds/\\" folder. Use longpoll technology, get updates from the telegram api.","completion":"To create a Telegram bot in PHP using OOP principles and following your specifications, we'll start by setting up a simple framework. This example will assume that you already have a bot token from BotFather on Telegram. First, let's outline what we need: 1. A \`CommandInterface\` that all command classes will implement. 2. A mechanism to automatically load command classes from the \`cmds/\` directory. 3. A main bot class that handles incoming updates and dispatches them to the correct command handler. 4. Use cURL for all network requests, particularly for fetching updates and sending messages. 5. Long polling to continuously check for updates. **Step 1: Setup** Create a project directory and within it, create these subdirectories and files: - \`index.php\` – the entry point of our bot. - \`Bot.php\` – our main bot class. - \`CommandInterface.php\` – our command interface. - \`cmds/\` – a directory where all specific command classes will reside. **Step 2: Define CommandInterface** \`\`\`php <?php // CommandInterface.php interface CommandInterface { public function execute(chat_id, arguments = null); } \`\`\` **Step 3: Setup Bot Class** \`\`\`php <?php // Bot.php class Bot { private token = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'; // Method to send requests to Telegram API private function sendRequest(method, params = []) { url = \\"https://api.telegram.org/bot{this->token}/{method}\\"; curl = curl_init(url); curl_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POST, true); curl_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, params); curl_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); response = curl_exec(curl); curl_close(curl); return json_decode(response, true); } // Method for fetching updates public function getUpdates(offset) { return this->sendRequest('getUpdates', ['offset' => offset]); } // Method for sending a message public function sendMessage(chat_id, text) { return this->sendRequest('sendMessage', ['chat_id' => chat_id, 'text' => text]); } // Function to load and return all command classes private function getCommandClasses() { commands = []; files = glob(__DIR__ .

For instance, a \`StartCommand.php\`: \`\`\`php <?php // cmds/StartCommand.php require_once 'CommandInterface.php'; class StartCommand implements CommandInterface { public function execute(chat_id, arguments = null) { global bot; // Assuming bot is an instance of Bot bot->sendMessage(chat_id, \\"Welcome to our Bot!\\"); } } \`\`\` **Step 5: Implement \`index.php\`** \`\`\`php <?php // index.php require_once 'Bot.php'; require_once 'CommandInterface.php'; // Assuming autoloading commands could be handled differently or with spl_autoload_register bot = new Bot(); bot->processUpdates(); \`\`\` This setup will: - Use cURL for all network requests. - Implement a basic command system with interface. - Implement long polling to continuously fetch updates. **Please Note:** - Replace \`'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE'\` with your actual Telegram bot token. - This example assumes you’re familiar with setting up a local server with PHP (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, native PHP server). - More sophisticated command parsing and error handling may be required for production bots."},{"prompt":"What is the use of \\"to + verb\\" form?","completion":"The \\"to + verb\\" form, often referred to as the infinitive form of a verb, serves several purposes in English. Its versatility makes it a fundamental component of the language, used in various syntactical constructions. Below are some of the primary uses of the \\"to + verb\\" form: 1. **To Indicate Purpose**: - It can be used to express why something is done. Example: \\"She went to the store to buy groceries.\\" 2. **As a Complement to Certain Verbs**: - Many verbs are followed by infinitives. Example: \\"She wants to leave.\\" 3. **After Adjectives**: - Infinitives can follow adjectives to complete or elaborate on their meaning. Example: \\"It is difficult to explain.\\" 4. **As a Subject or Object**: - The infinitive can act as the subject or object of a sentence. Example (Subject): \\"To learn a new language is exciting.\\" Example (Object): \\"I like to read.\\" 5. **Following Certain Nouns**: - Some nouns can be followed by an infinitive, often to specify a purpose or intention. Example: \\"The decision to leave was hard.\\" 6. **With Question Words**: - Infinitives are used after question words to form expressions of doubt, confusion, etc. Example: \\"I don’t know how to say it.\\" 7. **To Make Suggestions or Offers**: - Infinitives are used with auxiliary verbs like 'shall', 'will', or 'can' to suggest or offer. Example: \\"Shall we go to the cinema?\\" 8. **After Certain Prepositions**: - When used after prepositions, the infinitive can express purpose or intention. Example: \\"We saved some money to go on a vacation.\\" 9. **To Show Purpose or Intention Without a Specific Subject**: - Infinitives can generalize statements about purpose without specifying a subject.

(of legacies) The reduction or cancellation of legacies when the estate is insufficient to cover all the legacies provided for in the will or on intestacy after payment of the deceased's debts. The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provides that general legacies, unless given to satisfy a debt or for other consideration, abate in proportion to the amounts of those legacies; specific and demonstrative legacies then abate if the estate is still insufficient to pay all debts, and a demonstrative legacy also abates if the specified fund is insufficient to cover it. For example, A's estate may comprise a painting, £300 in his savings account, and £700 in other money; there are debts of £100 but his will leaves the painting to B, £500 from the savings account to C. £800 to D, and £200 to E. B will receive the painting, C's demonstrative legacy abates to £300, and after the debts are paid from the remaining £700, D's and E's general legacies abate proportionately, to £480 and £120 respectively. When annuities are given by the will, the general rule is that they are valued at the date of the testator's death, then abate proportionately in accordance with that valuation, and each annuitant receives the abated sum. All these rules are subject to any contrary intention being expressed in the will. 3. (in land law) Any reduction or cancellation of money payable. For example a lease may provide for an abatement of rent in certain circumstances, e.g. if the building is destroyed by fire, and a purchaser of land may claim an abatement of the price if the seller can prove his ownership of only part of the land he contracted to sell. 4. (of nuisances) The termination, removal, or destruction of a *nuisance. A person injured by a nuisance has a right to abate it. In doing so, he must not do more damage than is necessary and, if removal of the nuisance requires entry on to the property from which it emanates, he may have to give notice to the wrongdoer. A local authority can issue an abatement notice to control statutory nuisances. 5. (of proceedings) Thetermination of civil proceedings by operation of law, caused by a change of interest or status (e.g. bankruptcy or death) of one of the parties after the start but before the completion of the proceedings. An abatement did not prevent either of the parties from bringing fresh proceedings in respect of the same cause of action. Pleas in abatement have been abolished; in modern practice any change of interest or status of the parties does not affect the validity of the proceedings, provided that the cause of action survives.","completion":"| English | Farsi (Legal Language) | |---------|------------------------| | abatement n. 1. (of debts) The proportionate reduction in the payment of debts that takes place if a person's assets are insufficient to settle with his creditors in full. | تخفیف n. 1. (از بدهی‌ها) کاهش نسبی در پرداخت بدهی‌ها که در صورت ناکافی بودن دارایی‌های فرد برای تسویه کامل با طلبکارانش انجام می‌شود. | | 2. (of legacies) The reduction or cancellation of legacies when the estate is insufficient to cover all the legacies provided for in the will or on intestacy after payment of the deceased's debts. | 2. (از میراث‌ها) کاهش یا لغو میراث‌ها زمانی که دارایی برای پوشش تمام میراث‌های مقرر در وصیت‌نامه یا در صورت فقدان وصیت‌ نامه، بعد از پرداخت بدهی‌های متوفی، ناکافی باشد. | | The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provides that general legacies, unless given to satisfy a debt or for other consideration, abate in proportion to the amounts of those legacies; specific and demonstrative legacies then abate if the estate is still insufficient to pay all debts, and a demonstrative legacy also abates if the specified fund is insufficient to cover it. | قانون اداره املاک 1925 مقرر می‌دارد که میراث‌های عمومی، مگر آنکه برای ارضای بدهی یا به‌خاطر سایر ملاحظات اهدا شده باشند، به نسبت مبالغ آن میراث‌ها تخفیف می‌یابند؛ میراث‌های خاص و نمایشی سپس تخفیف می‌یابند اگر دارایی هنوز برای پرداخت تمام بدهی‌ها ناکافی باشد، و یک میراث نمایشی نیز تخفیف می‌یابد اگر صندوق مشخص شده برای پوشش آن ناکافی باشد. | | For example, A's estate may comprise a painting, £300 in his savings account, and £700 in other money; there are debts of £100 but his will leaves the painting to B, £500 from the savings account to C. £800 to D, and £200 to E. B will receive the painting, C's demonstrative legacy abates to £300, and after the debts are paid from the remaining £700, D's and E's general legacies abate proportionately, to £480 and £120 respectively. | به عنوان مثال، دارایی‌های A ممکن است شامل یک نقاشی، 300 پوند در حساب پس‌انداز و 700 پوند در سایر پول‌ها باشد؛ بدهی‌های به مبلغ 100 پوند وجود دارد اما وصیت‌نامه‌اش نقاشی را به B، 500 پوند از حساب پس‌انداز را به C، 800 پوند به D، و 200 پوند به E می‌بخشد. B نقاشی را دریافت می‌کند، میراث نمایشی C به 300 پوند تخفیف می‌یابد، و بعد از پرداخت بدهی‌ها از 700 پوند باقی‌مانده، میراث‌های عمومی D و E به نسبت، به ترتیب به 480 و 120 پوند تخفیف می‌یابند. | | When annuities are given by the will, the general rule is that they are valued at the date of the testator's death, then abate proportionately in accordance with that valuation, and each annuitant receives the abated sum. | زمانی که حقوق مستمری توسط وصیت تعیین می‌شود، قاعده عمومی این است که ارزش آن‌ها در تاریخ مرگ وصیت‌گذار تعیین می‌شود، سپس به نسبت این ارزیابی تخفیف می‌یابند، و هر دریافت‌کننده مستمری مبلغ تخفیف یافته را دریافت می‌کند. | | 3. (in land law) Any reduction or cancellation of money payable. For example a lease may provide for an abatement of rent in certain circumstances, e.g. if the building is destroyed by fire, and a purchaser of land may claim an abatement of the price if the seller can prove his ownership of only part of the land he contracted to sell. | 3. (در قانون اراضی) هرگونه کاهش یا لغو پول قابل پرداخت. به عنوان مثال، اجاره‌نامه ممکن است در شرایط خاصی برای تخفیف اجاره‌بها تدارک ببیند، مثلاً اگر ساختمان به دلیل آتش‌سوزی نابود شود، و خریدار زمین ممکن است در صورتی که فروشنده بتواند مالکیت خود را فقط بر بخشی از زمین که قرارداد فروش آن را بسته است، اثبات کند، ادعای تخفیف در قیمت را داشته باشد. | | 4. (of nuisances) The termination, removal, or destruction of a *nuisance. A person injured by a nuisance has a right to abate it. In doing so, he must not do more damage than is necessary and, if removal of the nuisance requires entry on to the property from which it emanates, he may have to give notice to the wrongdoer. | 4. (از مزاحمت‌ها) خاتمه، برداشتن، یا نابودی یک مزاحمت. فردی که توسط مزاحمت آسیب دیده حق دارد آن را تخفیف دهد. در این کار، نباید خسارات بیشتر از ضرورت ایجاد کند و، اگر برداشتن مزاحمت نیاز به ورود به ملکی داشته باشد که از آن سرچشمه می‌گیرد، ممکن است لازم باشد به مرتکب اطلاع دهد. | | A local authority can issue an abatement notice to control statutory nuisances. | مقام محلی می‌تواند اعلان تخفیف برای کنترل مزاحمت‌های قانونی صادر کند. | | 5. (of proceedings) The termination of civil proceedings by operation of law, caused by a change of interest or status (e.g. bankruptcy or death) of one of the parties after the start but before the completion of the proceedings. | 5. (از روندها) خاتمه دادرسی‌های مدنی توسط عملکرد قانون، ناشی از تغییر علاقه یا وضعیت (مثلاً ورشکستگی یا مرگ) یکی از طرفین پس از شروع اما قبل از تکمیل دادرسی‌ها. | | An abatement did not prevent either of the parties from bringing fresh proceedings in respect of the same cause of action. | تخفیف نمی‌تواند مانعی برای هر یک از طرفین در ارائه دادرسی‌های تازه در خصوص همان دلیل شکایت باشد. | | Pleas in abatement have been abolished; in modern practice any change of interest or status of the parties does not affect the validity of the proceedings, provided that the cause of action survives. | اعتراضات در خصوص تخفیف لغو شده‌اند؛ در عملکرد مدرن هرگونه تغییر علاقه یا وضعیت طرفین تاثیری بر اعتبار دادرسی‌ها ندارد، به شرطی که دلیل شکایت پابرجا باشد. |"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

L'avvocato Colombo ha espresso entusiasmo per questo traguardo, dichiarando: “Approvata la Carta dei diritti regionali sui disturbi dello spettro autistico”. Un passo avanti essenziale per assicurare una vita piena e indipendente a chi vive con l'autismo, in linea con le proprie possibilità e aspirazioni. La Carta stabilisce una serie di diritti fondamentali, tra cui quello a una diagnosi precisa e accessibile, alla partecipazione attiva nelle decisioni riguardanti il futuro e al rispetto dei desideri personali. Viene posto un forte accento sull'importanza di fornire le attrezzature, il supporto e l'assistenza necessari per consentire una vita produttiva, dignitosa e indipendente. “Ogni persona con disturbi dello spettro autistico deve poter partecipare, per quanto possibile, allo sviluppo o alla gestione dei servizi realizzati per il proprio benessere”, sottolinea l'avv.

Con queste nuove linee guida, Napoli e l'intera regione si pongono all'avanguardia nella tutela dei diritti delle persone autistiche, offrendo un modello virtuoso di giustizia e di sensibilità sociale da seguire.

But when Atlas threw the firmament from his shoulders, he was shocked that the sky did not crush the Earth, which he thought was the fate he was destined to hold, but only continued its movement around the world. And he asked himself - Why did Zeus entrust him with holding the firmament if the world did not need him. But at the same time he finally received freedom. (something akin this lines, if you would).","completion":"Atlant, the mighty Titan, had borne the weight of the heavens on his broad shoulders for eons, a punishment meted out by Zeus for his role in the Titans' rebellion. The firmament, a celestial sphere emblazoned with stars, stretched out infinitely above him, its weight unimaginable, pressing down with the force of fate itself. Day in and day out, Atlant stood at the center of the world, his feet planted firmly on the ground, his gaze forever lifted towards the vast expanse he carried. Time had lost all meaning, each moment indistinguishable from the next, an endless cycle of endurance. But even gods and Titans have their limits. One day, or perhaps it was night — for under the unending firmament, what difference did light or darkness make — Atlant felt the last vestiges of his resolve crumble. A weariness seeped into his bones, deeper than any fatigue of the flesh. It was a tiredness of the soul, born from the futility of his eternal task. In that moment of despair, he wondered at the cruelty of Zeus, to condemn him to a punishment so pointless, so devoid of end. \\"Why?\\" he whispered to the heavens, his voice echoing through the cosmos, unanswered. And then, with a fury born of desperation, Atlant decided no more. He bent his knees, feeling the ancient muscles creak and complain, gathering all the strength that had once allowed him to challenge gods. With a shout that split the sky, he heaved the firmament from his shoulders, expecting it to crash down upon the Earth, to bring an end to all things — perhaps even a release from his eternal torment. But the unthinkable happened. The sky, freed from Atlant’s grasp, simply continued its serene and eternal rotation around the Earth. The stars twinkled indifferently, the sun rose and set, and the moon continued its silent vigil. The world went on, untouched by the catastrophe that Atlant had envisioned. Stunned, Atlant watched as the sky upheld itself, a look of bewildered realization dawning across his features. The question echoed through his mind, insistent and unanswerable: Why had Zeus entrusted him with holding the firmament if the world did not need him? Had his punishment been nothing more than a cruel illusion, a task devoid of purpose except to demonstrate Zeus's power? Yet amid the whirlwind of his thoughts, a glimmer of something else began to take shape — a feeling so long forgotten that, at first, Atlant could scarce recognize it. Freedom. For the first time in uncounted ages, he could move without the crushing weight upon his shoulders. He could walk the Earth, explore its mysteries, and perhaps, in time, find a new purpose. And so, Atlant stepped forward, each step lighter than the last, a smile beginning to form on his lips. The world spread out before him, awash with possibilities. The story of the Titan who held the sky was over, but the story of Atlant, freed from the chains of destiny, was just beginning. In letting go, he had found himself, and though the path ahead was uncertain, for the first time in forever, it was his to choose."},{"prompt":"Isn't it cool concept?","completion":"Absolutely, it's a fascinating concept! The idea of reframing a classic myth, giving it a twist that not only challenges the original premise but also adds depth and modern relevance, is incredibly engaging. It encourages us to question the necessity of our burdens and the roles imposed upon us, whether by society, authority, or our own belief systems. By exploring Atlant's realization that the task he believed to be essential was, in fact, unnecessary, the story delves into themes of autonomy, purpose, and liberation. This reinterpretation also offers a fresh perspective on resilience, suggesting that sometimes, strength is not just about enduring but also about daring to let go and redefine our purpose. Furthermore, the story prompts reflection on the nature of authority and punishment, embodied by Zeus's seemingly arbitrary decree. It asks us to consider the power dynamics at play and whether the foundations of such structures are as solid as they appear or if they're built on misconceptions and false necessities. In essence, this reimagined take on the myth of Atlas not only revitalizes the story for a contemporary audience but also invites us to ponder on broader philosophical questions about freedom, the search for meaning, and the courage to question the status quo. It's a powerful narrative that resonates on a deeply human level, tapping into our intrinsic desires for understanding, belonging, and ultimately, liberation from unneeded burdens."},{"prompt":"Btw, have you ever heard about Atlas Pillars (in megastructural engineering context)?","completion":"Yes, the concept of Atlas Pillars in the context of megastructural engineering is a fascinating and theoretical idea inspired by science fiction and speculative engineering. It revolves around the idea of creating massive, planet-scale or even larger structural supports that could theoretically stabilize or modify planetary bodies, support immense structures, or even allow for the construction of habitable spaces in otherwise uninhabitable environments. The name \\"Atlas Pillars\\" is a nod to the mythological Atlas, who was said to hold up the sky, embodying the grand scale and ambition behind such engineering feats. In science fiction and futurist thought, concepts like Atlas Pillars extend into ideas about terraforming, space elevators, Dyson spheres, and other megastructures that might one day allow humanity to venture beyond the confines of Earth and live sustainably in outer space. These ideas are speculative and hinge on materials, energy sources, and technologies far beyond our current capabilities. However, they spark the imagination and offer visions of what might be possible in the far future. Engaging with such ideas can inspire innovation and push scientific research in new directions. While Atlas Pillars as physical structures remain within the realm of speculation and imagination, the fundamental desire to explore, understand, and eventually master our environment is a real and driving force in the advancement of science and engineering. Concepts like these serve as reminders of humanity's limitless creativity and its perpetual quest to reach beyond the known limits."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:I},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function F(n,e,l,u,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",P,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
